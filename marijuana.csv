“An overwhelming majority of Wisconsinites support restoring #Roe and legalizing marijuana.”,"While Wisconsinites were casting their votes for governor and other key offices during the Nov. 8, 2022 election, some also got a chance to share their opinion on two big issues: abortion policy and marijuana legalization. Several Wisconsin communities put the topics to an advisory referendum — a proposal put on the ballot to gauge voters’ opinions, but with no required government action as a result.    Gov. Tony Evers, who defeated Republican challenger Tim Michels to win another four years as the state’s top executive, advocated for abortion rights and marijuana legalization during his first term, though both pushes were stymied by the Republican-controlled Legislature. He took notice of the referendum results, tweeting this about them on Nov. 14, 2022: ""An overwhelming majority of Wisconsinites support restoring #Roe and legalizing marijuana.""  Roe, of course, refers to the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case guaranteeing a federal right to abortion, which the court overturned June 24, 2022.  Is Evers right? How many Wisconsinites want to restore Roe v. Wade and legalize weed?  Let’s take a look. To assess the claim, we’ll turn to the most recent results from the Marquette Law Poll, which regularly queries hundreds of Wisconsin voters on elections and key issues. Evers’ office pointed to both the poll results and referenda results as proof of his claim.  In results released Nov. 2, 2022, the last poll before the midterm election, interviewers asked a number of questions about Roe, including just what Evers was getting at: whether respondents favored or opposed its reversal.  A majority, 55%, opposed its reversal, while 37% favored it. Broken down by party, more than 92% of Democrats opposed the reversal, compared to 22% of Republicans. The margin of error on the survey, which tells us how much the poll results could differ from the real opinion of the entire population, was 4.6 percentage points.  The poll also asks about marijuana legalization. About two-thirds, or 64%, of respondents to the most recent poll that asked about it said it should be legalized, while 30% said the drug should stay illegal.  Earlier poll results show slightly higher opposition to Roe’s reversal – 60% in August and October, and 63% in September – and slightly higher support for marijuana legalization, which 69% of respondents to the August poll favored.   So there they are: the majorities that Evers spoke of. But there is something to note – he characterized the support as ""overwhelming."" That’s a subjective statement, but in our view Evers overstated it – particularly on the percentage who opposed the reversal of Roe. That’s more indicative of a wide split among those who responded.  Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette poll, said he doesn’t characterize how politicians describe the results, and that ""the numbers are the numbers, regardless of adjectives.""  Meanwhile, the advisory referenda — though they obviously surveyed specific portions of Wisconsin voters, not the entire state — showed wider majorities in favor of restoring abortion rights and legalizing marijuana.  The cities of Appleton, Racine, Kenosha, Stevens Point and Superior, along with Dane, Milwaukee and Eau Claire counties, put the non-binding marijuana question on the ballot. All were in favor of legalization, including some hefty majorities like Racine, where 76% of voters said they wanted the drug legalized.  Meanwhile, 86% of Dane County voters and 71% of voters in the city of Racine said they wanted to see Wisconsin’s abortion ban repealed. Again, though, the decisions are those of just a fraction of Wisconsinites. The statewide poll results offer evidence of Evers’ claim.  Evers said ""an overwhelming majority of Wisconsinites support restoring #Roe and legalizing marijuana.""  The latest Marquette Law poll shows clear majorities on both fronts, though support for restoring Roe v. Wade was not as overwhelming as Evers painted it to be",Mostly True,"December 2, 2022"
Reuters reported that Nancy Pelosi bought 10 million shares of cannabis stock.,"On Oct. 6, President Joe Biden said he would pardon all people convicted of simple marijuana possession offenses under federal law and directed Cabinet members to review how the drug is classified.  Later that day, a claim started to spread on social media that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., had bought millions of shares of cannabis stock before Biden’s announcement.  ""Breaking,"" reads one Oct. 7 Instagram post. ""Nancy Pelosi purchased 10,000,000 shares of $WEED 4 days ago."" The claim was attributed to Reuters, a news service headquartered in London.  ""Imagine that… #crooks,"" the post added. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) Reuters said in an Oct. 13 story about the claim that it did not report this. We found no evidence to contradict this.  Drew Hammill, a spokesperson for Pelosi, told PolitiFact the claim is false. Pelosi’s most recent publicly available financial disclosure report, signed by the speaker Oct. 14, reflects no such transaction. Nor did the previous report, signed Sept. 9, or any others filed this year.  Stock purchases by politicians and their potential for conflicts of interest have drawn increased scrutiny in recent years. And in December, Pelosi drew some criticism for rebuffing the idea of banning congressional lawmakers and their spouses from owning individual shares",False,"November 3, 2022"
“A quarter of the entire acreage in the country that is under hemp production is here in North Carolina.”,"Advocates for medical marijuana secured a small victory recently when North Carolina state senators passed a bill to legalize it, sending legislation to the state House. While the bill had broad support in the Senate, an Asheville-area senator called on lawmakers to amend it so that more local farmers can grow and sell the product. Sen. Julie Mayfield, D-Buncombe, said proposed regulations would exclude a large swath of local farmers because the bill requires licensees to produce the drug, process it and sell it at its own dispensaries. ""Indeed, a quarter of the entire acreage in the country that is under hemp production is here in North Carolina,"" Mayfield said in a speech on the senate floor. ""A quarter of the entire production in the country. These farmers and small business owners literally plowed the ground in North Carolina to make it fertile for the legalization of marijuana when we got to that point."" Mayfield’s claim suggesting that North Carolina is home to 25% of the nation’s hemp-producing acreage was included in stories by WRAL, the News & Observer, the North Carolina Insider newsletter and others. But it’s not true.  Shortly after emailing Mayfield, PolitiFact NC was contacted by a hemp policy advocate who took responsibility for the inaccurate statistic.  Nicolette Baglio, who owns a hemp business in western North Carolina, said she and other hemp advocates have been tracking North Carolina’s proposal. Baglio said her group didn’t learn about the Senate’s scheduled vote until just hours beforehand. In a rush to compile information about North Carolina’s hemp industry, Baglio said her team miscalculated the state’s hemp production and then included it in an email sent to every senator. Speaking to PolitiFact, Mayfield argued that, despite the error, her broader point is valid because, although her percentage was off, North Carolina remains a top producer of hemp. ""This bill, while taking a long overdue step, shuts out N.C. businesses and farmers and will make already large, wealthy, out of state companies larger and wealthier at the expense of small hemp farmers and businesses,"" Mayfield said in an email. ""We should work harder to figure out a way to let our homegrown businesses benefit from this new market and keep our dollars in-state rather than let our dollars flow to out-of-state cannabis corporations."" The U.S. Department of Agriculture in February released a report on hemp production across the country during 2021. The department tracked hemp that was planted and harvested in each state. North Carolina planted 4% of the nation’s industrial hemp last year – accounting for 2,150 of the U.S.’s total 54,152 acres of hemp planted. Seven other states planted more: Colorado, Montana, Oklahoma, Texas, California, Minnesota and Utah. North Carolina was an even larger producer of harvested hemp. North Carolina harvested 5.5% of the nation’s industrial hemp — 1,850 of the nation’s 33,480 acres. North Carolina and Oregon are tied for sixth in harvesting industrial hemp, behind Montana, Colorado, Minnesota, California, and Utah.  Baglio said her team initially thought that North Carolina accounted for 25% of U.S. hemp production because they compared a statistic from Hemp Industry Daily — which said the state has 14,016 acres available for hemp growth — with the USDA report that 54,152 acres of hemp was planted last year.  Mayfield said she wrote Baglio’s talking point in her notes, which she can be seen reading from in video footage of the senate debate. Baglio apologized for providing Mayfield with the wrong stat, saying the rest of the group’s information is accurate and that Mayfield is a trustworthy lawmaker. ""She has truly been one of the only legislators that I feel like has listened to her constituents and has taken up some of the main issues at hand and that [the bill] is essentially cutting out the entire industry that paved the way"" for medical marijuana, Baglio said. Mayfield said ""a quarter of the entire acreage in the country that is under hemp production is here in North Carolina."" That’s not true. North Carolina has planted about 4% of the nation’s hemp and harvested about 5.5% of it, according to a USDA report released in February",False,"June 13, 2022"
"Cannabis reform ""is supported by the majority of the residents of our state, including a majority of Republicans.""","The effort to make marijuana legal at the federal level gained ground as the U.S. House passed a measure April 1, 2022 that would eliminate criminal penalties for anyone who manufactures, distributes or possesses the substance.  The proposal faces an uncertain future in the U.S. Senate, but a Wisconsin state senator who has advocated for similar reforms in the state argues the time is right for such a move. ""The people of Wisconsin are ready for cannabis reform,"" state Sen. Melissa Agard, D-Madison, said in an April 11, 2022 tweet. ""It is supported by the majority of the residents of our state, including a majority of Republicans.""  The last part of the tweet caught our attention. There have long been differing views on permitting marijuana for medicinal uses, when compared to outright legalization. Has the needle on legalization really moved that far? When asked to provide backup for her claim, Agard’s office cited a Marquette Law School poll of 802 registered Wisconsin voters taken from Feb. 22 to 27, 2022. It has a margin of error of 3.8 percentage points for the full sample.  A summary of the poll noted that ""support for legalization of marijuana has grown since the question was first asked in 2013, with 61% now in favor of legalization and 31% now opposed."" It also noted that support has grown in each partisan group since that time, with a slim majority of Republicans now supporting legalization. According to the poll, 51% of those who identified as Republican supported legalization, while 42% were opposed and 7% undecided. (In 2013, the situation was the virtual opposite – 43% support, 51% opposed). In the new poll, among Democrats, 75% supported legalization, with 19% opposed. Another 5% said they didn’t know. Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll, said Agard’s statement ""is basically right, but depends on whether ‘Republican’ includes those who say they are independent but lean Republican or not."" Franklin said that for many purposes the MU poll includes leaners with partisans, but ""for other analysis we keep them separate.""  In this case, the 51% figure included independents who lean Republican.  Indeed, those who say they are ""Republican"" are still just slightly more opposed to legalization, by 0.6 percentage points. The ""leaners"" are much more likely to support legalization, which dramatically shifts the over picture.      Party                  Legal          Illegal                     Don’t know 1 Rep       46.5    47.1         6.43        2 Lean Rep  59.2    33.6         7.20        3 Ind       60.2    27.6         11.5     4 Lean Dem  79.6    16.9         3.52        5 Dem       71.5    20.8         6.51      Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, noted cannabis reform can mean many different things including changing regulations about buying, selling, and using marijuana for either medicinal or recreational purposes.  ""What share of Wisconsinites support changing laws surely depends on exactly what kind of reform is being proposed,"" Burden said.  ""It appears that Democrats and Independents in Wisconsin are generally supportive of legalization but that Republicans' opinions probably depend more on the kind of reform being considered."" The results of the Wisconsin poll are on par with residents across the United States.  A CBS News poll released April 20, 2022, found that two-thirds of Americans want recreational marijuana use to be legal under federal law and in their own state. And most people said they wouldn't mind if a licensed marijuana business opened in their neighborhood. Most Democrats, liberals, independents and moderates favor legalization under federal law, the poll found, but Republicans and conservatives are split on the issue, mainly based on age.  In terms of supporting legalization,  79% of Democrats, 67% of independents and 49% of Republicans were in favor. Opposed were 21% of Democrats, 33% of independents and 51% of Republicans.  The picture changes when age is added to the equation for Republicans.  When looking just at Republicans under age 45, some 59% said it should be legal and 41% opposed legalization. For Republicans over age 45, some 44% said it should be legal, and 56% said it should not be legal.  Agard claimed cannabis reform ""is supported by the majority of the residents of our state, including a majority of Republicans.""  Recent polling of Wisconsin residents found  61% in favor of legalization and 31% opposed. Among Republicans, 51% supported legalization, while 42% were opposed.  But that comes with a footnote: To reach the 51% level, one has to include those who identify as Republican, as well as those who lean Republican. This is often done in polling, so it’s not surprising here. But it is worth noting",True,"April 29, 2022"
"“Every 37 seconds, someone is arrested for possession of marijuana.”","Gary Chambers Jr., a Democrat who hopes to represent Louisiana in the U.S. Senate, made headlines by releasing a 37-second political ad in which he smokes marijuana while reciting a number of statistics about marijuana laws and how they’re enforced. ""Every 37 seconds, someone is arrested for possession of marijuana,"" Chambers said, his narration playing over the sound of a ticking timer. ""Since 2010, state and local police have arrested an estimated 7.3 million Americans for violating marijuana laws — over half of all drug arrests.""  He continued: ""Black people are four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana laws than white people. States waste $3.7 billion enforcing marijuana laws every year. Most of the people police are arresting aren’t dealers, but rather people with small amounts of pot, just like me."" My first campaign ad, ‘37 Seconds.’ #JustLikeMeI hope this ad works to not only destigmatize the use of marijuana, but also forces a new conversation that creates the pathway to legalize this beneficial drug, and forgive those who were arrested due to outdated ideology. pic.twitter.com/G0qKvmUGKD While many news outlets focused on Chambers’ surprising use of marijuana in a political ad, PolitiFact wanted to dig into the data he cites. We found that Chamber’s claim was based on 2010 data that referred to marijuana arrests generally. But the 37 second figure doesn’t hold up when compared with recent figures specific to marijuana possession, which have slowed in recent years, due in part to state changes in legalization. The ad cited the American Civil Liberties Union as a data source. A spokesperson for the Chambers campaign said the team primarily pulled its numbers from an ACLU report published in June 2013 and a slideshow that appeared to be based on the same report. ""We additionally spoke with a variety of experts in the cannabis lobbying space to ensure we had industry-accepted numbers,"" added campaign spokesperson Katie Dolan. She pointed out that the ACLU’s landing page for the 2013 report and the slideshow both said that ""cops made one pot bust every 37 seconds."" The ACLU report said its annual marijuana arrest data was ""obtained largely"" from FBI Uniform Crime Reporting data. The FBI’s UCR program annually collects law enforcement data from various city, university and college, county, state, tribal, and federal law enforcement agencies.  The data has its limitations: Participation in the UCR program is voluntary, definitions of crimes can vary among local jurisdictions, and the same information is not always reported year to year. The ACLU noted that some areas (Illinois, Florida, the District of Columbia, and the five boroughs of New York City) do not report data on marijuana possession arrests by race to the FBI, so records requests were filed to obtain that data. Within the report, the ACLU drilled into the specifics: ""In 2010 alone, there were 889,133 marijuana arrests — 300,000 more than arrests for all violent crimes combined — or one every 37 seconds."" The ACLU referenced ""marijuana arrests"" generally, meaning the number includes people arrested for crimes beyond just possession, such as dealing, so Chambers’ claim is off in that regard.  In 2010, there were 784,021 marijuana possession arrests, according to the ACLU. Using that value, arrests occurred at a pace less frequent than once every 37 seconds.   In an updated report issued in 2020, the ACLU again relied on UCR data to examine marijuana arrests from 2010 to 2018. And though it did not include an updated figure about how frequently marijuana arrests occurred, PolitiFact reached out to experts about what more recent data indicates. Experts say that arrests now occur less frequently.  Aaron Madrid Aksoz, an ACLU spokesperson, said data current through 2018 now shows there were ""6.1 million marijuana-related arrests between 2010 and 2018."" From there, he calculated that there was one marijuana-related arrest every 46.56 seconds. Paul Armentano, deputy director of the pro-marijuana legalization organization NORML, said annual state-level marijuana-related arrests have been trending downward since about 2009. Data from 2019 and 2020 showed significant drops in marijuana-related arrests. The decrease coincides with the increased legalization of marijuana. Colorado was the first state to legalize recreational marijuana with a 2012 ballot initiative, and since then, 17 other states, Washington, D.C., and Guam have decriminalized recreational marijuana.  Jon Gettman, an associate professor of criminal justice at Shenandoah University, has extensively researched data on marijuana arrests and helped the ACLU compile its 2013 report. Gettman used 2019 FBI data to do his calculations and concluded there was one marijuana-related arrest every 58 seconds. Matt Sutton of Drug Policy Alliance used the FBI’s estimated number of arrests in 2020 to run the calculations using the most recent data available from UCR. It showed there were about 1.16 million ""drug abuse violation"" arrests in 2020.  Of those arrests, 2.8% were for selling or manufacturing marijuana and 27.5% were for possession, for a total of about 350,150 marijuana-related arrests and 317,793 marijuana possession arrests. Those calculations, then, show that in 2020, there was one marijuana-related arrest every 90 seconds, and one marijuana possession arrest about every 99 seconds. Chambers’ other claims in the ad have varying degrees of accuracy.  ""Since 2010, state and local police have arrested an estimated 7.3 million Americans for violating marijuana laws — over half of all drug arrests."" This could use a little more context. FBI data shows that about 7.35 million marijuana arrests have been made since 2010. But the proportion of drug arrests that were marijuana-related has been decreasing. In 2018, marijuana-related arrests accounted for 40% of all drug arrests in the U.S. In 2020, that share has fallen to 30.3%.  ""Black people are four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana laws than white people."" That’s accurate when rounding up. The campaign drew that data from ACLU’s 2013 and 2020 reports.  ""States waste $3.7 billion enforcing marijuana laws every year."" The figure seems to be based on very general figures about how much the U.S. spends on police protection. The U.S. spent $100 billion on police protection in 2017, according to a Bureau of Justice Statistics report. Marijuana arrests accounted for about 6.3% of all arrests that year. Assuming broadly that the percentage of arrests is equivalent to the percentage of costs, the U.S. seems to spend significantly more than $3.7 billion enforcing marijuana laws each year. Whether it’s a waste is a matter of opinion. ""Most of the people police are arresting aren’t dealers, but rather people with small amounts of pot."" That’s true. Using FBI data, the ACLU reports show that the vast majority of marijuana-related arrests are for possession. In 2020, FBI data indicated that about 91% of marijuana arrests were for possession.   Chambers said, ""Every 37 seconds, someone is arrested for possession of marijuana."" The claim was based on 2010 data that dealt with marijuana-related arrests, but it is outdated now.  Experts, including a spokesperson for the ACLU, say that more recent data indicates that marijuana-related arrests now happen less frequently — at a rate of about one every 46 seconds, 58 seconds or 90 seconds, depending on how you approach the math problem. And 2020 data suggests an arrest for marijuana possession alone occurs every 99 seconds — still frequent, but a far slower rate than Chambers’ ad suggests",Mostly False,"January 24, 2022"
“Over 75% of (North Carolina) supports medical marijuana.”,"North Carolina lawmakers are considering a bill that would allow physicians to prescribe marijuana for some medical issues. North Carolina is among a minority of states that haven’t legalized any form of marijuana. A key state Senate committee recently gave preliminary approval to Senate Bill 711, which would allow cannabis as a treatment for cancer, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, PTSD and other comparable debilitating conditions. Ahead of the meeting, Democratic state Sen. Wiley Nickel claimed that most North Carolinians support medicinal marijuana. ""Even though over 75% of the state supports medical marijuana we still have an uphill battle for final passage in the Republican controlled Legislature,"" tweeted Nickel, who’s raising money to run for Congress. Is support for medicinal marijuana really that high? Not consistently. Generally speaking, national polls show rising support for marijuana legalization. In 2018, PolitiFact reported that support for legal marijuana rose from 35% to 62% in only ten years. Gallup, which has been polling on the issue since 1969, found last year that a record high 68% of Americans support full legalization. And earlier this year, the Pew Research Center found that 91% of Americans believe marijuana should be legal in some form.  North Carolinians, meanwhile, haven’t been polled many times on whether medical marijuana should be legalized. While available polls show support for the issue, Nickel is slightly exaggerating their enthusiasm. In 2015, a Public Policy Polling poll found that 69% of 845 North Carolina registered voters supported marijuana for medicinal use. The margin of error was 3.4%. In 2017, an Elon University poll found that 80% of 506 North Carolina voters said in a live-caller telephone survey that they support the idea. The margin of error was 4.36%. In 2020, a Nexstar/Emerson College poll found that 73% of 717 registered voters approved of medical marijuana. The margin of error was 3.6%. In 2021, another Elon University poll found that 73% support among 1,455 North Carolinians who were polled in an online survey. The poll’s ""credibility interval"" was 2.7%. These numbers are high, but not consistently above 75% like Nickel said. Nickel’s office, for its part, cited a News & Observer story that described medical marijuana support in the state as being ""nearly"" 75%. David McLennan, a political science professor who runs the Meredith College Poll, says he’s skeptical that more than 75% of North Carolinians support medicinal marijuana.  ""Seems to me that North Carolinians generally favor medical marijuana being legalized,"" McLennan said. ""The support—at least as indicated by the four polls—suggests that support is pretty consistent and does not appear to be growing."" Wiley Nickel said ""over 75% of the state supports medical marijuana."" Nickel is rounding up. Support for medical marijuana surpassed 75% in only one of the four polls we found dating back to 2015. That said, each of the four polls show support for medicinal marijuana around 70% or higher. So he’s not far off.

The use and possession of marijuana on U.S. college campuses “remains prohibited under federal law”,"In late March, New York state lawmakers passed — and Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed — a bill that legalized recreational marijuana statewide. Soon after, students at SUNY’s University at Albany received an email from Clarence McNeill, the dean of students, the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle reported on Apr. 7. In the email, McNeill wrote: ""Despite this change to state law, the use and possession of marijuana on UAlbany’s campuses remains prohibited under federal law."" Is it correct that New York state’s recreational marijuana legalization would have no effect on the state’s college campuses? That’s largely correct, but with some legal gray areas, experts say. While McNeill’s words were addressed specifically to University at Albany students, the same federal law barring marijuana at the University at Albany would also apply to other campuses in states that have legalized recreational marijuana. (McNeill could not be reached for comment.) The Controlled Substances Act is a federal law that was enacted in 1971. Under the law, marijuana is categorized as a ""Schedule I"" drug, defined as having ""no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and a high potential for abuse.""  Schedule I drugs are classified as illegal, and years-long efforts by marijuana advocates and lawmakers to change that classification have not succeeded. However, there is a bit of a gray area. While federal law designates marijuana as an illegal substance, the federal government isn’t, as a practical matter, enforcing that part of the law today, said Mason Tvert, a communications advisor for Vicente Sederberg LLP and former director of communications for the Marijuana Policy Project. ""It’s not like DEA agents are going to come in and make an arrest for individual possession, because then they would have to refer it to the Justice Department and they wouldn’t prosecute that,"" Tvert said. Jonathan Caulkins, a professor of operations research and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, agreed. ""The federal government doesn’t really pursue marijuana charges,"" Caulkins said. Even if the Biden administration steers clear of changing marijuana’s scheduling under the Controlled Substances Act, Caulkins said, the administration is unlikely to change the current hands-off prosecution policies for simple marijuana possession. On the one hand, state, local, and campus police forces that have jurisdiction over campuses in states with legalized recreational marijuana would not have a law to use in arresting students of legal age for simple marijuana possession, Tvert said. However, it is within a college’s rights to prohibit marijuana possession or use on its campus, and many universities have such policies in place for their students, Caulkins said. The patchwork of sometimes conflicting laws worries some institutions, Caulkins said. ""There are various federal contractors that are understandably concerned about the inconsistencies between federal and state law and, frankly, between federal law and federal law,"" Caulkins said. Tvert said it makes sense for universities to be concerned that federal funding could be at risk if they involve allow marijuana use. McNeill wrote, ""Despite this change to state law, the use and possession of marijuana on … campuses remains prohibited under federal law."" He is correct that marijuana possession and use has been illegal under federal law for four decades. That said, the federal government does not typically prosecute marijuana possession and use cases, leaving it up to states to either enforce their own laws against marijuana or else legalize the drug within the state’s borders. However, even in states that have legalized the recreational use of marijuana, universities can still choose to ban the drug from their campuses",Mostly True,"June 7, 2021"
“Regulating and taxing marijuana—much like we do alcohol—would generate more than $165M in revenue starting in 2022”,"Gov. Tony Evers proposed that Wisconsin keep up with three of its neighbors and legalize marijuana, but the plan has already gone up in smoke. The GOP-controlled Legislature’s budget-writing committee on May 6, 2021 removed legalizing marijuana -- and hundreds of other provisions -- from the governor’s proposed 2021-’23 spending plan. In making the changes, and starting fresh, the panel created a gap of about $3.4 billion.  With that gap, and polls showing general public support for legalized marijuana, it brought to mind a claim from Evers that we had set aside: ""Regulating and taxing marijuana — much like we do alcohol — would generate more than $165M in revenue starting in 2022,"" Evers tweeted April 14, 2021.  In all, 36 states have medical marijuana programs (including Iowa), while 14 states -- including neighboring Illinois and Michigan -- have legalized marijuana for recreational use: But what about the money? Is Evers correct that his plan would add $165 million to the state’s coffers in the upcoming budget?  When asked for backup to the claim, Britt Cudaback, Evers’ communications director, pointed us to the state’s ""Budget in Brief"" document, released in February 2021, which includes more detail on how his plan would work. Under the plan, the state Department of Revenue would issue permits to those wishing to sell recreational marijuana. ""The Governor’s proposal imposes a 15 percent excise tax on the sales price of each wholesale sale by a permit-holding producer to a permit-holding processor,"" according to the budget document. ""In addition, the proposal imposes a 10 percent excise tax on the sales price of each retail sale. Retail sales, except for medical use, would be subject to the sales tax.""  So, how did the governor arrive at that $165 million figure? According to Cudaback, the budget office looked at data from other states, including Colorado, which was the first state to legalize marijuana, and made adjustments for population and ""reported marijuana usage."" She noted that other states have relied on Colorado’s data in developing their own budgets, and noted that the estimates were on the conservative side, meaning they could be closer to the low end of potential tax revenue. According to the Evers figures, if sales were to begin Jan. 1, 2022 -- roughly six months after expected passage of the budget -- $165.8 million would be reached if tax collections were $19 per-capita. That is, if -- on average -- every person in the state bought enough marijuna to generate $19 in annual tax revenue. Here is the math: $19 per capita per year x 5.8 million population x 1.5 years = $165.8 million. That includes a projected $65 million from taxes on sales at the wholesale level, $67.1 million from retail taxes and $33.6 million from the sales tax.  It’s difficult to compare states because of their varying size and different taxing structures around marijuana sales.  For instance, Illinois has a lower excise tax, but far higher sales taxes on recreational marijuana, and more than double Wisconsin’s population. According to the Public Policy Forum, a non-partisan think tank that has analyzed the Wisconsin budget, Illinois likely collected around $175 million in revenue in its first year of recreational implementation.  That’s not much more -- despite twice the population size -- than what Evers is anticipating. The administration's estimate appears to imply a pretty rapid implementation, the Policy Forum said.  Nevada, meanwhile, has a 15% tax on wholesale sales and a 10% tax on retail sales, so its framework is generally similar. In fiscal year 2020, with just over half of Wisconsin’s population, Nevada collected $105.2 million. That said, the Policy Forum notes Nevada’s unique tourism industry -- i.e., legalized gambling -- may make it a poor basis for comparison. Andrew Reschovsky, University of Wisconsin-Madison Professor Emeritus of Public Affairs and Applied Economics pointed out that ""forecasting revenue from a new tax is always difficult."" He said the State Budget Office has taken the ""sensible"" approach and based its estimates on the experience of other states that have already legalized marijuana sales. But that doesn’t mean it’s sure to come true.  ""The Administration’s forecast, like all revenue forecasts, is based on a set of assumptions,"" he wrote. ""While some of the Administration’s assumptions may result in an under-estimate of tax revenues, I do worry that the state may be overly optimistic about the time needed to implement the issuing of both medical and recreational marijuana retail sales licenses and the time needed to open retail outlets throughout the state.""  In other words, the state may not be able to get a system up and running in time to meet the Jan. 1, 2022 date the budget projections are based upon. ""Based on the experiences in Massachusetts and California, this may be an overly optimistic estimate of the time it takes to license and open retail sales outlets,"" Reschovsky wrote. ""If the rollout process is in fact slower than anticipated, revenue during the next biennium may be lower than the Administration’s forecast."" Evers tweeted ""Regulating and taxing marijuana — much like we do alcohol — would generate more than $165M in revenue starting in 2022.  Experts consulted by PolitiFact Wisconsin, generally speaking, had no quarrel with the state’s math, but questioned the implementation schedule baked into the estimates. In other words, if legalized marijuana were to go forward, it may not generate the revenue Evers claimed because it may take too long to get a licensing system in place, and to license and open retail outlets. In a nutshell, the Evers projections are plausible, but may be overly optimistic",Mostly True,"May 12, 2021"
"""In fact, the data coming in from some states that have legalized marijuana is that they actually see a decrease in use over time, particularly among young people.""","New York state legislators and Gov. Andrew Cuomo have approved a law allowing recreational use, production and sale of marijuana for people over age 21. State Sen. Liz Krueger, a Democrat from Manhattan, has long sponsored legislation to legalize marijuana. During the Senate debate, she said: ""In fact, the data coming in from some states that have legalized marijuana is that they actually see a decrease in use over time, particularly among young people."" Given concerns about whether young people will be more inclined to use marijuana, even if it is legal only for people age 21 and older, we wondered if reliable data supported Krueger’s point.  We reached out to Krueger’s office, and a spokesman, Justin Flagg, sent us several studies.  In Colorado, the legal sale of recreational marijuana began in 2014. Four years later, Colorado’s Division of Criminal Justice published a study about the effects of legalization, and found that between 2005 and 2017 the proportion of Colorado high school students reporting using marijuana ever in their lifetime had modest fluctuations but remained statistically unchanged. Also, the study found no statistically significant difference between Colorado student responses compared to national data. The proportion of students reporting they had used marijuana in the last 30 days was also stable, with no significant changes, from 2005 to 2017.  A year after that report, the Healthy Kids Colorado Survey found that youth marijuana use had ticked up slightly from the previous survey, and was up less than 1 percentage point from just before legal sales began. Survey authors reported there had been no significant change since 2005.  Other studies also suggested no change in youth use in Colorado. In 2018, a study in Prevention Science showed that for high school students there were no significant changes in marijuana use when they were asked if they had used it ever, or in the last 30 days.   In Washington state, which legalized recreational marijuana in 2012, a study from the Rand Corp. and others published in JAMA Pediatrics in 2018 found a small decrease in youth use, but warned that more data is needed to identify long-term trends. Marijuana use dropped a small, but statistically significant amount among eighth graders and 10th graders in Washington state following legalization, in 2014 and 2016, compared with 2010 and 2012, researchers wrote. Among eighth graders, prevalence of marijuana use fell from 9.8 percent to 7.3 percent. Among 10th graders, use fell from 19.8 percent to 17.8 percent. No changes were reported among 12th graders. A 2019 study in the American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse found that there were not significant shifts in use among youth overall in places that had decriminalized marijuana, ""but predicted significant declines in marijuana use among 14-year olds and those of Hispanic and other ancestry (1.7-4.4 percentage points), and significant increases among white adolescents (1.6 percentage points)."" In a research letter published in JAMA Pediatrics in 2019, researchers wrote that based on their analysis of surveys in states that had legalized recreational adult-use marijuana, youth use ""may actually"" decline. Recreational marijuana laws were associated with an 8 percent decrease in the likelihood of marijuana use and a 9 percent decrease in the likelihood of frequent marijuana use.    Study author D. Mark Anderson, an associate professor of economics at Montana State University, told PolitiFact earlier this year that researchers interpreted their results as consistent with the argument that as licensed dispensaries that require proof of age replace drug dealers, marijuana becomes more difficult for teens to obtain.     We talked to three academic researchers who study marijuana legalization, and they all said that there is not a definitive link between legalization and lower use by minors.  Magdalena Cerda, an associate professor at New York University Grossman School of Medicine, was a co-author of the Rand study. That study found a decrease in adolescent marijuana use after legalization, but it didn’t have a comparison group, therefore it’s unclear whether the decrease was due to legalization, or whether, in the absence of legalization, the decrease would have been larger, Cerda said. Another of Cerda’s studies, published in 2019 in JAMA Psychiatry, found no change in use among adolescents, but a potential small increase in cannabis use disorder, particularly among adolescents who had previously used marijuana. Based on the JAMA Psychiatry study and the JAMA Pediatrics study, Cerda said, ""I think this suggests that we don’t see an increase in use among the general population of adolescents in the short-term aftermath following legalization."" As for problematic use among existing users, the finding is very preliminary and requires further study, she said.      Katharine Neill Harris, a fellow in drug policy at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University, said that youth use has been on a decline since the early 2000s, before any state legalized recreational marijuana. In looking at youth use since legalization, Colorado’s data is best, and that it shows that marijuana use by high school students has been stable, she said.  In states that have legalized, increases or decreases have been very small, Harris said. Meanwhile, among adults, marijuana use is increasing nationwide, including in states that have legalized, she said. She pointed us to a study published in July 2020 from the University of Washington, which showed that reductions in teen use could be slowed by legalization, meaning that teen use could have decreased more without legalization. The Washington study followed a smaller group of young people over time, which offers a different analysis than point-in-time survey data from a larger group.  It’s still too early to make any definitive conclusions about whether legalization impacts youth use, she said.   Jonathan P. Caulkins, a past co-director of the Rand Drug Policy Research Center and a professor at Carnegie Mellon University, said there are 15 states and multiple indicators from which advocates can pick statistics. The overall finding, Caulkins said, is that legalization for adults was accompanied by stable rates for youth overall, but youth rates of risky behaviors such as smoking, drinking, getting drunk, and other indicators are all down. ""Some of us guess that legalization has offset or erased what otherwise would have been progress,"" he said.  Still, the effect of legalization is small, if any, he said. The reasons for this are that legalization was only for adults, not kids, and that marijuana was already widely available even where it was prohibited and that in many states, legalization came after medical marijuana was permitted in brick and mortar stores, broadening legal access.  ""It has been less bad for kids than we feared it might be, and it is definitely not bad and might even be level, but it is just not right to say that a fair and comprehensive look at the data concludes that kids have been helped by legalization in that way,"" Caulkins said.   PolitiFact has fact-checked similar claims.  In 2019, PolitiFact found that adult use in Colorado through 2017 rose, as it had been trending before legalization, while youth use remained the same or decreased a little",Mostly False,"April 9, 2021"
"""Pot today is not the weed baby boomers were smoking.""","Wisconsin Republicans have been blunt about their opposition to legalizing marijuana.  Gov. Tony Evers proposed legalizing recreational and medical marijuana in his 2021-’23 state budget as a way to bring in more revenue that he’d put toward rural schools and marginalized communities. Some GOP lawmakers have signaled they could support medical use, but the measure is not given much hope for passage.   State Rep. Barbara Dittrich, R-Oconomowoc, published a column on her legislative web page on Feb. 16, 2021 titled ""Gaslighting Marijuana"" that touched on a range of arguments against legalization. One line in particular caught our eye. ""There is the pervasive, false perception that marijuana is not dangerous,"" Dittrich wrote. ""Pot today is not the weed baby boomers were smoking."" Is Dittrich right that modern marijuana is different than the grass of Woodstock past? Dittrich’s argument centers around the amount of THC — the chemical that produces a high — in dried marijuana leaves and wax used for vaping devices. When asked for evidence to support her claim, an aide provided links to several articles about the drug and its health impacts. In 2015, Andy LaFrate of the marijuana testing lab Charas Scientific said the average potency of marijuana the lab tested had reached 20% THC — an increase from where it was 20 or 30 years prior. ""I would say the average potency of marijuana has probably increased by a factor of at least three,"" LaFrate said in a video from the American Chemical Society.  That tracks with other research done on this topic. One study in 2019 found marijuana potency on average increased from 8.9% in 2008 to 17.1% in 2017. Another group of researchers indicated THC amounts were as low as 4% in 1995.  By contrast, THC content reached 22% and 67% in parts of the Netherlands, according to a study in Europe. Products with an average potency of 14% represented most of the London street market, while Italy, France and Spain saw marijuana with less than 10% THC. Today’s potency depends in part on whether the marijuana comes from the legal or black market, said Susan Weiss, director of the Division of Extramural Research at the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Marijuana recently seized by the Drug Enforcement Administration tests between 12 to 14% on average, she said, compared to 3% or less in the 1970s and 1980s. But dispensaries sell products with up to 20% THC. The change over time can be attributed to several factors, Weiss said: Marijuana back in the day was largely imported from Mexico, and potency would have decreased as it sat before being distributed. People also know more about the genetics of the plant now and can grow it in more controlled environments. Plus, the demand exists for a stronger product. ""Just as you can breed for better tomatoes, you can breed for higher potency plants,"" Weiss said. Marijuana users also have more options today by way of concentrates like wax and oil that can be used for vaping — which are even stronger than dried cannabis.  In 2014, the head of the DEA told lawmakers that the THC content of those products averaged 54%, with some as high as 99%. According to NIDA, solvent-based products range on average from 54 to 69% THC, while non-solvent products have levels between 39 to 60%. In a column, Dittrich said ""pot today is not the weed baby boomers were smoking."" Research shows that the THC content of marijuana has increased significantly since the 1970s amid shifting trends in the industry and a greater understanding of the cannabis plant",True,"March 19, 2021"
"""Youth usage of marijuana has actually gone down in states that have fully legalized.”","Wisconsin’s Republican lawmakers may have made clear that Gov. Tony Evers’ plan to legalize marijuana in the next state budget will go up in smoke, but state Sen. Melissa Agard, D-Madison, isn’t backing down.  Agard has pushed the state for years to legalize the drug for both medicinal and recreational purposes, a proposal that garnered little traction under former Gov. Scott Walker and the Republican-controlled Legislature.  Today, though, the dynamic is different. Legalization could generate $166 million in revenue that could help fund rural schools and programs for communities that have been disproportionately affected by past marijuana laws, Evers said when he announced the plan.  Wisconsin is one of just 14 states that has not legalized marijuana in some form. Fifteen states have legalized recreational marijuana over the past few years, including neighboring Illinois and Michigan, and Minnesota lawmakers have introduced a bill that would do the same.  Public support of the idea is also growing in Wisconsin. A 2019 Marquette University Law School poll found 59% of Wisconsin voters backed legalization for recreational purposes, and 83% backed it for medicinal purposes.  Still, Republican leaders of the Legislature’s budget committee wasted little time in shooting down the proposal. Though Sen. Howard Marklein, R-Spring Green, said he believed it was ""too big"" to be inserted into the state budget, Sen Chris Kapenga, R-Delafield, worried about health effects of the drug on kids who choose to use it.  We rated Kapenga's claim linking youth marijuana use and psychological disorders True. But Agard jumped in to make another point:  ""Youth usage of marijuana has actually gone down in states that have fully legalized,"" she tweeted back.  It’s an important claim, because those opposed to legalization often claim that the move will cause a dramatic uptick in teens smoking pot. But is it correct?  Let’s take a look.  Along with her statement, Agard tweeted a link to an analysis on marijuana laws and teen use of the drug from JAMA Pediatrics, a peer-reviewed journal published by the American Medical Association.  The analysis, published July 8, 2019, pooled data from each state’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey from 1993 to 2017 to examine the association between legalization and teen marijuana use.  Averaging the survey data from seven states that passed recreational marijuana laws from 2012 to 2017 — Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada and Washington — researchers found an 8% decrease in the likelihood of youth marijuana use and a 9% decrease in the likelihood of frequent marijuana use among youth after such laws were passed. ""We interpreted our results as consistent with the argument that it is more difficult for teens to obtain marijuana as drug dealers are replaced by licensed dispensaries that require proof of age,"" study author D. Mark Anderson, an associate professor of economics at Montana State University, told PolitiFact Wisconsin in an email.  In some states, recreational sales did not begin until a few years after legalization, so the researchers repeated their analysis based on those dates and got similar results, Anderson said.  A caveat of the analysis is that it uses an average — and when looking at states’ raw data from the survey, results are more mixed.  For example, in Colorado, there have been no significant changes in current marijuana use among high school students since 2005, according to its Healthy Kids Colorado Survey data. In 2013, a year after the state legalized the drug, 19.7% of high school students had used marijuana in the past 30 days; in 2019, 20.6% had.  Alaska’s state survey also reported no significant changes in current youth marijuana use since the drug was legalized in 2015 and sales began in 2016.  And in Oregon, which legalized in 2014, current marjiuana use fell among 8th graders after recreational sales began, but rose among 11th graders, data from the state’s 2017 youth survey found. In the 2019 survey, current marijuana use had risen among 8th graders but fallen among 11th graders. It’s also important to note that the Youth Risk Behavior Survey is just one type of study. Though one set of Washington state data, from the Washington Healthy Youth Survey, found that marijuana use in that state did decrease among the state’s 8th and 10th graders after legalization for recreational purposes in 2012, other studies cited in the JAMA analysis did not reach the same conclusion. For instance, a study using data from the Monitoring the Future survey, which assesses drug and alcohol use among youth across the U.S., found a statistically significant increase in marijuana use among 10th graders in Washington after legalization for recreational use.  Some say the Monitoring the Future data has too much year-to-year volatility to encapsulate marijuana policy changes — but it’s clear that more review will be needed to fully understand the effects of recreational marijuana laws on youth use.  The full effects of marijuana legalization won’t be seen until a generation after national legalization, which still has not happened yet, Jonathan Caulkins, a public policy professor at Carnegie Mellon University and former co-director of RAND’s Drug Policy Research Center, told PolitiFact Illinois about a similar claim from an Illinois state representative.  Agard said youth marijuana use has declined in states that have fully legalized the drug for both medicinal and recreational purposes.  The JAMA analysis she cited did bear that out, although it has its caveats — when looking at individual states’ data, some that legalized the drug years ago have not seen any meaningful change in youth use. Meanwhile, at least one study found the reverse — an increase in use. Experts say it will be many years before what Agard claimed can be said with certainty",Half True,"March 5, 2021"
"“The National Academy of Medicine points to a significant correlation between marijuana and psychosis, schizophrenia, and other psychotic disorders, particularly in teenagers where the risk of developing schizophrenia increases three fold.”","The debate over marijuana has lit up in Wisconsin. Gov. Tony Evers proposed legalizing recreational and medical marijuana in the 2021-23 state budget he unveiled in February. He contends the move would ensure safe products are available to users while providing a new source of revenue for rural schools and programs for marginalized communities.  Wisconsin is in a minority of states that haven’t legalized the drug for medical or recreational use. Republicans are likely to knock down Evers’ proposal after rejecting similar efforts in the previous state budget, though some may be open to medical marijuana. One GOP senator has already made clear why he won’t support legalization. ""The National Academy of Medicine points to a significant correlation between marijuana and psychosis, schizophrenia, and other psychotic disorders, particularly in teenagers where the risk of developing schizophrenia increases three fold,"" state Sen. Chris Kapenga, R-Delafield, said in a Feb. 10, 2021 tweet. In response to Kapenga's claim, state Sen. Melissa Agard tweeted ""Youth usage of marijuana has actually gone down in states that have fully legalized."" We rated Agard's claim Half True. There’s a lot to unpack here. Let’s dig in to Kapenga's claim.  First, a programming note: Marijuana has many purported impacts on health. Kapenga’s claim focused on schizophrenia and psychotic disorders, so that’s what we’ll address here. When asked for evidence to support his claim, the senator cited several articles that examined the relationship between marijuana and psychotic disorders. According to a definition from the National Institute of Mental Health, people experiencing psychosis have lost some contact with reality and can endure hallucinations or delusions.   We’ll start with the research Kapenga referenced in his tweet.  The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine created a committee to examine scientific literature on the health effects of marijuana, both positive and negative. The resulting 2017 report found ""substantial evidence"" that marijuana use can increase the risk of developing schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, with the risk increasing among frequent users. On the other end of the spectrum, researchers indicated that people with schizophrenia or other psychoses and a history of marijuana use may perform better on cognitive learning and memory tasks. The findings in the National Academies report are cited by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And a separate 2019 study in Europe found the odds of a psychotic disorder increased among daily marijuana users, particularly among those using strains with a higher THC content. (THC is the compound that produces a high.) So, Kapenga is right that a correlation exists between marijuana and psychosis — though it’s worth emphasizing that the chances are greater if you use it often.  What about the impact on teenagers? The National Academies report doesn’t directly discuss this aspect of the issue, as Kapenga’s tweet suggests. But he did cite a 2002 study in New Zealand that found ""a tenth of the cannabis users by age 15 in our sample developed schizophreniform disorder by age 26 compared with 3% of the remaining cohort."" That translates to more than 3 times the cases in early marijuana users.  According to another study, 15 and 16 year olds who tried marijuana were more likely to exhibit three or more early symptoms of psychosis, even when reachers controlled for previous behavioral symptoms.  Overall, researchers believe people who smoke marijuana regularly before age 14 have a 2 to 3 times greater risk of developing schizophrenia or a psychotic disorder, said Daniel Yohanna, an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Chicago. That figure aligns with what Kapenga referenced in his tweet.  ""We think that the earlier you smoke and the more you smoke, other factors being controlled for, you have an increased risk of developing schizophrenia,"" Yohanna said.  In a tweet, Kapenga said ""the National Academy of Medicine points to a significant correlation between marijuana and psychosis, schizophrenia, and other psychotic disorders, particularly in teenagers where the risk of developing schizophrenia increases three fold."" There’s extensive research that shows marijuana can lead to psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, particularly if people start using it as children or teenagers. That said, the risk is greatest among frequent users — not those who occasionally light up at a party",True,"March 5, 2021"
The National Institutes of Health “states that regular marijuana use can reduce IQ by 8 points.”,"Only five Republicans supported a House bill that would decriminalize marijuana at the federal level. Congressman David Rouzer was not among them.  The legislation — if passed by the Senate and signed by the president — would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act and eliminate criminal penalties for people who carry or distribute small amounts, CNN reports. The House passed it 228-164 on Dec. 4. Rouzer, who represents southeastern North Carolina, used Twitter to announce his displeasure with the House vote. ""As @HouseDemocrats push marijuana legalization instead of small business COVID-19 relief, remember: the @NIH states that regular marijuana use can reduce IQ by 8 points (which may be irreversible) and impairs memory and learning,"" Rouzer tweeted. First, we should note that the House did pass a bill in October that authorized more financial support for small businesses through the HEROES Act. But here we focus on another part of the claim: Is it true that the National Institutes of Health, a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, says ""regular marijuana use can reduce IQ by 8 points""? The topic is relevant in North Carolina, where a task force appointed by Gov. Roy Cooper recommends decriminalizing marijuana as part of a push for racial justice. Turns out, Rouzer overstates the effect of marijuana on the brain and the NIH’s position.  John Elizandro, Rouzer’s communications director and senior adviser, referred PolitiFact NC to a report compiled by the NIH in July. The 42-page report addresses available information on both the health benefits and potential detriments of marijuana use, including whether it can diminish someone’s IQ. The report specifically mentions a large study in New Zealand, which found that ""persistent marijuana use disorder with frequent use starting in adolescence was associated with a loss of an average of 6 or up to 8 IQ points measured in mid-adulthood. Those who used marijuana heavily as teenagers and quit using as adults did not recover the lost IQ points."" What Rouzer doesn’t mention in his tweet is that the findings applied only to smokers who began using during their adolescence. The report says of the New Zealand study: ""People who only began using marijuana heavily in adulthood did not lose IQ points."" Furthermore, Rouzer ignores language in the NIH report that explicitly states that more research is needed to establish a link between marijuana use and a decline in IQ points. The report summarizes research this way: ""Some studies have also linked marijuana use to declines in IQ, especially when use starts in adolescence and leads to persistent cannabis use disorder into adulthood. However, not all of the studies on the link between marijuana and IQ have reached the same conclusion, and it is difficult to prove that marijuana causes a decline in IQ when there are multiple factors that can influence the results of such studies, such as genetics, family environment, age of first use, frequency of use, having a cannabis use disorder, duration of use, and duration of the study."" The NIH webpage summarizing the report mentions other reasons links are hard to establish. Different strains of marijuana have varying levels of THC, the main active ingredient in cannabis, the NIH says, and the ability to draw definitive conclusions about marijuana’s long-term impact on the brain ""is often limited by the fact that study participants use multiple substances, and there is often limited data about the participants’ health or mental functioning prior to the study."" The report mentions another study, which tracked 4,000 people over a 25-year period. It found that lifetime exposure to marijuana affected memory ""but did not affect other cognitive abilities such as processing speed or executive function."" We contacted the NIH about its view of marijuana’s effect on a user’s IQ levels. Spokeswoman Simona Combi said the NIH believes more research is needed.  ""The New Zealand study mentioned here has limitations that limit our ability to draw definitive conclusions from it,"" Combi said in an email. ""Per the report, not all studies have come to the same conclusion, and more research will be needed to answer definitively whether marijuana use causes long-term IQ losses."" Rouzer said the ""NIH states that regular marijuana use can reduce IQ by 8 points."" The NIH itself has not actually established a link between marijuana use and loss of IQ points — and it says so explicitly in the report Rouzer cited.  Rouzer cherry-picked a stat in a study from another country. He then mischaracterized it as the NIH’s findings and tweeted it without proper context, failing to note that it applied only to people who started marijuana use in their adolescence.

Says there’s “up to 75% reduction in opioid dosage for medical cannabis users.”,"State lawmakers so far have filed more than a dozen bills related to marijuana and medical cannabis for consideration during the 2021 legislative session, coming on the heels of a record-breaking 65 marijuana bills filed last legislative session. Proponents of loosening the state’s marijuana prohibitions hope that momentum generated by legalization efforts around the country could carry into Texas, riding on arguments that legalization would be a boon for the economy and an important pillar of criminal justice reform. Rep. Lyle Larson, R-San Antonio, made a different case for medical marijuana when he filed House Joint Resolution 28. In an announcement on Twitter, Larson said the bill would allow voters to decide ""whether Texas physicians should be allowed to prescribe medical cannabis for a variety of illnesses plaguing Texans."" If approved by more than two-thirds of both legislative chambers, a proposal would be added to the November 2021 ballot that would amend the state constitution to legalize the possession, cultivation and sale of cannabis strictly for medical use. Larson cited one statistic to justify his bill: ""Studies have shown up to 75% reduction in opioid dosage for medical cannabis users"" The intersection of medical cannabis and opioid use as treatments for chronic pain is an emerging field of research as more states loosen regulations on medical and recreational use of marijuana. But does science show that cannabis has as great an impact on opioid dosage as Larson claims? Larson’s aides pointed to a report published over the summer by researchers at the University of Arizona that assessed the effectiveness of medical cannabis in reducing opioid dosage for the treatment of chronic pain in non-cancer patients. The analysis looked at nine separate studies involving a total of 7,222 participants across the U.S., Canada and Australia that ""found a much higher reduction in opioid dosage, reduced emergency room visits, and hospital admissions for chronic non-cancer pain by (medical cannabis) users, compared to people with no additional use of"" medical cannabis. Those studies confirm Larson’s assertion: There was a 64% to 75% reduction in opioid dosage when patients supplemented their chronic pain treatments with medical cannabis, and 32% to 59% of cannabis users reported a complete end to opioid use. But University of Arizona researchers note several caveats to these findings. There has generally been ""a dearth of empirical studies"" about the use of cannabis versus opioids in chronic pain treatments. In order to include a large sample size, the researchers ""relaxed inclusion criteria"" in their analysis to allow for the inclusion of observational studies, which are not systematic enough to be considered empirical evidence. For instance, in each of the nine studies, patients were self-reporting their reduction of opioid dosage, implying a degree of uncertainty in the findings. And in several of the studies, patients didn’t report the amount of cannabis used to achieve a reduction of opioid dosage. Furthermore, researchers noted how cannabis can slow a person’s metabolism, thereby causing an opioid medication to absorb into their bloodstream more slowly. This effect can give a patient the impression that their opioid dosage may need to be increased. While studies suggest that cannabis could be used to reduce opioid dosages when treating chronic pain, researchers suggest the findings be interpreted with caution due to limitations in the evidence. The intent of the study is to suggest to the wider medical field that more systematic tests should be conducted, said Dr. Babasola Okusanya of the University of Arizona, who was involved in the study, and the severity of the opioid epidemic should heighten the urgency of these tests. ""Given the current opioid epidemic in the USA and medical cannabis’s recognized analgesic properties, (medical cannabis) could serve as a viable option to achieve opioid dosage reduction in managing non-cancer chronic pain,"" researchers wrote. ""Unfortunately, the evidence from this review cannot be relied upon to promote (medical cannabis) as an adjunct to opioids in treating non-cancer chronic pain."" It would be premature to base legislation on this study’s findings, Okusanya said. ""Although some evidence points to the potential use of medical cannabis for opioid dose reduction in people with non-cancer chronic pain, it is not sufficient to support a legislative bill to make medical cannabis available to people with non-cancer chronic pain,"" he said. While the effects of cannabis on decreasing opioid usage may be inconclusive, other studies have shown that increasing access to marijuana can lead to a reduction in opioid-related deaths. Last year, researchers found that the legalization of recreational marijuana reduced annual opioid mortality between 20% and 35%. ""Recreational marijuana laws affect a much larger population than medical marijuana laws, yet we know relatively little about their effects,"" said Nathan Chan of University of Massachusetts Amherst, who co-authored the study. ""Focusing on the recent wave of recreational marijuana laws in the U.S., we find that opioid mortality rates drop when recreational marijuana becomes widely available via dispensaries."" The Legislature first cracked open the door to medical cannabis in 2015 by creating the Texas Compassionate Use Program. The program limited medical cannabis to low levels of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, and could only be used in the treatment of intractable epilepsy. In 2019, the Legislature expanded the program to allow physicians to prescribe medical cannabis to treat several other conditions, including all types of epilepsy, terminal cancer, autism, multiple sclerosis and other neuro-degenerative disorders. Other conditions that medical cannabis advocates pushed for that did not get included in the 2019 expansion include chronic pain and post traumatic stress disorder. During the 2021 session, advocates say they will push to include these conditions under the program and will seek to eliminate restrictions on THC levels in medical cannabis. Currently, state law caps THC in medical cannabis at 0.5% — a level that advocates say is arbitrary. ""Many patients benefit from THC, and it's our position that doctors should be the ones who are making the decision about dosing rather than lawmakers,"" said Heather Fazio, director of the Marijuana Policy Project. ""We trust doctors with far more dangerous drugs."" Larson’s legislative director Caroline Cone echoed that argument. ""Currently, (medical professionals) can't prescribe it, but they can prescribe opioids which have proven to be much more addictive and damaging long term,"" Cone said. ""Anxiety and pain management for veterans and elderly folks in lieu of opioids was Rep. Larson's motivation to file the legislation."" Larson filed legislation earlier this month aimed at expanding the use of medical cannabis by giving physicians the authority to prescribe cannabis based on their own expertise. In a tweet, Larson justified his bill by saying that medical cannabis can help chronic pain patients reduce opioid dosage by up to 75%. Preliminary studies suggest a correlation between medical cannabis usage and a reduction in opioid dosage, but researchers note the results are inconclusive and more rigorous testing should be done to know the full effects of medical cannabis on opioid dosage",Mostly True,"November 20, 2020"

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The website updated its headline with more accurate information following the publication of this fact-check. A preliminary study supported researchers’ theory that certain cannabis extracts could be used as part of a treatment to prevent coronavirus infections. But the study has not been peer reviewed and no testing has yet been done on humans. ""Yes, this is an overstatement,"" Igor Kovalchuk, the lead researcher of the study, told PolitiFact about the headline. Cannabis and marijuana are not exactly the same. Cannabis refers to all products derived from the plant Cannabis sativa. The cannabis plant contains about 540 chemical substances. Marijuana refers to parts of, or products from, the plant Cannabis sativa that contain substantial amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC is the substance that’s primarily responsible for the effects of marijuana on a person’s mental state.  The website that published the article is part of Los Angeles-based Merry Jane, which describes itself as a ""multi-media and lifestyle company that’s creating the new mainstream culture by connecting cannabis and pop culture."" The article, however, is more nuanced than its headline. The article says that based on the study, ""cannabis extracts could work as an ‘adjunct therapy’ in new medical products that could reduce the chances of someone getting COVID-19.""  In other words, despite the headline on the article, the study isn’t saying cannabis alone could prevent infection.  The study referred to in the article was done by six researchers from universities of Lethbridge and Calgary, both in Canada. The researchers are also affiliated with two startup companies that do medical cannabis and disease research. Their study was published April 19 in Preprints, which describes itself as a platform for ""early versions of research outputs"" that are not peer-reviewed.  So, this is a preliminary research paper. According to the study, all cannabis plants for the study were grown in a licensed facility at the University of Lethbridge to obtain the extracts, which were then applied to artificial human 3D tissue models of oral, airway and intestinal tissues. ""Application was intended to model medical delivery, such as local mouthwash applications, encapsulated extracts and dosed oils, and inhalers or nebulizers, and therefore these results cannot be extrapolated to the effects of cannabis smoking,"" the study said. The extracts, ""pending further investigation, may become a useful and safe addition to the treatment of COVID-19 as an adjunct therapy,"" the study concluded.  These extracts also ""can be used to develop easy-to-use preventative treatments in the form of mouthwash and throat gargle products for both clinical and at-home use. Such products ought to be tested for their potential to decrease viral entry via the oral mucosa. Given the current dire and rapidly evolving epidemiological situation, every possible therapeutic opportunity and avenue must be considered."" In short, the researchers theorize that cannabis extracts could interfere with the virus’ process of infection in cells — but this is based on laboratory testing on specially engineered tissue to fully mimic human organs, not testing on humans. ""Clinical trial (on humans) is a must,"" to determine whether extracts could help prevent COVID-19, Kovalchuk said. Virologist Angela Rasmussen, a research scientist at Columbia University, told PolitiFact ""it may be worth more study, but in my opinion this is a very long way from being a legitimate candidate for therapeutics or preventative products like mouthwash."" The headline of an article shared on Facebook said: ""Cannabis may stop coronavirus from infecting people, study finds."" The study found, based on lab testing, that cannabis extracts could be part of a treatment that dramatically reduces the chances of being infected by COVID-10.  But the study is preliminary, has not been peer reviewed and tests on humans would need to be done to determine if the extracts could be part of a treatment that blocks the coronavirus, the study’s lead author said.  The headline contains only an element of truth",Mostly False,"May 18, 2020"
An old image shows a drug store with a marijuana leaf sign.,"A viral social media post shows an old, black-and-white photograph of a drug store with a marijuana leaf painted above its entrance.

Multiple comments on the page congratulate the poster on the photo manipulation, and one commenter asks for a link to the original photograph, to which the poster replies that they can’t find it anymore. The manipulated image also appears on meme websites, including a page of altered mashup images. However, the notion that marijuana was used for medicinal purposes in the 1800s isn’t wrong. According to PBS, the U.S.-marijuana relationship dates back to the Colonial Era, and it wasn’t until the 1930s that the government started to criminalize the drug: ""American production of hemp was encouraged by the government in the 17th century for the production of rope, sails, and clothing. (Marijuana is the mixture of dried, shredded flowers and leaves that comes from the hemp plant.) Domestic production flourished until after the Civil War, when imports and other domestic materials replaced hemp for many purposes. In the late 19th century, marijuana became a popular ingredient in many medicinal products and was sold openly in public pharmacies.""

"""If folks are vaping a legal medical cannabis product that comes from any of the New York state operators, they will not have to worry about the negative impacts on their lungs.""","Vaping-related illnesses have vexed public health officials and prompted state policymakers to consider banning e-cigarettes. The Centers for Disease Control cited 1,888 reports  of lung injuries associated with e-cigarettes or vaping and 37 deaths as of Oct. 29.  Those who vape use an electronic cigarette product, such as a vape pen or e-hookah, to heat a liquid to produce an aerosol that they inhale into their lungs. The liquid can contain nicotine, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabinoid oils (CBD)  and other substances and additives. Most electronic cigarette products contain a battery to heat the liquid. In New York, approved providers offer medical marijuana in several forms, including vape pens and cartridges, and offer THC and CBD in different concentrations, according to a 2018 report from the state Department of Health.   In an interview on WBEN radio on Oct. 9, Assembly Majority Leader Crystal Peoples-Stokes assured listeners that vaping medical marijuana from an approved dispensary is safe.  ""If folks are vaping a legal medical cannabis product that comes from any of the New York state operators, they will not have to worry about the negative impacts on their lungs,"" Peoples-Stokes said.  But is that true?  We reached out to Peoples-Stokes’ spokesman, Kevin Jolly, who said that the Majority Leader was following guidance from the state Department of Health.  Jolly said the public health concern stems from recent cases of lung injuries from vaping products purchased informally on the street. Peoples-Stokes does not approve of vaping, he said. The state Department of Health, however, cautions users of state-approved medical marijuana vape products, even though it has no reports of problems with them.  On Sept. 7, Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker released a statement urging ""New Yorkers to stop using vape products while the investigation into the definitive cause of reported vaping-associated illnesses nationwide can be better determined.""  That statement was also posted on the department’s web page for medical marijuana users.  Medical marijuana products are ""rigorously tested for contaminants, pesticides and concentration of cannabinoids,"" the department advised, but it warned that ""out of an abundance of caution, we are also urging patients in the medical marijuana program to consult with their health care providers on potential alternatives to vaping products while the investigation continues.""   There are reasons Peoples-Stokes declared regulated medical marijuana safe for New Yorkers to use.  An earlier notice from the state Department of Health, dated Sept. 5, 2019, asked everyone except medical marijuana users to consider not using any vape products. And on Sept. 9, two days after the department cautioned medical marijuana users to consider alternatives to vaping, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a news conference about vaping illnesses that ""this does not include the medical marijuana products. Those are regulated, and those are safe.""  At the federal level, the CDC is also investigating the cause of the lung injuries and has  recommended that no one use e-cigarette or vaping products that contain THC, according to Cassie Brailer, press officer for lung injury response at the CDC. The agency knows that THC is present in most of the samples that have been tested and that most lung injury patients report using products that contain THC, Brailer said. National and state findings ""suggest products containing THC, particularly those obtained off the street or from other informal sources,"" are linked to most of the cases, Brailer said.  ""Since the specific cause or causes of lung injury are not yet known, the only way to assure that you are not at risk while the investigation continues is to consider refraining from use of all e-cigarette and vaping products,"" Brailer said.   In interviews with four researchers who study public health or cannabis use, we found mixed opinions on whether vaping even a regulated substance such a medical marijuana can have a negative impact on a patient’s lungs. Two experts said that it is too early to tell. One said that vaping any substance can be harmful. And one said that those vaping regulated medical marijuana in New York state should not fear the marijuana but said there are unknowns about the vaping device itself.     Mitch Earleywine, a psychology professor at the University at Albany who studies marijuana policy and advocates for reform of cannabis laws, said that flavor-free vape liquids, such as those used in the medical marijuana program in New York, remain under-investigated. He has done research on the vaporizer, which he said appears safe, but there is no long-term data on the vape oil.  Ana Maria Rule, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, agreed there is not enough data to declare vaping medical marijuana ""safe.""    Another expert, Ilias Kavouras, a professor at the City University of New York Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy, said that lung damage can be caused by medical marijuana and vaping, including those formed during the process of smoking marijuana or vaping.  ""There is evidence in the scientific literature that toxic and carcinogenic species are formed during vaping,"" Kavouras said. A professor of public health at Syracuse University offered a different opinion.  Dessa Bergen-Cico, who is coordinator of addiction studies programs at Falk College at SU, said that people who purchase medical marijuana vape cartridges from registered state dispensaries ""should not have problems with product safety because the products are highly regulated and tested.""  However, ""it is still unknown if there is something in the vaping devices that is a catalyst for the lung injuries,"" Bergen-Cico said.  Peoples-Stokes said that people who used medical marijuana obtained from approved operators in New York shouldn’t worry about the negative impact on their lungs.  While state and federal public health officials have not found a link between medical marijuana from regulated operators and lung injury cases, they recommend caution when it comes to vaping. The Centers for Disease Control recommends people do not use e-cigarette or vaping products that contain THC and consider refraining from using all e-cigarette and vaping products. The state is telling people to stop using vape products until the cause of the lung illnesses are known, and is urging medical marijuana patients to consider alternatives to vaping while its investigation is underway.   Public health researchers have found that it’s unclear whether vaping is safe or not, even if the user is vaping a regulated substance such as medical marijuana",Mostly False,"November 2, 2019"
"""Hemp has 25,000-35,000 known usages. That means it is going to be something that will replace plastics, and styrofoam and concrete.""","Hemp has been used inside a BMW electric car, as fiber in jeans and in the walls of a Tarpon Springs, home. Now Florida’s lone statewide elected Democrat, Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, will oversee a new state industrial hemp program. Fried, a former lobbyist for the marijuana industry, says that hemp has a massive number of uses and will replace some common materials. ""What most people don’t understand is that hemp has 25,000-35,000 known usages,"" she said at a Florida Democratic Party conference in Orlando. ""That means it is going to be something that is going to replace plastics, and styrofoam and concrete.""  That’s a giant heap of hemp. But is Fried’s claim accurate? While hemp and marijuana are from the same species of plant, hemp is nonpsychoactive and is used for a variety of products. Industry-friendly legislation has helped to grow the hemp market in recent years. But don’t expect it to replace plastics or concrete anytime soon. Vast research and development — and money — is needed before widespread utilization. ""Industrial hemp products offer an alternative to materials like plastic and concrete in certain applications, but will never be able to fully replace them due to differences in the physical and chemical characteristics of the materials,"" said Tai Olson, who works for US Heritage Group, which works with suppliers for hempcrete projects.  Fried’s claim about the number of uses for hemp comes from a magazine story published 80 years ago. In 1938, Popular Mechanics magazine declared hemp the new ""billion dollar crop.""  ""Hemp is the standard fiber of the world. It has great tensile strength and durability. It is used to produce more than 5,000 textile products, ranging from rope to fine laces, and the wood ‘hurdes’ remaining after the fiber has been removed contains more than 77% cellulose, and can be used to produce more than 25,000 products, ranging from dynamite to cellophane."" The magazine story, however, did not account for government regulation that stymied hemp development. In 1937, Congress passed a law, which required hemp farmers to register and pay a tax. But the 25,000-uses statistic lived on, even earning a mention in a 2018 Congressional Research Service report.  Fried’s spokesman noted that report as well as other citations by news outlets including the Tampa Bay Times, Florida government and academic works. (PolitiFact Missouri also cited the figure, we found.)  We sent Fried’s citations to four academic experts on hemp, and none was swayed. ""Just because a number is repeated over and over does not make it true,"" agriculture scientist Jennifer Gilbert Jenkins told us. Gilbert Jenkins is a professor at the State University of New York at Morrisville. Hemp has multiple uses within agriculture, textiles, recycling, automotive, furniture, food and beverages, paper, construction materials, and personal care.  A few experts in hemp told us the math behind 25,000 uses (and especially 35,000) is empty.  ""Of course it’s misleading, since defining what a ‘use’ is is arbitrary, and most uses would be economically insignificant,"" said Ernest Small, a research scientist in Canada. ""But the same could be said about numerous things, so it’s not exactly untruthful. With some imagination, I think you could find 25,000 uses for a car, or for many common things."" Back to the source, Popular Mechanics. Jared W. Nelson, a mechanical engineer at SUNY New Paltz, told us he thinks the reported number of uses does not specifically refer to hemp, but instead refers to cellulose. Dynamite and cellophane are derived from cellulose. While hemp could provide sugars through the enzymatic breakdown of cellulose, it’s a lot easier and cheaper to get those sugars from corn starch or sugar cane, said Cornell professor Lawrence B. Smart. ""The 25,000 products is a great number, but please put it in context,"" Smart said. ""Since we get most of our paper products from eucalyptus and lumber products from pine, how many products can you make from eucalyptus and pine?""  What matters most, said Gilbert Jenkins, is ""for the first time in a generation we are able to innovate around this versatile crop."" The 2018 farm bill legalized industrial use of hemp and removed it from the federal list of controlled substances, opening up the market to new products. According to Vote Hemp,  the number of acres of grown hemp tripled between 2017 and 2018, and hemp-based product sales have also climbed. Fried’s spokesman Franco Ripple pointed to examples of hemp being used in hempcrete to build homes, composites to build products like cars, and hemp-based packaging and plastic alternatives. Hemp-based products should increasingly replace specific uses of Styrofoam, plastic, and concrete, he added. ""Her forward-looking statements on the future of hemp and potential uses are intended to inspire the industry’s development,"" he said, citing predictions about the future growth of hemp.  But there are challenges to using hemp in the United States. For example, Gilbert Jenkins is partnering with the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York to make hemp jeans.   ""We are in the process of sending a bale of hemp fiber to Poland to be processed into yarn because that capability does not exist in the United States currently,"" she said. ""Our textile industry is set up to work with cotton short fibers, not long hemp fibers."" As for Ripple’s examples, they don’t represent the majority of current hemp use. About 80 percent of hemp grown in the United States is for hemp extracts including cannabidiol, or CBD, said Eric Steenstra, Vote Hemp’s president.  Experts also told us that hempcrete is intended to replace other components within a wall, such as sheetrock, and not the concrete itself. Also, hemp won’t replace plastics. Hemp fibers can be used to strengthen plastics and other composite materials. Hemp oil can replace the petroleum oil raw material for the plastic, which ""is still plastic with all of its downsides,"" said Gilbert Jenkins. Hemp has scarcely penetrated the building and plastic replacement markets, Small said. ""The future seems limited, albeit not impossible."" Fried said, ""Hemp has 25,000-35,000 known usages. That means it is going to be something that is going to replace plastics, and styrofoam and concrete.""  The number comes from a Popular Mechanics article in 1938 about the number of potential products that creates an overly optimistic picture of the number of uses. Just because a use exists does not mean that it is commonly available. Most hemp grown now is for CBD. Fried said that hemp products will ""replace"" such common materials as plastics and concrete, but we found no evidence that hemp has the physical properties to truly replace these materials. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression",Mostly False,"October 22, 2019"
"""A study was done, a post-mortem, so a retrospective study done, looking at autopsies and drug levels, what drugs were in the blood of veterans that committed suicide, and 70 percent had THC.""","Texas lawmakers this year voted to broaden the state’s medical marijuana program to include more qualifying conditions than just intractable epilepsy. Under the bill, which was signed into law, patients with several more conditions, including terminal cancers, autism and multiple sclerosis, will now be eligible to participate in the program. During a debate in the Senate over the proposal, state Sen. Donna Campbell, R-New Braunfels, argued against including post-traumatic stress disorder in the bill. The disorder was ultimately not included in the bill that passed. ""A study was done, a post-mortem, so a retrospective study done, looking at autopsies and drug levels, what drugs were in the blood of veterans that committed suicide, and 70 percent had THC,"" Campbell said. We decided to take a look at Campbell’s claim to see if a study of this nature existed and whether there’s a connection between veterans, marijuana use and suicide. No signs of Campbell’s study Campbell’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment. We searched far and wide but could not find a study with results matching those described by Campbell.  Several experts and advocates contacted for this piece said they were unaware of a study that reflected the findings Campbell described. Several studies examine the relationship between cannabis use and suicidal thoughts. Others have cross-referenced registry data on deaths attributed to suicide with the timing of the legalization of medical marijuana in the states where the suicides took place. Dr. Arpana Agrawal, professor of psychiatry at the Washington University School of Medicine who authored a study on cannabis and suicidal thoughts and behavior, said these types of studies have produced mixed results.  In her study, which enlisted identical twins, one of whom used cannabis more frequently and the other who used it lightly or not at all did not use it all or lightly, found that the twins that used cannabis more often were more likely to report suicidal thoughts and depression. While the data suggests that the association is unrelated to shared genetics and early environment, it does not necessarily mean that the effects of cannabis were the cause, she said. It could have been another risk factor, such as trauma. A 2016 study by CDC scientists that used data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that the rate of suicidal thinking was more than nine times higher for veterans with drug problems than those without, with the majority involving marijuana abuse. The study noted, however, that other factors, such as coping with post-traumatic stress, managing chronic pain conditions related to war injuries, or adjusting to civilian life, could confound the association between the two.  What makes this subject so hard to study? Agrawal said one reason is that suicide is such a complex behavior with many aspects — from contemplation, to attempts (with or without a plan) to actual deaths. ""(Researchers) might have asked only of individuals who report experiencing depression, although suicidal thoughts and behaviors are not just limited to depression,"" Agrawal said. ""In studies of completed suicide, little may be known about the substance use history over and above a toxicology report."" Cannabis use and veterans Research also is lacking on cannabis use and suicide among veterans specifically. A study conducted by Safe States Alliance, an injury and violence prevention national nonprofit, in March 2018 used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Violent Death Reporting System to analyze U.S. veteran and armed forces deaths from suicide. The group’s study found that 9 percent of victims had marijuana in their system. It did not show whether a victim had more than one substance in their system. Sharon Gilmartin, deputy director of Safe States Alliance, said she wasn’t aware of a statistic like the one Campbell cited. Gilmartin also cautioned against interpreting her organization’s studies or others that include toxicology data as definitively linking marijuana to suicide because of the nature of THC. ""It’s not quite like alcohol where you have a certain BAC (blood alcohol content), and that directly links to impairment, then it goes away and you’re kind of back to sobriety more or less,"" Gilmartin said. ""When you think about THC, it’s a different dose-response relationship, and it also has a different latency period, so it stays in your blood long after you’re impaired."" There are also limitations to what such data can tell us, Agrawal said, because of that age-old statistical standard that ""correlation does not imply causation."" ""While such studies show a correlation, it is difficult to know from data at one time point whether cannabis use is a causal factor,"" Agrawal said. ""Veterans are more likely to report cannabis use and are also at risk for suicide. But that doesn't answer the question as to how the two are related."" For example, she said, people who are vulnerable to suicide might use cannabis more often to self-medicate; or people who use cannabis more heavily may report more suicidal thoughts; or alternatively, some other factor might influence the use of both cannabis and risk for suicide, such as trauma exposure. Our ruling Campbell suggested that cannabis plays a role in suicide among veterans, claiming that a study showed 70 percent of veterans who committed suicide had THC in their body. But the study Campbell cited doesn’t seem to exist. Some research does exist on this topic, but experts questioned the validity of drawing a conclusion about the connection between marijuana use and suicide generally — let alone among veterans",False Pants on Fire,"July 15, 2019"
"""Nearly every state that has legalized (marijuana) has also legislated that you lose your right to own a gun if you are prescribed, or buy it recreationally.""","People who support legalizing marijuana should proceed with caution, claims a recent Facebook post about communities that are decriminalizing the drug for medical and recreational use.  ""Nearly every state that has legalized it has also legislated that you lose your right to own a gun if you are prescribed it, or buy it recreationally,"" the May 14 post says. ""Pot legalization is turning out to be a back-door way for the government to get you to voluntarily give up your gun rights."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  A federal law that pre-dates legalization does prohibit users of controlled substances — including marijuana — from possessing firearms. But we found no evidence that states have legalized marijuana and then enacted their own laws to ban cannabis users from owning a gun. Dozens of states have legalized marijuana and we reached out to some of them to ask about the post. No one could corroborate the Facebook post’s claim.  Alex Traverso, a spokesman for the Bureau of Cannabis Control in California, told us he’s never even heard such a claim, nor seen anything about it in the state’s regulations.  Brian Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board, said there’s ""no link between purchasing recreational or medical marijuana and owning a gun.""  ""The product is not traced post-retail sale so there is no way of even linking the two,"" he said. Madeline Kane with the Oregon Liquor Control Commission said the agency doesn’t regulate firearms. But, she said, ""it is our understanding that what you have described may be related to federal policy."" Because marijuana is still illegal under federal law, said Tara Dunn, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, it’s still classified as a controlled substance. People who apply for a firearm must complete a federal form that asks in part about unlawful marijuana use.  ""Warning,"" the form says under a question about the unlawful use of marijuana or other substances. ""The use or possession of marijuana remains unlawful under federal law regardless of whether it has been legalized or decriminalized for medicinal or recreational purposes in the state where you reside.""  That means that marijuana users may be rejected from purchasing a firearm, Dunn said.  Next, we turned to some marijuana experts to help us parse the federal and state laws. Matt Simon, the New England political director with Marijuana Policy Project, which advocates for marijuana policy reforms, including decriminalizing marijuana use, said the Facebook claim ""is absolutely false.""  ""I’m not aware of any state medical cannabis law or adult use legalization law that explicitly prohibits cannabis users from owning firearms,"" he said.  However, he said, under federal law it has long been considered illegal for a user of a controlled substance — including marijuana — to possess a firearm. Those are policies from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), though, not state law.  In some cases, Simon said, local law enforcement has enforced the federal prohibition. While the Department of Health and Human Services in New Hampshire is forbidden by state law from sharing information from its therapeutic cannabis patient registry with federal agencies, Hawaii lets local police access its medical cannabis registry and gun owner registry.  Simon pointed to a 2017 Miami Herald story that reported the Honolulu Police Department sent letters to all medical cannabis patients who were also registered gun owners and told them they had 30 days to surrender their firearms. After pushback, Simon said, the police department said it wouldn’t enforce the policy.   Some states have moved to protect the gun rights of medical marijuana users. In Oklahoma, for example, the governor signed a bill on April 15 that says state and local agencies can’t deny gun rights to people because they use medical marijuana. Earlier this year U.S. Rep. Alex Mooney, a Republican from West Virginia, filed a bill that would amend federal law so that medicinal marijuana users wouldn’t be disqualified from purchasing a gun. (No action has been taken since it was introduced in the House on April 3.) Our ruling The Facebook post says that nearly every state that has legalized marijuana has also legislated that people who use cannabis lose their right to own a gun.  We didn’t find evidence to support this claim.  While federal law prohibits marijuana users from owning a firearm, states are not legalizing cannabis and then passing legislation that requires marijuana users to forfeit their gun rights",False,"July 9, 2019"
"""In states that have legalized (recreational marijuana), you see steady decreases in youth use if you do it right.""","Among the issues taking center stage in Springfield as lawmakers enter the final stretch of the legislative session is whether Illinois should join a growing number of states in lifting a prohibition on recreational marijuana. While the legislation under consideration would bar legal sales to those under 21, critics have raised concerns that the easier access could still lead to greater use among teens. One Democratic lawmaker who spoke in support of the plan when it was unveiled recently by Gov. J.B. Pritzker was state Rep. Kelly Cassidy, a Chicago Democrat. ""Cannabis should be sold in venues that are highly regulated, taking the pot market out of the shadows,"" Cassidy said. ""In states that have legalized, you see steady decreases in youth use if you do it right."" PolitiFact in recent years has assessed changes in pot use among youth while investigating claims about how legalization has affected citizens in Colorado, which became the first state in the nation to greenlight retail sales in 2014 after voters approved cannabis for adult recreational use by ballot measure in 2012. Since 2014, the data show no statistically significant uptick in pot usage among teens so legalization hardly leads to the reefer madness some critics feared. But the numbers available for Colorado and other states that have lifted bans for adults also don’t reveal the clear pattern of decline in youth pot use that Cassidy described. If lawmakers approve the plan, Illinois could become the 11th state to allow adults to use cannabis recreationally and the second in the Midwest, after Michigan, where voters in November approved a measure legalizing the drug. So far, retail sales are up and running in seven of those states, including three in just the last three years. That makes it harder to come by comprehensive statistics. Cassidy sent us an email promising an aide would ""share the studies out of Colorado,"" but nothing arrived from the lawmaker’s office as of our deadline. She also didn’t explain what she meant by ""do it right."" Colorado and Washington were the first states to legalize retail marijuana sales, so they have the longest track records to study. In Colorado, a 2018 report by the state Department of Public Safety's Division of Justice reviewed data from the Healthy Kids Colorado Survey, which includes answers to various health questions asked of more than 40,000 middle and high school students every other year. The survey is conducted by the state’s Department of Public Health & Environment. Results from the survey show 19.7% of Colorado high schoolers reported using marijuana within the past month in 2013, the year before the first retail marijuana store opened. In 2015, that figure rose slightly, but experts told PolitiFact in 2016 that increase was not statistically significant. In 2017, the rate dipped to 19.4%, slightly lower than it had been in previous surveys dating back to least 2005. But the Colorado report includes a major disclaimer. It states upfront that the majority of data related to marijuana legalization is ""baseline and preliminary,"" making it ""difficult to draw conclusions about the potential effects of marijuana legalization and commercialization on public safety, public health, or youth outcomes"" due to the lack of historical data. Jonathan Caulkins, a public policy professor at Carnegie Mellon University and former co-director of RAND’s Drug Policy Research Center, echoed that warning to PolitiFact Illinois. ""The full effects of cannabis legalization won’t be seen for a generation after national legalization, which has not even happened yet,"" he wrote in an email. As for preliminary state results? Caulkins said that making recreational marijuana legal for adults has done little to affect use by youth — in large part because cannabis was already relatively easy for minors to obtain in those states. Indeed, material included in the Colorado survey characterizes as ""relatively unchanged"" the slight variations in teen marijuana use since legalization. Voters in Washington also approved recreational cannabis in late 2012, and retail sales of the drug there began in 2014, six months after Colorado. The state conducts a biennial youth health survey similar to Colorado’s, which breaks its data down by grades. Its results show some small declines but suggest little has changed there either, with decreases of 1% between 2014 and 2016 among 8th and 10th graders who said they currently used pot, followed by 1% increases for both grades in 2018. For 12th graders, rates fell by 1% the year after retail sales began and have remained at that level, which is in line with pre-legalization rates. ""The findings with respect to youth are generally mixed and depend critically on what measures of youth use one wants to focus on,"" said Rosalie Pacula, a senior economist with RAND and current co-director of the Drug Policy Research Center who analyzed survey data for Washington and Colorado in several recent reports. She explained in an email to us that studies of states where adult use is legal generally show either no effect or some decline in past-year or 30-day use rates among youth, depending on the survey data used. But results for more frequent and risky use are ""a bit more mixed,"" she said, with some showing an uptick. Changes in the other five states where retail sales are underway are even more difficult to evaluate than Colorado or Washington. Alaska’s state survey reported no statistically significant changes since recreational cannabis was approved for adults in 2014 and hit the market in 2016. Results in Oregon, which followed a similar timeline, were mixed. And it’s too soon to assess results out of Nevada, California and Massachusetts, which each repealed bans in late 2016 but only began allowing sales within the last two years. Cassidy said, ""In states that have legalized, you see steady decreases in youth use if you do it right."" She did not provide any proof to back up her statement. Of the 10 states that allow adults to use cannabis recreationally, only four have permitted retail sales long enough to provide enough data points for a preliminary comparison. While state survey data show no spike in current marijuana use among teens, they also fall short of suggesting the downward trajectory Cassidy described",Mostly False,"May 12, 2019"

But patients should not be discriminated against who need a kidney or some other transplant simply because, again, they are exercising a legal medical option."" Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill to allow smoking medical marijuana, reversing the smoking ban the Legislature implemented in 2017 following the passage of a constitutional amendment to allow medical marijuana in 2016. READ MORE: All of our fact-checks on marijuana  Farmer hopes to get language included in a separate bill to protect those awaiting organs who use medical marijuana. So how often do transplant centers keep patients off transplant lists or remove them from lists due to medical marijuana? We found that it happens, but we can’t tell you how often due to a lack of national data. We found some anecdotal accounts in news reports, and learned it has prompted at least a half dozen states to pass laws to help such patients. ""I am aware that such rejections have been issues in California, Maine and Massachusetts,"" Harvard’s Dr. Jordan Tishler, an expert in the field of medical cannabis therapeutics, told PolitiFact. Another wrinkle: A patient could be rejected for an organ based on more than one factor, and whether marijuana was a reason can depend on the organ, or amount of marijuana use. Here’s what we found. There is no national policy on whether medical marijuana users are banned from organ transplant lists, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, the organization that manages the nation’s organ transplant system under contract with the federal government. It’s up to the approximately 250 transplant centers to determine such rules. ""The rules vary from center to center and from organ to organ,"" said Arthur Caplan, founding head of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU School of Medicine. ""I would not say the majority of centers exclude people for marijuana use, but some do."" One recent survey provides some evidence that patients are rejected. The 2016 survey of members of the American Society of Transplantation, including transplant physicians and support staff, drew about 225 responses (or 8 percent of the membership). Because the responses were anonymous, it is unknown how many of the transplant centers were included in the results. Approximately 64 respondents said their centers rejected all candidates irrespective of the organ if they used marijuana, while 117 said the center’s policy varied depending upon the organ. The remainder were unknown or didn’t respond. To learn more, we interviewed spokespersons for five Florida transplant centers — Jackson Memorial Health in Miami, Tampa General Hospital, Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Cleveland Clinic Weston and University of Florida Health — as well as the University of California San Francisco. They generally told us that transplant centers take marijuana use into account, including if the person excessively uses marijuana. But the decisions to evaluate applicants based on marijuana use are made on a case-by-case basis — and their hospitals don’t have a blanket ban on marijuana. Jackson Health System’s Miami Transplant Institute, which performed the country’s second-largest number of transplants in 2018, described the evaluation process as complex. ""A multidisciplinary team evaluates a patient’s eligibility to be listed for a transplant based on medical and surgical grounds, insurance, and psychosocial criteria,"" spokeswoman Tania Leets said. ""We do not turn away patients who use medical marijuana; however, we do take this into consideration during their evaluation for transplantation."" A Tampa General Hospital spokesman told us that the lung program would be the only program to not list a patient using marijuana either legal or illegal but only if that patient is inhaling the drug. (Doctors generally may suggest that certain patients who use medical marijuana avoid smoking it and ingest it in edible or oil form.) The hospital has not removed any patients from its waitlist due to medical marijuana usage. The University of California San Francisco transplant center does not remove or deny someone on the transplant list solely on marijuana use. However, if use of marijuana or other substances impair the patient’s ability to function and reliably follow medical prescriptions for dialysis and medication use, that could jeopardize a patient being placed on the transplant list. Farmer said, ""Some patients who are on transplant lists for kidney or other organs are being dropped from the list simply because they are shown as a licensed card holder"" for medical marijuana. We found a scarcity of national information to show how often someone is kept off a transplant list as a result of marijuana use. But what we did find — including anecdotal reports from several states and some survey data — indicates that some patients have been rejected from transplant lists because of their cardholder status, as Farmer said. It's important to know that every transplant center sets its own rules",Mostly True,"March 27, 2019"
"After legalizing marijuana in Colorado, ""we haven't seen a spike in consumption.""","  Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democratic candidate for president, got some laughs during a CNN town hall when he discussed the experience of overseeing the legalization of recreational marijuana in his state. Marijuana officially became legal in Colorado in December 2012, but legal adult sales did not begin until Jan. 1, 2014. At that point, it took the better part of a year for localities around the state to fully come online and get businesses licensed. Hickenlooper, who initially opposed legal weed, grew to accept it. During the town hall, a participant asked him for his reflections on this evolution. Here’s what Hickenlooper said: ""As my mother would say, you couldn't control what things would come in your path, what bad things life might throw at you. And in the end, we were very concerned about this. And I was opposed to it originally. No other government had ever legalized marijuana. Even Amsterdam just decriminalized it. We were worried about teenage consumption going up, when kids' brains are rapidly growing, what it could do. We were worried about the risks of, you know, more people driving while high. And partly, it's no fun to be in conflict with the federal government.  ""But I believe that states are the laboratories of democracy, as Justice Brandeis said so famously, and that we would give it our best shot. And I have to say, at this point, most of our fears haven't come true. We haven't seen a spike in consumption. A significant increase among senior citizens, but I leave that to your own imagination."" The mention of seniors getting baked sparked laughter in the audience, but we wondered whether Hickenlooper was correct that after legalizing marijuana in Colorado, ""we haven't seen a spike in consumption."" We found there hasn’t been a spike, per se. However, marijuana use by adults has gone up consistently for a decade, before and after legalization.  Experts told us that the most comprehensive source for data on marijuana use is the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, an annual survey put together by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. We found two relevant measurements, each broken down by state, each of which showed similar patterns for Colorado. Here’s the data for reported marijuana use in the past month, broken down by a variety of age groups in Colorado: And here’s the data for reported marijuana use in the past year, again broken down by age groups: Each of the blue lines shows the trend for an adult group — 18 and older, 26 and older, or 18 to 25. All of these blue lines show the same general pattern: The usage rates rose, slowly and steadily, between 2008-2009 and 2016-2017. Hickenlooper has a point that usage rates didn’t ""spike."" However, it’s easy to hear his comment and assume that reported use of marijuana flatlined or even declined. And that’s not the case. For the 30-day rates — the more common metric that policymakers use, experts say — the increase in adult marijuana use ranged between a one-third jump and a doubling over eight years, depending on the age range. Other data backs this up. A state government report from 2018 summarized data from the Colorado Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a statewide telephone survey conducted by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. This study’s data on marijuana use goes back to 2014. The past-month figures for adults rose from 13.6 percent in 2014 to 15.5 percent in 2017, a jump the report called ""a significant increase."" The responses for daily or near-daily use grew from 6 percent in 2014 to 7.6 percent in 2017, which it also deemed ""a significant increase."" The patterns in Colorado did not surprise Jonathan P. Caulkins, a public policy professor at Carnegie-Mellon University and the former co-director of RAND’s Drug Policy Research Center. An upward trend is to be expected. Between 1992 to 2017, Caulkins said, the nationwide number of past-year users more than doubled, and past-month use tripled. The number of days of use went up several fold, and the number of daily or near-daily users increased tenfold, from 0.9 million to 9 million, he said. Oh, and about those toking seniors? Their numbers have gone up, as Hickenlooper said, according to Colorado data — from 3 percent in 2014 to 5.6 percent. Younger age groups showed increases between 2014 and 2017 as well. But use by seniors wouldn’t have been large enough to drive the trends. One likely reason for the rise among seniors: Every year sees more and more Baby Boomers turning 65, and they are used to using marijuana from their younger years. The one age group that bucked the pattern — and an important one from a policy perspective — is teenagers. They’re marked with the red line in the charts above. Strikingly, the use of marijuana by teens has, at most, stayed much the same, and perhaps even dropped a little. Experts cautioned that for teen use, the sample sizes of the SAMHSA study we used above are not very large. Other studies with larger sample sizes bear out the general pattern, however. Colorado has been tracking 30-day marijuana use among high-school students every two years since 2013 in its Healthy Kids Colorado survey. In 2013, 19.7 percent of respondents said they’d used marijuana in the past 30 days. That number rose slightly in 2015 to 21.2 percent, but then fell back to a new low in 2017, at 19.4 percent. So, if Hickenlooper had specified youth usage, he would have had a stronger argument. In fact, Hickenlooper’s own state government issued a news release in July 2018 that summed up the results this way: ""Marijuana use in Colorado rises for adults, stays the same for kids."" And when we reached out to Hickenlooper's campaign, they confirmed that he had meant to refer to usage by youths. ""He did mean to specify youth,"" said Lauren Hitt, a spokesman for Hickenlooper. ""He tells that story a lot."" For instance, he said in February 2017 on NBC's Meet the Press that ""we didn't see a spike in teenage use"" after legalization. He also said in July 2018, ""Preventing young people from using marijuana is a statewide priority. While youth use hasn’t gone up, we are working hard to educate Colorado parents and their children about the health and legal risks of underage marijuana use."" We should mention one notable caveat to all the studies cited above. ""These surveys are all based on self-reporting, and people are probably more likely to admit to using cannabis when it is legal compared to when it is illegal,"" said Mason Tvert, the former director of communications for the Marijuana Policy Project who is now with Vicente Sederberg, a marijuana-focused law firm. This could account for some of the increase over time, he said. Hickenlooper said that after legalizing marijuana in Colorado, ""we haven't seen a spike in consumption."" He has a point that legalization didn’t produce a rapid, sudden increase in marijuana use. But that doesn’t mean there wasn’t a continued increase. In Colorado, reported marijuana use climbed, slowly and steadily, for adults between 2008 and 2017. The one exception was teenagers, for whom usage rates largely remained steady",Half True,"March 25, 2019"
"''Over 40 percent of African-American men in (Milwaukee County) have been going to prison for low-level drug offenses, and I think a hundred times that in the city of Madison.""","The issue of decriminalization of marijuana is on the front burner in many states, including Wisconsin, where Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is backing a plan that would allow residents to smoke and sell small amounts of the drug. One of the goals of the proposal, Evers said, is to reduce the disproportionate rate at which the state's black residents are incarcerated. ""People shouldn't be treated like criminals for accessing medicine that could change or maybe even save their lives,"" Evers said at a Feb. 18, 2019, news conference announcing his plan. In supporting Evers’ plan, state Rep. David Crowley, D-Milwaukee, cited high incarceration rates for African-American males. ''Over 40 percent of African-American men in my county have been going to prison for low-level drug offenses, and I think a hundred times that in the city of Madison,"" Crowley said Feb. 24, 2019, on WKOW’s ""Capital City Sunday."" Is Crowley correct? Milwaukee County incarceration When asked for backup, Crowley’s staff cited a 2013 University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee study. The study  — ""Wisconsin’s mass incarceration of African American males: Workforce challenges for 2013"" — stated: ""Forty percent of the African American males from Milwaukee County incarcerated since 1990 were drug offenders."" But that covers all drug offenses, whereas Crowley used the figure to describe ""low-level drug offenses."" So, Crowley is clearly off — though it is difficult to say by how much. Molly Vidal, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Corrections, said in an email that ""There is not a Wisconsin-specific or universally common definition of ‘low-level offense.’"" One point of reference is the level Evers uses for his decriminalization measure. Under Evers’ plan, which faces strong opposition in the Republican-controlled Legislature, the state's agriculture and health departments would regulate medical marijuana and users, and manufacturers and distributors of medical marijuana would not be charged with crimes if they handled up to 25 grams of the drug. For perspective, 25 grams of marijuana could fit inside a plastic sandwich bag. According to NORML, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, marijuana is a Schedule I hallucinogenic substance under the Wisconsin Uniform Controlled Substances Act. Penalties can vary, depending upon the amount or whether it is person’s is a first or multiple offender. For example, a first offense possession charge is a misdemeanor that can result in up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $1,000, while possession of any amount (subsequent offense) is a felony and can result in up to 3.5 years incarceration and a maximum fine of $10,000. A November 2018 report on Dane County prison admissions notes ""in general, only criminal felony cases result in an order for a person to be admitted to the Wisconsin State Prisons."" Madison incarcerations As to the second part of the claim, that the rate in Madison is ""a hundred times"" that of Milwaukee County, Crowley aide Kyle Caudill said the lawmaker got it wrong ""The 100x comment was misspoken,"" Caudill said via email. ""It is referring to the figure in (a) CityLab article from 2016 stating that ‘in Dane County … black residents were admitted to prison for drug offenses at 97 times the rate of white residents."" The figure behind that quote is the African American drug prison admission rate is 433.76, while the white drug admission rate is 4.46. The numbers come from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. In any case, it is a massively jumbled comparison. The study in question compares the discrepancy between black and white incarceration within Dane County. It says nothing about how the African-American incarceration rate in Milwaukee County compares to that in Dane County. (What’s more, Crowley also erred in citing the city of Madison, not Dane County.) What about the gap? So, where do things stand when it comes to the incarceration gap? A Jan. 12, 2018, Pew Research Center article notes the gap is shrinking. Using numbers from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, it says ""a significant decline in the number of black prisoners in recent years has steadily narrowed the gap between blacks and whites in prison to the point where it is half as wide as it was in 2009, when America’s prison population peaked."" The article also says: At the end of 2016, federal and state prisons in the United States held about 486,900 inmates who were black and 439,800 who were white —a difference of 47,100, according to the BJS. In 2009, by comparison, there were 584,800 blacks and 490,000 whites — a difference of 94,800. (This analysis counts only inmates sentenced to more than a year.) Of course, since there are many more whites than blacks in the nation, the rate is a better measuring stick. The article notes: ""In 2016, there were 1,608 black prisoners for every 100,000 black adults – more than five times the imprisonment rate for whites (274 per 100,000) and nearly double the rate for Hispanics (856 per 100,000)."" It also notes that for the all three groups, the rate has declined since 2009. For blacks it has declined the sharpest (25 percent), compared to 19 percent for Hispanics and 11 percent for whites. A July 10, 2018, CNN report cited a number of theories about what's behind the closing gap, from tougher law enforcement in rural, mostly white areas, to the explosion of opioids and heroin, which have hit hardest in white communities. Those reports both relate to national numbers. Meanwhile, Wisconsin Department of Corrections data shows that the number of black offenders admitted to prison who were convicted in Milwaukee County, and whose most serious offense was a drug offense, has mostly been declining since 2009: 2009 — 510 offenders 2010 —  505 2011 — 361 2012 — 291 2013 — 251 2014 — 245 2015 — 219 2016 — 237 2017 — 235 2018 — 236 The number for 2018, the most recent year available, is about 54 percent lower than 2009. Our rating Crowley said ''Over 40 percent of African-American men in my county have been going to prison for low-level drug offenses, and I think a hundred times that in the city of Madison."" He was off on several levels -- from incorrectly applying the Milwaukee County number to only low-level offenses, to massively jumbling the Milwaukee County-to-Madison comparison.

"Says Thomas Jefferson drafted the Declaration of Independence on hemp paper, grew and smoked marijuana, and said ""hemp is of first necessity to the wealth and protection of the country.""","Thomas Jefferson was a diplomat, architect, author of the Declaration of Independence, the third president of the United States – and a pot smoker? One Facebook post makes the claim that the founding father drafted the Declaration of Independence on hemp paper and ""grew and smoked weed."" It also quotes Jefferson as saying that ""Hemp is of first necessity to the wealth and protection of the country."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We previously checked out the rumor that the Declaration of Independence was supposedly written on hemp paper and rated it False. For a quick re-hashing, officials at Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson, say that the document was penned on parchment, which is made from animal skin. ""A number of sites on the Internet claim that the Declaration of Independence was written on paper made from hemp. As far as we know, this is not true,"" Monticello says on its website. But did Jefferson actually grow and smoke marijuana and did he say hemp is the ""first necessity to the wealth and protection of this country?"" Well, there is one kernel of confirmable truth: Jefferson did grow hemp—but not necessarily ""weed,"" as the post suggests. While hemp comes from cannabis plants like marijuana, it doesn’t contain the same level of tetrahydrocannabinol—or THC, for short—the active chemical in marijuana that causes people to experience the ""high"" often associated with the drug. State statutes, with the exception of West Virginia, define industrial hemp as a variety of cannabis with a THC concentration of no more than 0.3 percent. (West Virginia puts it at less than 1 percent.) The level of THC in marijuana is not always the same and can vary depending on the strain or variety of the plant, the way it is grown, the part of the plant that is used and the way it is stored. Hash, for example, can have THC concentrations ranging from 10 to 20 percent, while marijuana cannabis (the dried buds and leaves of the plant) can vary widely in potency from 1 to 20 percent. It is also worth noting that the marijuana used today is stronger than it used to be. Jefferson grew hemp both at Monticello and his other plantation, Poplar Forest, but it was primarily used (along with flax and cotton) to make clothing. Other founding fathers, including George Washington, grew hemp and Americans were legally bound to grow the plant during the Colonial Era and Early Republic. But there is no record of Jefferson ever smoking the plant. The National Constitution Center, an institution devoted to the U.S. Constitution, tackled some of the most popular myths about the Founding Fathers and marijuana and noted that if Jefferson or others at the time did attempt smoking hemp, they likely didn’t experience euphoria because of its low levels of THC. Monticello addressed the rumor as well, and said there is no evidence to suggest that Jefferson was a habitual smoker of ""hemp, tobacco, or any other substance."" ""Some have pointed to a supposed reference in Jefferson's farm book to separating male and female hemp plants as evidence that he was cultivating it for purposes of recreational smoking,"" the organization wrote, ""... no such reference exists in Jefferson's farm book or any other document."" The quote that hemp is ""of first necessity to the wealth and protection of the country"" can be found in the national archived Jefferson papers, which is a collection of the correspondence and papers not only written by Jefferson, as well as letters he received. This particular phrase wasn’t written or said by Jefferson, said David Sewell, manager of Digital Initiatives of The University of Virginia Press, which works in conjunction with Founders Online. What’s more, the quote is a little incomplete.The phrase was written in ""Enclosure: Notes respecting Tobacco"" on March 16, 1791, by Gouverneur Morris, a founding father, American statesman, and a signatory to the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution. The full quote: ""A Fact well established in the System of Agriculture is that the best Hemp and the best Tobacco grow on the same Kind of Soil. The former Article is of first Necessity to the Commerce and Marine in other Words to the Wealth and Protection of the Country."" So while the comment was included in a letter sent to Jefferson, it wasn’t his words. ""If the words have been attributed to Jefferson,"" Sewell wrote in an email to PolitiFact, ""that is probably the result of someone’s misunderstanding of the context, or of wanting to associate them with someone with better name recognition."" It’s worth noting that while Jefferson may not have said this particular quote, he did consider hemp to be an important crop, and made several references to it in his letters. A meme being shared online claims that Thomas Jefferson penned the Declaration of Independence on hemp paper, grew and smoked marijuana, and once said the plant was of ""first necessity to the protection and wealth of the country."" The Declaration of Independence was not drafted on hemp, but on parchment made from animal skin, But Jefferson did indeed grow the plant (not necessarily weed, though). There is no evidence to suggest Jefferson ever smoked marijuana, and if he had, it likely would have been the hemp he grew, which had very low levels of THC. Jefferson also did not say that specific phrase, but his favor of the crop is well documented",Mostly False,"March 13, 2019"
"""Drug-related offenses make up as much as 75-85 percent of inmate populations"" in Wisconsin","Gov. Tony Evers’ announcement that he would push to decriminalize marijuana in Wisconsin was one of the biggest splashes of his young tenure. It drew media coverage from across the country and sparked a war of news releases on the homefront. Evers said Feb. 18, 2019, that his first budget would include proposals to legalize medical marijuana; allow possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use; and expand the ability to expunge certain drug possession convictions. A news release announcing the move touted the medicinal benefits of marijuana, then pivoted to making a social justice case for change. ""Reforming Wisconsin’s marijuana laws to align with the people’s support for medical marijuana is an important part of the governor’s plan,"" the release said. ""But so, too, is addressing the social and racial justice aspect of marijuana use. Wisconsin has the highest incarceration rate in the country for Black men, and drug-related crimes account for as many as 75-85 percent of all inmates in our prisons."" Evers touted the same 75-85 percent statistic in a since-deleted tweet that day making the case for decriminalizing marijuana. It was repeated in the text of the NBC News story on Evers’ announcement. That’s a really high number. Given all the possible actions that could land a person in prison, do drug crimes really account for three-quarters or more of all inmates? The Wisconsin Department of Corrections uses a number of measures to track how inmates landed behind bars. But none of them are anywhere close to Evers’ number. A February 2017 analysis examining the point of prison admission showed 27 percent of inmates were sent to prison for a drug crime in 2016. That included opioids, cocaine, amphetamines and marijuana. Marijuana crimes accounted for 6.4 percent of prison admissions. Meanwhile, a point-in-time analysis done by the department showed 22 percent of Wisconsin inmates had an active drug offense in 2017 — meaning that was among the offenses for which they were serving time. The numbers are even lower when examining only the most serious offense for each inmate — in other words the one most likely responsible for the length of their prison stay. Only 11 percent of inmates in 2017 had a drug offense as their most serious charge. By comparison, a violent crime was the most serious charge for 66 percent of offenders, and a property crime for 14 percent. So where did Evers get his number? When we asked Evers’ office for the evidence behind the drug offenses claim, Deputy Chief of Staff Melissa Baldauff said they made a mistake. Evers’ staff has since removed the statistic from the online version of the news release announcing Evers’ marijuana proposal. Related: U.S. Sen.

WUWM is Milwaukee’s National Public Radio affiliate. Ellwanger used the stat in the context of a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee study that found Wisconsin had the highest rates of incarceration in the nation for black residents. But he was wrong. ""Upon further investigation, the claim as reported in the WUWM article above did not appear to have sufficient substantiation, and it should have been removed from our document,"" Baldauff said in an email. ""So, the honest answer is that staff made a mistake. We have since updated our press release online to remove that statistic and note the error."" Evers’ tweet citing the statistic as proof of the need to decriminalize marijuana garnered more than 500 retweets before it was deleted several days later. Evers claimed in a news release and a tweet that drug-related crimes account for as 75 to 85 percent of the Wisconsin inmate population. That statistic was pulled from an incorrect article published six years ago. Current DOC data shows the actual number of prison inmates sentenced for drug offenses is a fraction of that number — about one-quarter of the prison population.

"As for recreational marijuana revenue projections, ""we are seeing all those numbers reach disappointing levels in the states that have legalized. They’re not meeting their targets for the most part.""","Gov. Andrew Cuomo wants New York state to legalize recreational marijuana. Some state lawmakers, including Assembly Majority Leader Crystal Peoples-Stokes, D-Buffalo, have long supported the idea. But there has been pushback to Cuomo’s proposal. Assemblymember Patricia Fahy, a Democrat from the Albany area, favors starting with decriminalization but raises concerns about youth usage and driving under the influence, among other issues. Fahy wrote an op-ed in the Times-Union of Albany and discussed her concerns in media interviews. In an interview with radio host Susan Arbetter, Fahy questioned how much tax money New York state would collect if recreational marijuana became legal. ""Everybody thinks that this is going to be a massive money-maker,"" she said. ""There are projections of $200 to $400 million additional in New York state. We are seeing all those numbers reach disappointing levels in the states that have legalized. They’re not meeting their targets for the most part.""     The Cuomo administration predicts $300 million in tax revenue from the sale of recreational marijuana once legalization is fully phased in, according to budget materials. But is Fahy correct? Have other states missed their revenue targets?   Ten other states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational marijuana, though Vermont and DC do not allow commercial sales. An assessment by New York State agencies on the effects of legalization, published in July 2018, warned that ""some states overestimated revenue initially, as they did not account for the length of time it takes for a recreational market to be established, leading to fewer than expected sales."" We asked Fahy’s spokesman, Alexander Flood, for evidence of her claim. He pointed us to California, where the state collected less than it anticipated in the first full year of marijuana sales after a rocky rollout. He also referred us to reporting that showed that Colorado’s revenues didn’t meet expectations in the beginning. ""The complexity of the laws at the state level being rolled out has, in turn, complicated revenue projections for these states,"" Flood wrote in an email. We looked at revenue results in states that have legalized commercial sales: Maine is still working on its rules and regulations, and Michigan just legalized in November 2018. While many states have seen impressive growth in revenue, predicting future revenue may be complicated. States have a difficult time predicting usage, pricing and how legalization in nearby states affect tax revenues, according to a report from Pew Charitable Trusts and the Rockefeller Institute for Government, both nonpartisan organizations. However, researchers wrote that ""volatility in marijuana tax collections has been less of an issue and has primarily stemmed from seasonality.""      Fahy said states that have legalized recreational marijuana ""are not meeting their targets for the most part."" It is true that, at first, some states struggled to meet their targets because of a slower than expected rollout of legalization. This occurred in Colorado, California and Alaska. Revenue, however, has grown in Colorado and Alaska. Oregon, Washington state and Nevada never had problems reaching their targets.

"""If the experiences in Colorado and Washington are the experiences we have here, roadway deaths are going to go up, impaired driving is likely to go up.""","Last month Tom Anderson, the commissioner of the Vermont Department of Public Safety, said at a public hearing that the state should not move forward with a recreational market for cannabis until police have access to roadside saliva tests.  Anderson said roadside testing for cannabis impairment is necessary because if Vermont legalizes a market for cannabis, it will see an increase in impaired driving and roadway deaths. The saliva tests would enable police to determine when drivers have the drug in their system. ""If the experiences in Colorado and Washington are the experiences we have here, roadway deaths are going to go up, impaired driving is likely to go up,"" Anderson said. A number of readers told us Anderson was off the mark. So we decided to find out: Have legal recreational cannabis markets in Colorado and Washington led to a rise in roadway deaths and impaired driving rates?  We reached out to the Department of Public Safety and asked for sources backing up the commissioner's claim.  In response, the department sent seven sources -- including five studies and two news articles from the Denver Post and the Bellingham Herald. The sources all show that rates of impaired driving and roadway fatalities have increased since cannabis was legalized.  However, even that data is contradictory. None of the sources have proven the increase was caused by the legalization of recreational cannabis markets alone, which was the point that Anderson seemed to be making.   It’s also important to note that no accurate roadside testing for cannabis impairment currently exists. At this point, law enforcement typically use blood tests to determine whether drivers have THC in their system. The drug, however, can remain in someone’s blood for weeks, making it difficult to determine the time at which someone is actually under the influence.  Recreational cannabis has been legal in Washington and Colorado since 2012. Recreational stores opened in 2014. A study by the Foundation for Traffic Safety reported in 2016 that an estimated 303 drivers — 10 percent of all drivers involved in fatal crashes in Washington between 2010 and 2014 — had detectable tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component of cannabis, in their blood at or shortly after the time of a crash. The number of drivers who tested positive for THC remained steady before and immediately after legalization took effect, according to the study. But researchers found that about nine months after cannabis was legally available for purchase, the number of drugged driving citations began increasing at a rate of almost 10 percentage points per year. It is unclear whether the increase was caused by the legalization of cannabis or by factors ""that were beyond the scope of the study.""  A study by the Colorado Department of Transportation published in August 2018 reported that overall, the number of fatalities involving drivers who tested positive for cannabis has nearly doubled since recreational legalization in 2014 -- from 75 that year to 125 in 2016 and 139 in 2017. However, in spite of cannabis-related driving fatalities going up, in the first quarter of 2017, the number of cannabis-related DUIs dropped by 33 percent from the same period in 2016, according to Colorado State Patrol. From January until March in 2017, 155 people received citations for cannabis impairment while driving, compared to 232 people in 2016.  The Colorado study does not point to legalization as the cause of the increase in cannabis impaired driving.  Another study last year, conducted by researchers at the University of Oregon, explicitly stated that the argument that legal cannabis has led to a spike in traffic deaths and impaired driving is misleading. The upward trend in cannabis-related fatalities in Colorado, and to some extent in Washington, would have taken place whether or not recreational cannabis was legalized, the authors say.  Some research clearly supports the claim that traffic accidents are on the rise in states that have legalized cannabis, but the reason behind why it is happening remains unclear to researchers. A study released in October by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) and Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI), estimated that the rate of car crashes rose a combined 6 percent following the start of retail sales of recreational cannabis in Colorado, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. Based on our research, Anderson’s statement that roadway deaths and impaired driving rates have gone up in Washington and Colorado is correct. But his implication that a legal recreational cannabis market is responsible for the uptick in impaired driving and traffic deaths has not been proven.  While the studies do not prove that legal recreational cannabis markets are the cause of impaired driving and traffic death increases in Colorado or Washington, it does serve as a ""solid indicator"" that cannabis can impact driver safety",Half True,"January 3, 2019"
"Says as a Schedule 1 drug, marijuana carries a designation that means it ""should not be researched""","Though a majority of states have legalized some form of marijuana use, it remains a Schedule 1 drug at the federal level. 
That means under federal law marijuana has ""no currently accepted medical use"" and a high potential for abuse. But U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., asserts the label comes with even more restrictions. Addressing her desire to make marijuana more available for American veterans, Baldwin said she is frustrated that marijuana remains a Schedule 1 drug, ""which is considered a drug with no beneficial characteristics at all, and therefore should not be researched or prescribed."" She said research is a key reason she wants to see marijuana removed from Schedule 1. ""So we lost, since that scheduling occurred, more than a generation of possible research to see safety, efficacy, etc.,"" Baldwin said in a Sept. 14, 2018, interview on ""Devil’s Advocates,"" a Milwaukee-based liberal radio talk show. ""So, (the) No. 1 outrage to me is that we don’t have the body of research in this country — the leading research-funding nation in the world — that would give answers to things we kind of ponder about."" We gave Baldwin a Mostly False rating for another marijuana claim from that interview -- that medical providers with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs are ""censored"" from talking with veterans about marijuana. Let’s see how this claim fares. What does Schedule 1 mean? Schedule 1 is the highest, most restrictive rating given to drugs in the federal code. Marijuana is joined on that list by heroin, ecstasy, LSD and opioid painkillers, among many others. The designation complicates matters for federal agencies such as the VA, which is limited by federal guidelines that conflict with state laws. Thirty-three states have now approved medical marijuana, and 10 of those allow recreational use as well, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Baldwin’s staff did not respond to inquiries seeking evidence for her claim that the Schedule 1 designation means marijuana ""should not be researched."" In fact, there are hundreds of current research studies involving marijuana, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. ""One of the biggest misconceptions is that Schedule I status of a drug makes it impossible for research.  This is simply not true,"" said Wade Sparks, a DEA spokesman. ""Schedule I research is absolutely permitted with a proper registration."" Aspiring researchers must get their research protocol approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, then apply for a DEA permit to handle, store and research marijuana or any other Schedule 1 drug. Sparks said security is typically a key hurdle, since the DEA must ensure research protocol is followed and drugs are properly secured. ""Every researcher who has put forth a valid research proposal has received permission to study marijuana,"" Sparks said. Researchers must also work with the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which contracts with the University of Mississippi to grow marijuana for research — the only legal research source of marijuana in the country. And there are U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirements for research that is related to the development of new drugs. There are currently 449 researchers registered with the DEA to study marijuana, and 249 registered for research of other Schedule 1 drugs, Sparks said. Indeed, much of that research is funded by the federal government. The National Institutes of Health approved about $269 million for hundreds of marijuana-related research projects in 2018. That includes projects focused on therapeutic properties of marijuana, including cannabidiol, which has potential medical benefits but doesn’t cause users to get high. ""In the last few years with the growth of information — both popular information and scientific information — on possible medical marijuana efficacy, there have been more studies approved by the federal government and funded by the federal government"" on the potential therapeutic benefits of the drug, said Igor Grant, director of the Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research at the University of California-San Diego. ""The climate is changing."" Our rating Making the case to remove marijuana from Schedule 1 status, Baldwin said that standing means marijuana ""should not be researched."" She said a ""generation"" of possible research has been lost as a result. Schedule 1 status does add additional hurdles for researchers, including approval from the DEA. But research is allowed and does happen — to the tune of more than 400 studies nationwide. So the statement has an element of truth but otherwise misses the mark",Mostly False,"November 21, 2018"
"Says VA doctors are ""censored from being able to talk to their patients"" about marijuana, even in states where it is legal for medicinal use","Legalized marijuana is gaining momentum in Wisconsin and nationwide after the Nov. 6, 2018 election, but U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin says it remains off the menu for veterans. Baldwin, who was elected to a second term, has said she is frustrated that marijuana remains a Schedule 1 drug under federal law, a category for drugs that have ""no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse."" Baldwin said veterans groups have told her they want the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to be allowed to research the medical benefits of marijuana and they want VA doctors to be able to talk about it. ""(Doctors) are gagged right now, if that’s the right word,"" Baldwin said in a Sept. 14, 2018, interview on ""Devil’s Advocates,"" a Milwaukee-based liberal radio talk show. ""They’re muzzled, or censored, from being able to talk to their patients about the potential beneficial qualities if they were to use medicinal cannabis, and we’re trying to change that."" Marijuana remains illegal at the federal level. Does that mean VA doctors can’t even discuss the drug? Let’s check it out. Marijuana, veterans are key issues Veterans were a central issue in Baldwin’s race against Republican Leah Vukmir, who criticized Baldwin’s inaction after whistleblowers reported concerns at the Tomah Veterans Affairs Medical Center in 2014. Some veterans had dubbed the facility ""Candy Land,"" due to the widespread distribution of opioids, which led to the 2014 death of a former U.S. Marine. Baldwin disciplined top aides for the response to the whistleblowers and has since co-sponsored legislation to toughen opioid prescription guidelines and push education for VA providers. And marijuana has proven a winning issue in this election cycle. Michigan voters approved recreational marijuana on Tuesday, and Missouri and Utah legalized medical marijuana. North Dakota voters rejected what would have been the nation’s most permissive recreational use law. In Wisconsin, 16 counties and two cities had advisory referendums on marijuana-related questions. More than 70 percent of voters in Milwaukee and Dane counties said Wisconsin should legalize marijuana for recreational use, and in the city of Waukesha, 77 percent were in favor of legalizing marijuana for medical use. VA won’t dispense, recommend marijuana Marijuana straddles an awkward line between federal and state policy. It remains illegal per federal law, but 33 states have now approved medical marijuana, and 10 of those allow recreational use as well, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. And veterans are using marijuana for their ailments. A study based on a 2014 survey found about 9 percent of veterans in the U.S. reported using marijuana in the previous year — roughly the same as the general population. About 41 percent reported using it for medical reasons -- a rate more than double the national average. The VA says its health care providers are limited by federal law and can’t recommend, prescribe or help veterans obtain marijuana — regardless of what state the facility is in. An information sheet on the department’s website details those restrictions, noting the VA also will not pay for medical marijuana prescriptions or allow marijuana use or possession at a VA medical center. But the sheet says the topic is not forbidden. ""VA providers can and do discuss marijuana use with veterans as part of comprehensive care planning, and adjust treatment plans as necessary,"" the sheet says. ""Veterans are encouraged to discuss marijuana use with their VA providers."" It also notes veterans will not be denied VA benefits because of marijuana use and that providers will record marijuana use in the confidential medical record to have it available for treatment planning. A Baldwin spokesperson defended her claim, saying the bans have a chilling effect. ""There is a clear prohibition on recommending or prescribing medical marijuana in the VA policy, which suppresses the ability of doctors to talk to veterans about all of their potential treatment options,"" said Kasey Hampton, Baldwin’s spokeswoman. Our rating Baldwin said VA doctors ""are censored"" from talking to patients about the benefits of marijuana. But the evidence her office cites relates only to VA bans on recommending or prescribing the drug. And VA guidelines explicitly encourage veterans to discuss marijuana use with providers. There’s an element of truth to Baldwin’s claim — since those discussions are presumably limited by the restrictions the VA imposes — but there is no evidence of censorship",Mostly False,"November 9, 2018"

"Says marijuana is ""legal in most states in this country.""","During a stump speech at country music superstar Willie Nelson’s September 29, 2018, rally in Austin, for U.S. Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke, the El Paso congressman told a crowd of more than 50,000 supporters that marijuana use is legal in most states. O’Rourke set up the claim at the ""Turn out for Texas"" rally by describing the nation's ""war on drugs"" as a ""war on people, and some people more than other people."" He was talking about people of color, he explained.

""Only some are getting arrested,"" said O’Rourke, the Democrat challenging Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. ""Only some are doing time. Only some are checking a box on an application form that makes it that less likely that they'll get that job. Only some will not qualify for Pell Grants for possession of a substance that is legal in most states in this country."" The way O’Rourke summed up marijuana laws, which vary by state, territory and depth, made our ears perk, so we asked his campaign about the claim. Chris Evans, communications director for O’Rourke’s campaign, shared with PolitiFact Texas in an email Business Insider and ABC News reports to support the congressman’s claim, but their evidence doesn’t show that marijuana use is legal across-the-board in most states. ""As of today, marijuana is illegal in only 20 states,"" Evans said in the email. ""That's less than half of the states. Beto has called for ending the federal prohibition on marijuana and co-sponsored bipartisan legislation to achieve this."" The articles explain that using marijuana recreationally is legal in nine states, while medical marijuana is legal in 30. Oklahoma in June became the 30th and latest state to authorize medical marijuana. In a deep dive on marijuana legislation across the country, the National Conference of State Legislatures reaches the same count. Voters in North Dakota and Michigan this November will have the choice to approve adult use of marijuana, while voters in Utah and Missouri will decide whether to authorize medical marijuana, according to Forbes. We also posed questions to Mason Tvert, spokesman with the Marijuana Policy Project, a Washington D.C.-based organization whose mission includes increasing ""public support for non-punitive, non-coercive marijuana policies.""

Tvert told us that if we're talking legal marijuana use for individuals 21 and older, that's the case in only nine states (Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Colorado, Maine, Vermont and Massachusetts) plus Washington, D.C. and the Northern Mariana Islands. Also, 30 states allow medical marijuana use with a doctor's recommendation, he said. Nineteen states ""have laws on the books that acknowledge the medical value of medical cannabis, but fall short,"" the organization states on its website. Tvert explained that in those states some marijuana use is legal when it's for medical purposes, but there are limits on products authorized and who can access them. More specific, in some states, medical marijuana may be legal, but ""they don't have a legal form of production,"" or it's only available for a tiny number of people and for certain conditions, he said.

After we read O’Rourke’s claim to Tvert, he said the claim doesn’t strike him as incorrect. But how could O'Rourke have been more clear? Had he said most states have made marijuana legal in some form, ""it would be undeniably 100 percent accurate,"" Tvert said. Our ruling O’Rourke said marijuana is legal in most states. Only nine states have legalized marijuana use for all adults. But 30 have some form of legal use for medical purposes, giving O'Rourke's statement an element of truth",Mostly False,"October 5, 2018"
"""Evidence is mounting that marijuana legalization reduces opioid addiction numbers.""","Nathan McMurray, a Democrat running in New York’s 27th Congressional District in Western New York, supports legalizing marijuana. He says doing so can help alleviate opioid addiction and financially benefit rural areas. ""Evidence is mounting that marijuana legalization reduces opioid addiction numbers,"" it says on McMurray's campaign website. The Grand Island town supervisor has called for an end to the ""failed war on drugs"" by passing federal legislation that legalizes cannabis products. McMurray said he supports the Marijuana Justice Act bills (H.R. 4815 / S. 1689) that are currently in U.S. House and Senate committees. The proposed legislation would remove cannabis from the Federal Controlled Substances Act, and expunge federal marijuana use and possession crimes. McMurray says the legalization and taxation of cannabis in farming districts like NY-27 can benefit the local economy and generate tax revenues for the treatment of serious addictions. There is no way to know if lawmakers would use the tax revenue for opioid addiction treatment.  But would legalizing marijuana reduce opioid addiction? Several studies have examined a possible link between marijuana legalization and opioid use. The outcomes were mixed. An October 2014 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that ""states with medical cannabis laws had a 24.8 percent lower mean annual opioid overdose rate compared with states without medical cannabis laws."" Medical marijuana laws reduced opioid overdose deaths over time, according to the study, which studied medical cannabis laws and opioid overdose mortality from 1999 to 2010 from all 50 states. In 2018, the same journal published a study of Medicare Part D patients, which found that in places where medical marijuana is legal, prescriptions for opioids decreased. ""Medical cannabis laws are associated with significant reductions in opioid prescribing in the Medicare Part D population,"" researchers wrote.   The National Institute on Drug Abuse, however, cautioned against reaching conclusions from the various published studies, some of which the institute funded. ""Some studies have suggested that medical marijuana legalization might be associated with decreased prescription opioid use and overdose deaths, but researchers don't have enough evidence yet to confirm this finding,"" the institute states. The studies ""are population-based and can’t show that medical marijuana legalization caused the decrease in deaths or that pain patients changed their drug-taking behavior."" What's more, a study published in September 2017 in the American Journal of Psychiatry offered a contradictory finding. Researchers at the Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center and the National Institute on Drug Abuse found that ""cannabis use appears to increase rather than decrease the risk of developing nonmedical prescription opioid use and opioid use disorder."" The researchers relied on data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. More than 43,000 American adults were interviewed in 2001-2002 and follow-up interviews were done with 34,000 of them in 2004-2005.  The researchers found that although most adults who used marijuana did not develop an opioid use disorder, using marijuana significantly increased the risk of developing an opioid use disorder, according to a Columbia University release.  The National Institute on Drug Abuse acknowledges studies that show legally protected medical marijuana dispensaries, not just medical marijuana legalization, are associated with decreases in opioid prescribing, self-reports of opioid misuse, and treatment admissions for opioid addiction. The institute is continuing to study the relationship between legalized marijuana and opioid use, as well as marijuana’s possible use in treatment of opioid use disorder. McMurray said ""evidence is mounting"" that marijuana legalization reduces opioid addiction. He did not call it a proven fact, which may have led to a different ruling. There is evidence that in places where marijuana is legal, there are fewer opioid deaths and fewer opioid prescriptions. It's important to keep in mind that the change in number of prescriptions cannot be presumed to be a change in how many people overdose. Besides, overdoses from prescribed opioids is only one part of the crisis.  The National Institute on Drug Abuse has raised some red flags about drawing sweeping conclusions from the research and advises more studies are needed",Mostly True,"August 31, 2018"
"Marijuana and THC ""have caused emergency room visits to skyrocket.""","Advocates against marijuana legalization frequently cite increased marijuana-related hospitalizations as proof the drug should not be sold commercially. But how much of a threat does cannabis actually present? Since retiring from Congress in 2010, Patrick J. Kennedy has been speaking out about his struggles with drug addiction and mental health. Kennedy is the co-founder of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a non-profit dedicated to combating cannabis legalization. The group refers to marijuana as ""the next ‘Big Tobacco’"" and advocates for increased research into cannabis as a potential medicinal source, rather than a recreational drug. In Kennedy’s home state of Rhode Island, the push for recreational legalization continues. In February 2018, the Rhode Island General Assembly resolved to create a working committee to study the effects of legalization. In May, Sen. Joshua Miller introduced a bill to the House to legalize for all people 21 and over. The day after the bill was introduced, the Providence Journal published an editorial by Kennedy. In it, Kennedy draws connections between addiction and mental illness, and encourages readers to take control of their mental health through ""healthy coping mechanisms and problem solving skills."" Especially for children, he writes, turning to drugs as a way of handling stress is a dangerous road to follow. Good as that all sounds, one line in particular stood out to us: ""These drugs (marijuana/THC), which masquerade as food, have caused emergency room visits to skyrocket,"" Kennedy wrote. Researchers are still working to determine the long-term health consequences of marijuana. Although each person reacts to THC differently, no deaths caused by marijuana alone have ever been recorded, according to a Drug Enforcement Administration fact sheet. Regardless of immediate health risks, though, marijuana can impair judgement, leading to more accidents, or cause anxiety and paranoia in some users, leading to panic attacks that may prompt hospital visits. We decided to look at the numbers and determine if marijuana really has caused emergency room visits to increase. When we contacted Kennedy about this claim, Kennedy’s spokeswoman directed us to two studies about marijuana usage in Colorado: one conducted by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, and another compiled by Smart Against Marijuana. Colorado was one of the first states to legalize marijuana for recreational use. Retail marijuana stores opened in early 2014, and medical marijuana had been legal since 2000. Colorado has also collected the most data on the consequences of marijuana legalization, serving as the template for other states considering the move. Hospitalization and emergency department visit rates related to marijuana are studied based on patient records. When a patient arrives at the emergency department, they are assigned ""billing codes,"" which list their conditions. According to the American Health Information Management Association, the primary diagnoses should be listed first. The 2015 report from the Colorado Department of Public Health shows that hospitalizations with marijuana-related billing codes have climbed steadily over the years. In 2011, 1,313 per 100,000 hospitalizations had marijuana-related billing codes, a figure which had risen to 3,025 by 2015. However, hospitalizations and emergency department visits—the statistic that Kennedy claims to be citing—are slightly different. Emergency department visits refer to patients who come to the hospital and are treated without being admitted. According to Dr. Daniel Vigil, program manager of the Marijuana Health Monitoring and Research Program at the Colorado Department of Public Health, hospitalizations are more likely to include marijuana-related billing codes. ""The limitation that a marijuana code might be present even when it isn't a causal factor in the visit may be more pronounced with hospitalizations, because there's more opportunity for gathering and documenting substance use information,"" Dr. Vigil told us in an email. ""For this reason, I'm more likely to discuss the (emergency department) visit rates when asked about health impacts."" So, although hospitalization rates are increasing in Colorado, emergency department rates are not. The emergency rate had increased from 2011 to 2014, peaking at 1,034 per 100,000 emergency visits, but then fell significantly in 2015 to only 754 per 100,000. In both this dataset and the data for hospitalizations, researchers counted any patient with a marijuana-related billing code, even if that code was unrelated to the injury being treated. So, if a patient were to come in with a cut on their hand, but also had smoked a few hours prior, they would receive a billing code and count as a ""marijuana-related hospitalization."" What’s it all mean? In Colorado, there has been a significant increase in patients being hospitalized with marijuana in their system. In the last decade, the hospitalization rate has more than doubled. However, it’s important to recognize that these numbers, while increasing, still make up a very small percentage of the total hospital visits. Three percent of hospitalizations in Colorado had a marijuana-related code in 2015, which could mean anything from ""patient is currently high"" to ""patient smokes weed habitually."" Only 0.6% of Colorado hospitalizations list marijuana in the top 3 billing codes. And again, none of that means that people are in the hospital because of marijuana. There are currently few studies which examine marijuana-related hospitalizations within individual states, even in areas where recreational cannabis has been legalized. One nationwide study by Dr. He Zhu of Duke University Medical Center showed that across the United States, between 2004 and 2011, emergency department visits that involved the use of cannabis had increased from 51 to 73 per 100,000 patients between 2004 and 2011. Those that involved cannabis combined with other drugs had also increased from 63 to 100 per 100,000. So again, definitely a trend upwards, but marijuana-related cases still encompassed less than 0.01% of total hospitalizations. Similarly to the Colorado studies, the researchers relied on hospital records that could not identify cannabis as the cause of the visit, but rather just a contributing factor. Additionally, because the study only used data up until 2011, it could not accurately reflect the trends related to recreational sales. We cannot conclusively say that marijuana has caused an increase in visits to the emergency room. Rather, the data show that more people are arriving at the hospital having recently or habitually used cannabis, even if that is not their primary condition (or related at all to their primary condition). Through it seems plausible that impaired judgment or slowed reflexes may be a culprit, it is impossible to say how often that is true. Dr. Jerome Avorn, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, told us for a 2016 fact-check, ""The main risk from marijuana is from the risky or stupid things people do after using it, such as driving, rather than from any toxic effects of the substance itself, which is remarkably safe."" Kennedy wrote that marijuana and THC, ""have caused emergency room visits to skyrocket."" It is true that hospitalizations have increased over the last decade by people using marijuana, both in states like Colorado that have legalized recreational cannabis and nationwide. However, due to the way hospitals keep patient records, it is impossible to say that marijuana is the cause of these visits. Rather, it is possible that the higher numbers of high patients are due simply to the fact that more people are using marijuana overall. To say that marijuana is causing emergency room visits to skyrocket is unfounded based on the limited data that has been collected",Half True,"July 6, 2018"
"""Black and Latino people in NYC are arrested at TEN times the rate of white people for virtually the same rate of marijuana usage.""","Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand says legalizing marijuana would benefit communities of color, particularly in New York City. Gillibrand says people of color are arrested for marijuana possession at a much higher rate than white people, despite similar marijuana use. ""Black and Latino people in NYC are arrested at TEN times the rate of white people for virtually the same rate of marijuana usage,"" Gillibrand tweeted. New York state is exploring the possibility of legalizing marijuana for recreational use. The state Department of Health has begun a study on how legalization would affect residents. So are blacks and Latinos arrested ten times as often as white people for marijuana? New York City data Gillibrand relied on data from a February article published by Politico New York, which cited data from the state Division of Criminal Justice Services. The agency provided that data to us for this article. The numbers confirm Gillibrand’s claim: Eighty-six percent of people arrested for criminal possession of marijuana in New York City last year were either black or Hispanic. Five percent were classified as ""other"" by the agency. Nine percent of those arrested were white. The agency tracked 17,880 total criminal marijuana arrests in New York City last year. Almost half of the people arrested — 8,565 — were black. Some 6,853 were Hispanic and 890 were identified as ""other."" Only 1,572 of the offenders were white. There are a few caveats to the data. For one, it doesn’t include every marijuana arrest in the city. The data only tracks arrests for burning marijuana in public or possessing more than 25 grams at a time. More severe crimes, like selling marijuana, are not included in the numbers. The data also excludes cases where a more serious crime was involved. For example, if marijuana was found on someone pulled over for driving while intoxicated, the agency would not report the drug possession in this dataset. Statewide data The gap is not as wide outside New York City, state data shows. There were 5,417 of the same type of marijuana arrests upstate and on Long Island in 2017, according to the data. Of those, about 31 percent were white, 37 percent were black, and 25 percent were Hispanic. The remaining arrests were marked as ""other."" That still means about two-thirds of those arrested for marijuana possession outside New York City were people of color in 2017. Marijuana use by race Gillibrand also said the rate of marijuana use is the same regardless of race. The Politico article cites data compiled by the American Civil Liberties Union to support that claim. Fourteen percent of blacks and 12 percent of whites reported using marijuana in the past year in 2010, according to federal data. The ACLU analyzed data from the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Program and the U.S. Census Bureau.  Jon Gettman, an associate professor of criminal justice at Shenandoah University, used the same data to calculate more recent numbers for this article. About 14 percent of whites and 16 percent of blacks reported using marijuana in the past year in 2016. Data previously compiled by Gettman for the Brookings Institution showed the rates of use by whites and blacks have been about the same since at least 2001. Our ruling Gillibrand said blacks and Latinos in New York City are arrested at 10 times the rate of whites for marijuana possession, despite using it at about the same rate as whites. State data proves Gillibrand’s claim. Nine percent of people arrested for marijuana possession in the city last year were white versus 86 percent that were black or hispanic. Analyses of federal data also shows white people report using marijuana about as much as black people",True,"April 25, 2018"
"""A majority of Americans now live in states where they have decided to legalize cannabis,"" including recreational and medical marijuana.","For the first time this week, Californians can celebrate ""4/20,"" the unofficial pot holiday, by purchasing legal recreational cannabis at dispensaries across the state.

They would meet at 4:20,"" in the afternoon, according to a short history behind the holiday. The time and date are now a core part of popular marijuana culture. Voters approved Proposition 64 in 2016, which allowed retail sales to start in January. It added California to what is currently a list of nine states, plus Washington D.C., where recreational marijuana is legal. But just how many people in the United States can legally use marijuana, in some form, on ""4/20"" or any other day?   California Treasurer John Chiang made a recent claim saying:  ""A majority of Americans now live in states where they have decided to legalize cannabis.""

The letter was signed by state treasures from Oregon, Illinois and Pennsylvania, as well as several cannabis industry representatives. Marijuana remains illegal, in all forms, under federal law. In January, Sessions rescinded an Obama administration memo that recommended a hands-off approach to marijuana prosecution in states that have legalized pot. The move was seen as possibly paving the way for a federal crackdown on marijuana users and suppliers, though it’s uncertain whether that will happen.

But it’s also the broadest collection of states we found and stretches the case on whether a state has really legalized any form of marijuana. We decided to limit our count to states where voters or a state legislature has approved a comprehensive law authorizing medical or recreational marijuana. We found 29 states, plus Washington D.C., that meet that criteria, based on news reports. Nine have legalized recreational marijuana while the rest have legalized medical marijuana.    Even with this smaller group of states, however, Chiang’s statement holds up. There are more than 207 million people in these states, based on our review of census data. That’s easily a majority of America’s 325 million people. Our ruling  California Treasurer John Chiang recently claimed: ""A majority of Americans now live in states where they have decided to legalize cannabis."" His office pointed to a report that shows 44 states have some form of legal marijuana, though that list includes some states with only ""limited medical marijuana"" legalization and no comprehensive law authorizing the use. In reality, 29 states, plus Washington D.C., have passed laws authorizing recreational marijuana, medical marijuana or both. But even with this smaller group, Chiang’s statement is correct. That’s because more than 200 million Americans live in these states, representing a clear majority of the country’s 325 million people",True,"April 19, 2018"
"""I think we're actually ahead"" on legalizing marijuana for recreational use in New York state.","Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo touts New York state as a progressive beacon for the rest of the country. But his primary opponent, Cynthia Nixon, says that’s not true when it comes to recreational marijuana. It’s not legal in New York state. Cuomo was asked about the issue during a recent exchange with reporters on Long Island. ""Given what’s happened in Massachusetts, California, what could happen in New Jersey, do you feel as if New York is behind on this at all?"" NY1 Reporter Zack Fink asked Cuomo. ""No, I think we’re actually ahead on it,"" Cuomo said. ""We announced months ago that we were going to study the legalization issue precisely for that reason. You have Massachusetts, you have New Jersey talking about it."" Earlier this year, Cuomo asked the state Department of Health to study what legalizing marijuana would mean for New York state. The study will reportedly be finished this fall. Some states have already legalized marijuana for recreational use. So, what was Cuomo talking about when he said ""we’re actually ahead on it?"" What Cuomo was saying Cuomo did not mean to say New York state was ahead of other states that already legalized recreational marijuana, a spokesperson said. He meant that the Department of Health study would put New York state ahead of others in responding to the federal government's new position on state marijuana laws. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded an Obama-era rule earlier this year that allowed states to legalize marijuana without federal interference. States with legal marijuana have mostly shrugged off the decision. Context matters here. A reporter asked Cuomo if New York state was falling behind states that already legalized recreational marijuana. Cuomo said New York state was not, and his full response makes little mention of the federal position. States with legal marijuana Nine states and Washington, D.C., have legalized recreational marijuana. The state legislature in Vermont recently voted to make recreational marijuana legal later this year. The other states legalized recreational use through ballot referendums.  New Jersey and Michigan may be next. New Jersedy Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, supports legalization and wants lawmakers to approve a bill this year. Advocates in Michigan have gathered enough signatures to put legalization on the ballot in November. Colorado was the first state to legalize marijuana for recreational use in 2012. New York state, however, is taking steps toward legalization that other states have not. The study from the state Department of Health leaves the option for legalization on the table. New York state marijuana laws Cuomo has been opposed to legalizing recreational marijuana. He has called it a ""gateway drug."" But he supports decriminalizing marijuana -- ending criminal penalties for possessing and using small amounts of the drug. Selling it would still carry a penalty. New York state legalized marijuana for medicinal use in 2014. The state’s program has expanded since its inception, allowing more conditions to be treated with the drug and wider access statewide. Our ruling Cuomo said New York state is ahead of other states on legalizing marijuana for recreational use. That’s not true. Nine other states have already legalized recreational marijuana. Other states have also taken steps toward legalization that New York state has not. New Jersey’s governor has called on the legislature to legalize the drug, while voters in Michigan are expected to decide on legalization later this year",False,"April 17, 2018"
"""Despite decades of marijuana being used for smoking in the United States, there have been no reported medical cases of lung cancer"" attributed to marijuana.","John Morgan, the lawyer who spearheaded Florida’s 2016 constitutional amendment to allow medical marijuana use, says that the Legislature has ignored the will of the voters by banning smoking it. In November, about 71 percent of Florida voters approved the medical marijuana amendment. To implement the new law, the Legislature passed a provision that defines medical use to exclude smoking marijuana. Morgan filed a lawsuit July 6 asking the Leon County Circuit Court to declare the Legislature’s provision unenforceable. He says that while the amendment allows the Legislature to ban smoking in public, it does not allow it to ban smoking in general. In the lawsuit, Morgan made some claims about the benefits of marijuana and then said this: ""Despite decades of marijuana being used for smoking in the United States, there have been no reported medical cases of lung cancer or emphysema attributed to marijuana."" There have been people who smoked marijuana who had lung cancer, but that in itself doesn’t tell us if marijuana caused the cancer. We found some evidence to support Morgan’s statement, but the research comes with significant caveats and experts say more research is needed to reach more definitive conclusions. (Morgan also mentioned emphysema, but we will focus here on cancer.) Ben Pollara, who worked with Morgan on the amendment, sent us multiple articles related to research on cancer and marijuana. The most comprehensive information comes from a January 2017 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. The report was written by a committee of experts who reviewed studies since 1999 regarding health effects of using cannabis and cannabis-derived products related to various diseases including lung cancer. In the section on lung cancer, the researchers looked at research and concluded: ""There is moderate evidence of no statistical association between cannabis smoking and the incidence of lung cancer."" However the committee also noted that the studies it reviewed -- and research in general about marijuana -- had limitations: • A 2015 study published in the journal Cancer pooled data on 2,159 lung cancer cases. This study found no statistically significant association between smoking cannabis and lung cancer incidence including for a subgroup of study participants who were not tobacco smokers. However, the study noted that ""the possibility of potential adverse effect for heavy consumption cannot be excluded."" The study relied on patients’ self-reporting about their use of cannabis. • In 2015, the American Association for Cancer Research published an epidemiologic review. One study evaluated lung cancer risk among 49,321 Swedish military conscripts over a 40-year period and found they had a statistically significant risk of developing lung cancer compared with those who didn’t use cannabis. However, the report noted several gaps related to the Swedish study, which the author has acknowledged. Overall, the National Academies report called for more research about marijuana and health effects while noting several barriers, including that it is classified as a Schedule 1 substance and that researchers often find it difficult to gain access to the quantity, quality, and type of cannabis product necessary to address specific research questions. Pollara also pointed to information on the American Cancer Society website that listed marijuana in a section on factors with uncertain or unproven effects on lung cancer risk. The ACS states that there are some reasons to think that smoking marijuana might increase lung cancer risk, including that marijuana smoke contains tar. However, it also explains that it’s difficult to research the impact of marijuana since the use has been illegal in many places for a long time, and many lung cancer patients have smoked marijuana and tobacco, making it difficult to attribute causes. ""More research is needed to know the cancer risks from smoking marijuana,"" ACS states. Many experts we reached echoed the sentiment that additional research is needed. Harvard Medical School professor Bertha K. Madras reviewed multiple studies and her conclusion was similar to the National Academies report that there didn’t appear to be an association. However, Madras expressed caution about reaching conclusions. ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence,"" she told PolitiFact. ""Data are old. Currently we have more persons smoking high potency marijuana daily than years ago, when most studies were collecting data."" A 2016 literature review written by University of Tampa health sciences professor Mary Martinasek showed that while some studies indicated an increased risk of lung cancer, others found no such link or a lower risk for lung cancer.  ""There is little evidence to support statistical associations either for or against cannabis and lung cancer,"" she said. ""We need more research to confirm or deny an association."" Dr. Suzanne Sisley, who is an expert witness for Morgan and is doing an FDA approved trial related to marijuana and PTSD, said that the federal government has sought for decades to prove smoking marijuana caused lung cancer and has been unable to do so. Morgan said, ""Despite decades of marijuana being used for smoking in the United States, there have been no reported medical cases of lung cancer"" attributed to marijuana. The most comprehensive analysis about the health effects related to cannabis comes from a 2017 report by the National Academies of Sciences. The report found ""moderate evidence of no statistical association between cannabis smoking and the incidence of lung cancer."" However, the report also noted various limitations of the research. Overall, the academies called for more research -- a sentiment shared by other experts we interviewed.  Morgan’s statement is partially accurate, but more evidence is needed before definitely declaring smoking marijuana is risk-free when it comes to lung cancer",Half True,"July 13, 2017"
"""After prohibition ended, police deaths didn't reach 200 a year again until the year Nixon declared war on drugs.""","On Thursday – which was the unofficial stoner holiday of 4/20 – supporters of legal marijuana and opponents of the U.S. ""war on drugs"" took to the internet to make the case for their causes. One widely shared image made an unexpected implication – that decriminalizing drugs could be a pro-police move. It features images of police destroying liquor bottles and marijuana plants, with this text: ""Did you know? More American police officers died during prohibition of alcohol than any other time in history. 300 died in 1930 alone. After prohibition ended, police deaths didn't reach 200 a year again until the year Nixon declared war on drugs."" A quick Google search showed us the image has been popping up on Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and other websites – and that it has been making the rounds since at least 2015. The message is clear: When the government bans popular substances, like liquor or marijuana, black market trade makes life more dangerous for those enforcing the ban. We wondered, however, if the data actually supported that message. The war on drugs Marijuana and other drugs had been illegal in the United States for years before the federal government – under President Richard Nixon, as the image correctly states – launched what we now call the ""war on drugs."" In June 1971 Nixon declared ""a full-scale attack on the problem of drug abuse in America."" He called for harsher drug laws and millions of dollars in extra spending, and Congress complied. Today, spending on the drug war has continued to grow, and the United States has either the largest or second-largest prison population in the world. Yet marijuana remains popular. A CBS poll released Thursday found 61 percent of Americans favor legalizing pot and 33 percent are opposed. It also found 88 percent of Americans support medical marijuana. A 2015 National Institute on Drug Abuse survey reported that 22.2 million people – 7 percent of the U.S. population – had used pot within the last month. That’s about twice the rate at which people are abusing the second-most popular drug, illicit prescription painkillers (see fact-checks on opioids here, here and here). A deadly job? Comparing Prohibition with the drug war is common in American culture. Just listen to the popular 1988 country song ""Copperhead Road"" by Steve Earle, about a man from an Appalachian moonshining clan who switches the family business to weed. But is it also fair to compare police deaths during the two periods? That’s a little iffy. It’s correct that 1930 was the deadliest year in U.S. history for police. The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, which tracks officer deaths going back to 1791, says 307 officers died in 1930. It’s also correct that police deaths decreased sharply after Prohibition. But the numbers behind the claim that ""police deaths didn't reach 200 a year again until the year Nixon declared war on drugs"" are a bit off. Nixon began the war on drugs in 1971, but police deaths actually topped 200 the year before that in 1970. And that wasn’t any sort of a spike – the number of deaths had been just below 200 all throughout the late 1960s. And that’s not the only thing wrong with this claim. Not all deaths are violent The image clearly uses the violence associated with organized crime to make its point. However, not every officer who dies in any given year is killed by someone else in the line of duty. Many officers die from car crashes, illnesses and other causes. Yet the data this viral post cites on police deaths includes all deaths of police officers each year – violent and non-violent, on-duty and off-duty. In 2007, according to the memorial group, 202 officers died. According to FBI data, 57 of those officers were killed by a criminal while on duty. That means nearly three-fourths of the deaths that year were not the kind of violent deaths this image is alluding to. And even while on duty that year, an officer was more likely to have been killed in an accident than by a criminal. Fewer police deaths We focused on 2007 for a reason. In the last 36 years, only 2007 and 2001 (due to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks) have had more than 200 officer deaths. Yet the typical person who sees this image might very well believe that 200 or more police officers are continuing to die each year during the war on drugs. In reality that’s only happened 12 times, and only twice since 1981",Mostly True,"April 24, 2017"
"During his campaign for president, Donald Trump ""committed to honoring states' rights when it comes to marijuana legalization."""," The Trump Administration signaled last week it could crack down on recreational marijuana in states such as California where voters legalized pot last November, marking a possible change from the Obama Administration’s more permissive approach. ""There is still a federal law we need to abide by in terms of when it comes to recreational marijuana and other drugs of that nature,"" White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters on Feb. 23, 2017. ""I do believe that you'll see greater enforcement."" The next day, Democratic California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom urged Trump in a letter to follow the hands-off pot approach he claimed Trump had promised during his campaign. ""A Quinnipiac poll released yesterday says that 71-percent of US voters (say) that the government should not interfere with states that passed legalized marijuana and during your campaign, you committed to honoring states’ rights when it comes to marijuana legalization,"" Newsom wrote on Feb. 24, 2017.  Newsom also helped write California’s voter-approved ballot measure, Proposition 64, that legalized recreational marijuana last November. He is running for California governor in 2018. We wanted to know whether Newsom was right: Had Trump ""committed"" during his campaign to leaving recreational pot up to the states? Our research Newsom’s spokesman pointed to three examples during his campaign where Trump said marijuana legalization should be up to the states. In a television interview on July 29, 2016 with KUSA-TV in Colorado, Trump said: ""I wouldn’t do that [using federal authority to shut down recreational marijuana], no … I wouldn’t do that … I think it’s up to the states, yeah. I’m a states person. I think it should be up to the states, absolutely."" In a radio interview with WWJ Newsradio 950 in Michigan on March 8, 2016, Trump said ""I think it certainly has to be a state — I have not smoked it — it’s got to be a state decision …  I do like it, you know, from a medical standpoint … it does do pretty good things. But from the other standpoint, I think that it should be up to the states."" At a campaign rally in Sparks, Nevada on Oct. 29, 2015, Trump said: ""The marijuana thing is such a big thing. I think medical should happen — right? Don’t we agree? I think so. And then I really believe we should leave it up to the states. It should be a state situation ... but I believe that the legalization of marijuana – other than for medical because I think medical, you know I know people that are very, very sick and for whatever reason the marijuana really helps them - … but in terms of marijuana and legalization, I think that should be a state issue, state-by-state.""  Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Sparks, Nevada in October 2015 about marijuana legalization. Trump’s comment at the Sparks rally was also recorded in a Washington Post news article at the time with the headline ""Trump softens position on marijuana legalization."" A different view? Newsom’s spokesman did not include a fourth high-profile example where Trump discussed legal pot, one that somewhat contradicts Trump’s other comments on the topic. In an interview with Trump on Fox News on Feb. 11, 2016, host Bill O’Reilly described Colorado’s experience legalizing pot as leading to ""... all of the dealers, all of the pushers are going to Colorado, loading up on the free pot because it’s legal, not free -- legal and then zooming around the country selling it. Does that concern you?"" Trump responded saying he favors medical marijuana ""100 percent."" ""But what you are talking about (with recreational marijuana), perhaps not. It's causing a lot of problems out there,"" Trump added. Trump doesn’t bring up states rights in this interview. But in his subsequent interviews, with the Michigan radio station in March 2016 and the Colorado television station in July 2016, he returns to his line that states should decide the matter. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has strongly opposed marijuana legalization. He told reporters on Feb. 27, 2017 that: ""States they can pass the laws they choose. I would just say it does remain a violation of federal law to distribute marijuana throughout any place in the United States, whether a state legalizes it or not."" Long before running for president, Trump voiced strong opinions on drug legalization. In April 1990 in an article in the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, Trump said the United States should legalize drugs and use the money collected to educate the public on the dangers of drug use. ""We're losing badly the war on drugs,"" Trump said at the time, according to the article. ""You have to legalize drugs to win that war. You have to take the profit away from these drug czars."" Our ruling California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom recently claimed Donald Trump, during his campaign for president, ""committed to honoring states' rights when it comes to marijuana legalization."" In at least three campaign interviews, Trump said he thought the issue of legalizing marijuana should be left to the states. This wasn’t one of Trump’s high-profile promises like building a wall on the Southern border. And he did not address marijuana in his major campaign speeches. But he did make clear, multiple times, how he felt when asked. In a separate interview on Fox News, Trump expressed concern over legal pot in Colorado. But in two subsequent interviews he returned to his line that the matter should be decided by the states. In the end, Trump’s own words back Newsom’s claim",True,"February 28, 2017"
"""In one Colorado hospital, 50 percent of newborns tested had marijuana in their system.""","The last-minute contributions opposing an initiative that would legalize recreational marijuana in Arizona continue to pile up, with even Las Vegas billionaire Sheldon Adelson shelling out $500,000 against the cause. Much like the money, the ads against recreational marijuana continue to flow as well. An Oct. 11 ad from Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy, an anti-pot group, uses testimonies from two former Colorado politicians in highlighting the supposed dangers of recreational marijuana. ""In one Colorado hospital, 50 percent of newborns tested had marijuana in their system,"" former Denver Mayor Wellington Webb says. This claim stood out to us right away. Could half of all newborn babies tested at this particular hospital really have marijuana in their system? Deceptive data The ad cites a September 2016 report from the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area -- an interagency group focused on combating drug trafficking. According to the report, ""nearly half"" of newborns tested in March 2016 at St. Mary-Corwin Medical Center in Pueblo, Colo., tested positive for marijuana. Ciara Archer, a spokeswoman for the anti-pot group, also pointed us to a July 2016 CBS Denver story on the hospital. The article notes that the head of the neonatal unit, Dr. Steve Simerville, is reporting a ""dramatic increase"" in newborns with marijuana in their system. We reached out to the hospital and dug into the numbers. Colorado legalized recreational marijuana in 2012, but St. Mary-Corwin spokeswoman Wendi Dammann said babies have been drug tested at the hospital for at least a decade. ""The screening criteria was developed by both local hospitals (St. Mary-Corwin and Parkview) and Children’s Hospital Colorado,"" she said. As far as the numbers cited in the ad, Dammann confirmed that five out of the 11 newborn babies tested in March 2016 did test positive for marijuana. So that’s less than 46 percent -- not half -- of a handful of births in one month. Cherry-picking one month of data makes the number of newborns who test positive for marijuana seem higher than it actually is. That is not the case. From January 2016 through September 2016, 403 babies were born at St. Mary-Corwin. About one-quarter of those, or 101, were tested for marijuana. Of those 101 newborns, 27 tested positive for marijuana in their systems. That’s a rate slightly under 27 percent. And in 2015, the hospital saw 519 births. Of the 93 newborn babies tested for marijuana, 31 came up positive for marijuana. That’s a rate of 33 percent. Marijuana use during and after pregnancy can be quite harmful. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, exposure to THC ""could have profound and long-lasting consequences"" to a baby’s brain and behavior, including neurological development.   We wanted to know how these statistics compared to the country or states where marijuana is not legal, but we could not find much research on that point.   However, Dr. Edith Allen of Phoenix Children’s Hospital, studied drug habits for pregnant women with criteria including personal or family history of drug use at St. Joseph’s Hospital and Medical Center between 2006 and 2010. Her study found THC in 431 babies out of 727 mother-baby pairings tested -- almost 60 percent. However, Allen pointed out that not every pregnant woman was tested. Our ruling The ad claimed, ""In one Colorado hospital, 50 percent of newborns tested had marijuana in their system."" That hospital -- St. Mary-Corwin Medical Center -- did have more than 45 percent of their newborn babies tested test positive for marijuana in their systems. The big issue with the talking point is it cherry-picks one month of data. Overall, from January 2015 through September 2016, almost 1 in 3 newborn babies tested for marijuana at St. Mary-Corwin came up positive for marijuana in their systems.

"Department of Veterans Affairs doctors ""are prohibited from recommending medical marijuana.""","The effort to legalize recreational marijuana in Arizona has seen millions of dollars in contributions opposing the initiative -- and political advertisements on both sides of the issue. A recent ad from the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, a pro-pot group, tells the story of a post-9/11 veteran, Bruce Laird, who was prescribed multiple drugs before he turned to medical marijuana to treat his post-traumatic stress disorder. ""VA doctors are prohibited from recommending medical marijuana,"" the Oct. 14 ad’s on-screen text reads, before urging a ""yes"" vote on recreational marijuana to help veterans. As we’ve noted previously, voters approved medical marijuana in November 2010. The first dispensary opened in December 2012. We wondered if the ad’s claim about U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs doctors checked out, especially given the continued delays for health care at the Phoenix VA Health Care System. Cannabis concessions The prohibition is outlined in the VA’s 2011 directive on medical marijuana. ""It is VHA policy to prohibit VA providers from completing forms seeking recommendations or opinions regarding a veteran’s participation in a state marijuana program.""   According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, marijuana is a Schedule I drug, which means it cannot be used for medical purposes and has high potential for abuse. The DEA has a five-schedule drug scale -- the higher the number, the less dangerous. However, 25 states have already legalized medical marijuana.   Dr. Andrew Saxon of the VA Puget Sound Health Care System in Seattle said federal health care systems have to obey federal laws. Marijuana is still illegal federally. However, a veteran could still receive VA health care -- as the 2011 directive notes -- and seek medical marijuana elsewhere. ""A military veteran who is eligible for VA health care cannot be refused those services if he/she is using medical marijuana authorized by a non-VA health care provider,"" Saxon said. Legislation on amending the VA’s policy has come up short. Earlier this year, an amendment to the VA’s budget bill would have allowed VA doctors to recommend medical marijuana to veterans in states where it’s legal. However, the amendment was removed from the spending bill, which eventually passed. Our ruling The ad claimed, ""VA doctors are prohibited from recommending medical marijuana."" That’s on the mark.

"Colorado saw ""increased incidents of emergency room visits by young people"" and ""increased incidents of driving while under the influence of marijuana"" following the legalization of recreational pot.","Asked about California’s effort to legalize recreational marijuana, Republican congressional candidate Scott Jones said the experiences in Colorado are a stark warning of what not to do. Jones is Sacramento County’s sheriff and is running against Democratic Rep. Ami Bera for the region’s 7th District Congressional seat. ""We can look to Colorado ... and look at the horrific results,"" Jones said during a debate this week between the two candidates in Sacramento. ""If you look at the increased incidents of emergency room visits by young people. If you look at the increased incidents of driving while under the influence of marijuana. All voters have to do is see what happened in Colorado to predict what’s going to happen here.""  Scott Jones makes his claim about marijuana at about the 10:20 minute mark in the video above. California voters in November will decide on Proposition 64, which would legalize recreational pot for those 21 and older. Both Jones and Bera oppose the measure. Several other states will also vote on legalizing recreational or medicinal marijuana on Election Day. Colorado voted to legalize marijuana in 2012 and the law went into effect in 2014. We wondered if Jones was right? Did Colorado see a spike in ER trips by young people and more cases of driving while stoned after it legalized pot? Our research The first part of Jones’ statement appears to be correct. Several studies document a rise in trips to Colorado emergency rooms by young people. As reported in the Denver Post in July, a study in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics found ""Colorado’s laws on labeling and child-resistant packaging have been unable to stop an increase of young kids ending up in the emergency room after accidentally consuming marijuana."" The study found ""... cases for pediatric marijuana increased significantly and at a higher rate than the rest of the United States."" Examining Jones’ claim about an increase in incidents of driving while under the influence of marijuana was more complex. There’s not much data yet on the topic because the state only started tracking marijuana-related traffic incidents in 2014, according to a Colorado State Patrol spokesman quoted in the Denver Post last year. Jones’ campaign manager pointed us to a Colorado State Patrol report showing mixed results. It says the percentage of DUIs in the state where marijuana or marijuana in combination with alcohol or other drugs was the perceived impairing substance increased from 12 percent in 2014 to 15 percent in 2015. The same report, however, shows the raw number of citations for DUIs involving marijuana or marijuana in combination with other drugs dropped slightly during the same two years, from 674 to 665. A separate Colorado study pointed to by Jones’ campaign reported there’s been an increase in the percentage of drivers testing positive for marijuana involved in fatal traffic accidents. Making things more cloudy, however, that report includes a note from the Colorado State Patrol that ""marijuana citations"" are defined as those where marijuana was present ""based on officer opinion only,"" noting there’s ""no toxicological confirmation."" Radley Balko, who blogs about criminal justice for the Washington Post, wrote in 2014 that a spike in the number of drivers who are tested and found to have traces of marijuana in their system would not be a surprise in Colorado, nor would it mean marijuana necessarily contributed to a traffic accident. ""All that a positive test tells us is that the driver has smoked pot at some point in the past few days or weeks,"" Balko wrote, noting the drug can linger in a person’s system for days after its effects wear off. ""It makes sense that loosening restrictions on pot would result in a higher percentage of drivers involved in fatal traffic accidents having smoked the drug at some point over the past few days or weeks,"" Balko added. Our ruling Scott Jones said Colorado saw ""increased incidents of emergency room visits by young people"" and ""increased incidents of driving while under the influence of marijuana"" following the state’s legalization of recreational marijuana. Studies show the state indeed experienced a spike in ER visits by young people related to marijuana. Less clear is how marijuana-related traffic incidents have changed since the state legalized the drug. Studies have limited data and show mixed results. Further complicating the matter, marijuana can remain in a driver’s system days after the effect of the drug has worn off, making it difficult to determine whether the drug was the primary factor in an accident. Jones’ statement on the ER visits is accurate. But there’s not enough convincing data to prove the second portion of his claim",Half True,"October 19, 2016"
"Says Colorado congressional candidate Morgan Carroll ""voted to allow welfare recipients to use your tax dollars at ATMs at strip clubs and pot dispensaries.""","A Republican group has launched a racy ad saying Colorado state Sen. Morgan Carroll, a Democratic congressional candidate, voted to allow welfare recipients to use public benefit cards at ATMs in strip clubs and marijuana dispensaries. The National Republican Congressional Committee’s ad shows how down and dirty the race between Carroll and Republican incumbent Rep. Mike Coffman is getting in the final sprint to Election Day. They’re fighting over suburban Denver’s 6th Congressional District, one of the nation’s most competitive swing districts. ""Career politicians waste lots of money. Morgan Carroll is one of the worst,"" the narrator says at the beginning of the ad, titled ""Clubs."" ""Carroll voted to allow welfare recipients to use your tax dollars at ATMs at strip clubs and pot dispensaries,"" the narrator continues as the video shifts from Carroll addressing the Legislature to her standing at a podium in front of a red neon silhouette of a nude female figure and the words ""STRIPPERS"" and ""MORGAN CARROLL"" on a brick wall. There's a row of marijuana-filled jars beside the senator. ""It's enough to make you ask, 'What's Morgan Carroll thinking?' Welfare for lap dances? Morgan Carroll is careless with our money,"" the ad concludes. We examined the claim that ""Carroll voted to allow welfare recipients to use your tax dollars at ATMs at strip clubs and pot dispensaries."" The facts are fairly straightforward. Carroll was among a dozen Democratic senators who voted against final passage of a 2015 bill to prohibit welfare recipients from using state-issued electronic benefit transfer (or EBT) cards to obtain cash from ATMs at pot shops and strip clubs. Low-income families use these debit cards to buy ""essential goods"" such as food and clothing and to help pay for utilities and rent. Senate Bill 65, which became law, expanded on existing state law prohibiting people from using the cards to withdraw ATM cash at liquor stores, casinos and gun shops. Federal law already required states to prevent people receiving public benefits from using EBT cards at liquor stores, gambling and adult entertainment venues. Colorado also has had trouble preventing people from withdrawing ATM cash totalling hundreds of thousands of dollars at casinos and liquor stores, according to Watchdog.org. State officials and lawmakers warned that Colorado would face financial sanctions for failing to comply with federal prohibitions against EBT card use at strip clubs. There were also concerns about a federal crackdown after several reports of people using the benefit cards at shops selling medical or recreational marijuana -- a drug that’s legal under state law but illegal under federal law. ""We stand to lose a lot if we don't show we are trying"" to prevent the use of tax money for marijuana, Republican Sen. Vicki Marble, a primary sponsor of the bill, told the Associated Press last year. ""The growers here put in a lot of time and effort. A raid would be absolutely devastating to our state."" Why did Carroll -- along with many other Democratic senators -- vote against the bill? ""The reason she voted against it was because of 'banking deserts,' where many poor people don't have"" bank ATMs in their neighborhoods, said Carroll campaign spokesman Drew Godinich. Removing their ability to get cash from ATMs at the many marijuana dispensaries that dot Colorado cities and towns hampers low-income families’ ability to access money to purchase legitimate products elsewhere, he added.   According to the Atlantic magazine, a March study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on the increase of ""banking deserts"" found that ""lower-income communities and communities of color have historically and disproportionately limited access to mainstream banking services."" This makes it harder for people in these communities to manage their finances and build wealth, the study said. Democratic lawmakers had repeatedly defeated similar legislation, arguing that improper ATM withdrawals at strip clubs, liquor stores, casinos represent a tiny fraction of the total use of cash-assistance cards, the Denver Post reported. Critics also note that the 2015 law doesn't prevent someone on welfare from using their EBT card to make a withdrawal at a supermarket ATM and then go spend the cash at a pot shop or a strip club. Our ruling NRCC says, ""Carroll voted to allow welfare recipients to use your tax dollars at ATMs at strip clubs and pot dispensaries."" There's slightly more to this than the NRCC lets on: Carroll voted, unsuccessfully, to allow welfare recipients to continue withdrawing money from ATMs at strip clubs and pot dispensaries.  Carroll’s spokesman said the senator voted against the bill that prohibited people from using public benefit cards for cash withdrawals at strip clubs and marijuana dispensaries because she was concerned about the impact on residents of poor neighborhoods where there are few -- if any -- banking services. State officials and lawmakers warned that Colorado could face financial sanctions for failing to comply with federal prohibitions against the use of benefit cards at adult entertainment venues",Mostly True,"October 13, 2016"
"Says marijuana use among Colorado high school students ""has not increased since legalization.""","Colorado has been the measuring stick for both supporters and opponents of an initiative to legalize recreational marijuana in Arizona this November. A recent ad from the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, a pro-marijuana group, attempts to show the positive effects of marijuana regulation in Colorado, highlighting millions of dollars going toward public education and the lack of an increase in pot use among teens. ""According to the Colorado state government, marijuana use among high school students has not increased since legalization,"" the ad, which started airing Sept. 27, claims. We should also note that the anti-pot camp has used Colorado teen pot statistics in their ads. Colorado legalized recreational marijuana in 2012. The first retail store opened in January 2014. We have seen multiple numbers on teen pot use, so we wondered if this claim held up. Barrett Marson, a spokesman with the pro-marijuana campaign, pointed us to the 2015 Healthy Kids Colorado Survey. The ad cites a June 2016 Denver Post article, which references the survey. This survey, which takes place every two years, is done by the Colorado Department of Health and Environment. The 2015 version surveys about 17,000 middle and high school students at random. According to the results, 38 percent of high school students surveyed said they used marijuana at least once their life. In 2013, that number was 36.9 percent. The 2015 survey also noted that 21.2 percent of high-schoolers used marijuana in the last 30 days. That number was 19.7 percent in 2013. However, the stats are not significant, according to multiple experts we spoke with. This means the data has wiggle room. ""There was not a statistically significant increase in 30-day or lifetime marijuana use among high school students between 2013 and 2015,"" said Mark Salley, a spokesman with Colorado’s health department. The state’s top health official, Dr. Larry Wolk, said the same thing in December 2015 when looking at federal data -- from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health -- on the topic. The national survey notes that 11.16 percent of Colorado 12- to 17-year-olds in the 2012-13 cycle used marijuana in the last 30 days . That number was 12.56 percent in the 2013-14 cycle. ""This is not a statistically significant increase at the 5 percent level of significance,"" said Brad Stone, a spokesman with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Jonathan Caulkins, a public policy professor at Carnegie Mellon University, said the clock hasn’t even really started on the full effects of legalizing recreational marijuana. ""We’re not going to see the full effects of legalization until something like 25 years after national legalization,"" Caulkins said. ""It takes time for the industry to adapt to new opportunities, go through the usual shake-out period."" Our rating The ad claimed, ""according to the Colorado state government, marijuana use among high school students has not increased since legalization."" Based on the numbers cited, there does appear to have been a slight increase in marijuana use among Colorado’s high school students.

They also said it was too early to draw conclusions about marijuana use, and that more years of study will be needed",Half True,"October 6, 2016"
"Says Proposition 205 ""blocks market entry"" for new marijuana dispensaries.","Arizona is one of five states where voters will decide whether to legalize recreational marijuana this November. Our partners at ABC15 have reported on the weed effort in Arizona, noting that individual, anti-weed contributions outnumber pro-weed contributions almost four to one. A Sept. 15 attack ad from an anti-marijuana group, Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy, portrays the potential passage of Proposition 205, which would legalize recreational marijuana, as a monopoly for existing medical marijuana dispensaries. ""Prop. 205 is a 20-page special interest goldmine that elevates the rights of users over the public,"" the ad’s narration claims. ""(It) blocks market entry for new dispensaries."" The first medical marijuana dispensary in Arizona opened in December 2012 after voters approved the act in November 2010. But, we wondered, would new dispensaries hoping to sell legal, recreational pot not be able to do so under this initiative? The state’s Health Services Department currently regulates medical marijuana in Arizona. If Prop. 205 passes, a new state agency, the Arizona Department of Marijuana Licenses and Control, would regulate both recreational and medical marijuana. Part of this would be done through a seven-member Marijuana Commission within the new agency, which would approve and deny licenses. Ciara Archer, a spokeswoman for Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy, said existing medical marijuana dispensaries are given preference to become retail marijuana outlets. ""Newcomers to the market cannot even apply for licenses until after Dec. 17, 2017, nearly a full year after medical marijuana business owners can apply and have licenses awarded to them,"" Archer said. But that is not the same thing as an outright block on new dispensaries. Will Humble, a health policy expert at the University of Arizona, said the new agency still has to set several rules if Prop. 205 passes, including how much pot each retail store can produce, as well as a cap on the number of stores permitted. ""While the existing medical marijuana dispensaries would have a distinct advantage to becoming a retail store, it’s not a total blocked entry. The Prop. 205 cap is 147 dispensaries,"" Humble said. According to Humble, the agency could also add an undetermined number of new stores to ""meet demand"" in 2021.  Barrett Marson, a spokesman with the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, a pro-marijuana group, said there is ""certainly growth"" for new licenses in the initiative. Moreover, according to the initiative’s language, the new agency would not set rules on recreational marijuana until September 2017. Our ruling The ad claims Prop. 205 ""blocks market entry for new dispensaries.""

"""Amendment 2 will bring kid-friendly pot candy to Florida.""","Opponents of Florida’s medical marijuana amendment are warning that cannabis-enhanced edibles will endanger children, hoping that voters will eat up their dire predictions and reject the measure. ""Amendment 2 will bring kid-friendly pot candy to Florida,"" the anti-drug campaign Vote No On 2 said in a flier we received in the mail Sept. 22, 2016. The campaign is run by the Drug Free Florida Committee, an anti-drug group started in 2014 by longtime GOP fundraiser Mel Sembler and his wife, Betty, with financial backing from casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. We wanted to find out whether the medical marijuana amendment allows ""pot candy,"" and whether it really would be ""kid-friendly."" Candy plan As a quick refresher, Amendment 2 would let doctors recommend medical marijuana for patients with a host of certain conditions, including cancer, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease and more. It’s only a recommendation, because marijuana still is illegal under federal law, so doctors can’t prescribe it and pharmacists can’t distribute it. The patients would take their recommendations to what is referred to as a Medical Marijuana Treatment Center, which would be regulated by the state to provide the drug. Here’s where we get into Vote No On 2’s assertion about pot candy. The amendment language says the following (emphasis ours): "" ‘Medical Marijuana Treatment Center’ (MMTC) means an entity that acquires, cultivates, possesses, processes (including development of related products such as food, tinctures, aerosols, oils, or ointments), transfers, transports, sells, distributes, dispenses, or administers marijuana, products containing marijuana, related supplies, or educational materials to qualifying patients or their caregivers and is registered by the Department."" So while the amendment doesn’t specifically mention candy, it does allow edibles. Proponents argue that edible forms of marijuana are better for some patients, in part because the effects can be longer-lasting than other methods of ingestion. That’s also part of the problem, because it can be difficult to gauge how the drug may affect people when eaten instead of smoked. Vote No On 2 cites an uptick of children being hospitalized in many of those states for eating marijuana-laced candy, which they say is tempting to kids if left out. They pointed to several news stories about children in medical marijuana states consuming cookies, chocolate bars, brownies and other sweets and candies. In some of their cases it wasn’t apparent if the candy was medical marijuana or from some other source. (It’s also possible that people could always just buy cannabis in bud form and make their own edibles.) Ben Pollara, director of United for Care, the group behind the amendment, said Vote No On 2 was creating a ""total dystopian fantasy about the way the amendment could be implemented."" He said a child getting into an adult’s medical marijuana presents the same issues as any medication, and it was up to the adult to prevent accidents from happening. ""Put it away,"" he said. ""That’s Parenting 101."" Kate Bell, legislative counsel at the Marijuana Policy Project, which supports the amendment, said 19 of the 25 medical marijuana states allow edibles, although they all handle them a bit differently. Amendment 2 offers the state plenty of leeway on how it could regulate the marijuana industry. The Legislature would have to pass a law on the issue and the Department of Health would have to write the regulations. What those rules would specifically say is anyone’s guess, and the health department told us that they couldn’t speculate. A health department spokeswoman pointed out that under current Florida law allowing medical marijuana for some epileptics and terminal patients, the only prohibited form is smoking, which Amendment 2 would allow. That leaves us to look to see how other states handle guidelines about things like packaging and sales practices. Washington, for example, bans products designed to appeal to kids. Connecticut requires tamper-resistant packages just like prescription drugs. California, which is phasing in new regulations, requires labels warning patients to keep products away from children. New Jersey only allows edibles in lozenge form, which were previously only available to child patients to take at school. (There’s an overview of guidelines for each state here.) In Colorado, which started selling medical marijuana in 2001 and recreational marijuana in 2012, there has been an increase in the number of children hospitalized for ingesting marijuana. A spokeswoman for the state’s marijuana enforcement division acknowledged in 2014 that edible forms carry ""a significant public safety risk."" Colorado this year banned some products shaped like people, fruit or animals. The state also requires opaque, tamper-resistant packaging and a label announcing the content of THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. The state also is starting to use a universal symbol designating a marijuana product. That doesn’t mean kids don’t end up getting exposed to the drug. Mike Van Dyke, the chief of environmental epidemiology, occupational health and toxicology at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said the state continues to adapt its packaging policies to make edible marijuana less accessible to children. A Colorado report on the amount of emergency room visits and hospitalizations for marijuana exposure shows the number of affected children under 9  — when use is more likely to be accidental — has increased over the last 15 years. But Van Dyke says they still are small numbers. In 2000, prior to medical marijuana being legalized, only 1 child was hospitalized statewide. In 2014-15, there were 37 ER visits and 15 hospitalizations. There’s also been an increase among people older than 9, too, but there are caveats to the data. Hospitals record these as exposures, but they don’t necessarily specify how patients were exposed, or if they were at the hospital because of the exposure or for a related issue. ""We’ve definitely seen an increase, but a lot of people are inflating the impact of these cases,"" Van Dyke said. ""Prior to 2010, we didn’t have commercially available, edible marijuana products, so of course there’s going to be more instances with an increase in availability."" The Journal of the American Medical Association this year published a study of marijuana exposures in Colorado for kids younger than 10. It found between 2009 and 2015, children’s hospital visits increased from 1.2 to 2.3 per 100,000. The Washington Post noted that means hospitals and poison control centers are much more likely to get calls about diaper cream, toothpaste, laundry detergent and crayons than they are about marijuana. Our ruling Vote No On 2 said, ""Amendment 2 will bring kid-friendly pot candy to Florida."" The proposal would allow edible forms of marijuana, but the amendment does not specifically identify candy. Calling it ""kid-friendly"" plays on parents’ fears without any proof that’s what will happen.  The statement is partially accurate but requires additional context",Half True,"September 30, 2016"
"""Sixty percent of Americans now support legalizing marijuana.""","In a TV interview during a campaign visit to Milwaukee, Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson was asked about his support for the legalization of marijuana. He replied by making a claim we want to check. ""And let’s see, 60 percent of Americans now support legalizing marijuana,"" Johnson said on the Sept. 4, 2016 edition of the ""Upfront with Mike Gousha"" public affairs show on WISN (Channel 12). Only a month earlier, the former Republican governor of New Mexico had made a less aggressive claim, saying ""most"" Americans supported legalization. PolitiFact National’s rating was True, as multiple polls generally showed support in the low 50s. It seems unlikely that in a few short weeks it would jump to 60 percent. But let’s take a look. Previous factcheck When Johnson made his earlier claim, our colleagues found that in 12 of 14 national polls taken since the start of 2014, 50 percent or more of Americans supported legalization. The information, covering a period of more than 2.5 years, was taken from the PollingReport.com database As for the other two polls, legalization led in one by 48 percent to 47 percent and in the other by 49 percent to 48 percent. In the three latest polls in the database, the numbers crept closer to 60 percent, with support at 54 percent, 56 percent and 58 percent. But averaging the 14 polls, legalization led 53 percent to 44 percent. Another poll Johnson’s campaign, however, pointed us to another relatively recent poll that wasn’t included in the database. The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll, conducted in February 2016, found that 61 percent of Americans said the use of marijuana should be made legal. (Interestingly, 53 percent said marijuana use in their communities was a moderately serious, very serious or extremely serious problem, compared to 45 percent who said it was not at all serious or not too serious.) Reporting on the poll, the Washington Post’s Wonkblog said the 61 percent support, a notch above Johnson’s claim, was an all-time high. A parting note, though it doesn’t bear on our rating of Johnson’s claim about national numbers:   In a July 2016 poll of registered voters in Wisconsin, the Marquette Law School Poll asked: When it comes to marijuana, some people think that the drug should be fully legalized and regulated like alcohol. Do you agree or disagree with that view? The results: 59 percent agreed, 39 percent disagreed.
  Our rating Johnson said: ""Sixty percent of Americans now support legalizing marijuana."" A March 2016 poll found 61 percent support, but that is the only recent survey we could find showing support that high.

"""Medical-grade marijuana alone will not get that patient ‘high,’ no matter what level of THC, CBD or any other compound is found in the plant.""","Medical marijuana has many uses, according to supporters of Florida’s Amendment 2, but getting high is not one of them. Kim McCray, outreach director for United for Care, said in an Aug. 11 South Florida Times op-ed that the well-known euphoric effects of cannabis aren’t an issue. ""What is also important to know is that although some debilitated patients may require higher levels of THC than others based on their specific medical condition, medical-grade marijuana alone, will not get that patient ‘high,’ no matter what level of THC, CBD or any other compound is found in the plant,"" McCray wrote. She pointed out that medical cannabis can not only be smoked, but be packaged as ointments, oils, pills and skin patches. It sounded peculiar to us to say that medical marijuana can’t get you high, regardless of the chemical content. We checked with some experts to clear the air. Doctor’s orders Florida voters will decide in November 2016 whether to allow medical marijuana in the state. The proposed constitutional amendment would allow patients with cancer, HIV/AIDS, epilepsy, glaucoma, post-traumatic stress disorder, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis ""or other debilitating medical conditions of the same kind or class as or comparable to those enumerated"" to obtain cannabis with a doctor’s recommendation. What the system would truly look like is still anyone’s guess, because the amendment leaves most of the details up to the state Legislature and state health department. Patients would get a state-registered ID card that would allow them to get their marijuana, but the how, when and where of it wouldn’t be decided until the amendment passes.   Also unknown is just what kind of ""medical-grade marijuana"" will be available. Amendment 2 doesn’t place restrictions on what forms of cannabis the state could allow, including cannabis in its smokable form. To understand the types of marijuana or marijuana products we’re talking about, we need a quick chemistry lesson. Cannabis contains roughly 500 compounds, 70 of which are psychoactive. THC, or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, is the main psychoactive ingredient in the marijuana plant. The level of THC in a plant varies based on the strain, the part of the plant used, and how it is processed for consumption. Also present is a substance called cannabidiol, known as CBD, which is an antioxidant and has properties that are thought to protect the brain. It’s also not psychoactive like THC.   Florida’s 2014 law approved low-THC cannabis oil or vapor products containing CBD for patients with muscle spasms, cancer, epilepsy and terminal illnesses. Fifteen other states have similar laws. Even the National Institute on Drug Abuse says CBD may prove useful in treating epilepsy as well as inflammation and mental illnesses or addictions. Products like cannabis oil are made from strains of marijuana already bred to be high in CBD and low in THC, although THC still is a part of the equation. Research shows that compound is what brings CBD into the brain. Now for how this applies to McCray’s statement. United for Care spokeswoman Bianca Garza said McCray meant to dispel the notion that medical marijuana patients obtain their medicine for the sole purpose of feeling its well-known euphoric effects. ""The point being made in the statement is that doctors and patients will decide on a care plan that will enable them to become more normal,"" Garza said in an email. ""In other words, they'll decide on a dosage appropriate for their debilitating condition to feel less pain, to have fewer seizures and spasms, etc. It will be decided by a Florida licensed physician and will not lead to patients being ‘high.’ "" Essentially, their argument is one of semantics: Medical marijuana patients won’t be getting stoned, they’ll be using medication under the supervision of a doctor as a form of treatment. That precludes the idea that patients will just be taking marijuana as a recreational drug, although Garza conceded that ""like any medicine, there’s the possibility for abuse."" United for Care’s point of view still doesn’t mean some forms of medical marijuana aren’t capable of getting patients baked. Marijuana still has physiological effects, whether it’s doctor-approved or not. Dr. David Casarett, a professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and author of the book Stoned: A Doctor's Case for Medical Marijuana, said that low-THC strains or oils that have only CBD don’t produce the same buzzed feeling as a joint. But higher-THC marijuana still ""will most certainly get you high,"" he said. ""Just calling something ‘medical grade’ won't prevent you from getting high,"" Casarett said. ""It's like alcohol. Laboratory grade ethanol will get you just as drunk as home-brewed moonshine with the same alcohol content."" Our ruling A representative of United for Care said, ""Medical-grade marijuana alone will not get that patient ‘high,’ no matter what level of THC, CBD or any other compound is found in the plant."" The group said McKay is referring to the controlled conditions under which medical marijuana would be monitored by doctors for use by patients. But her word choice could easily lead to misunderstanding. While there are non-euphoric strains of cannabis that are already being used as treatments for some conditions, it’s not accurate to say that no form of medical marijuana will get you high. High-THC medical cannabis will still produce the same intoxicating effects as the street form of the drug will",Mostly False,"August 19, 2016"
"""Most Americans support"" the legalization of marijuana.","In a Medium post touting his Libertarian presidential candidacy, former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson addressed a variety of policies in his platform, including fiscally conservative policies, criminal justice reform and caution before committing troops overseas. He also returned to what has become one of his signature issues: the legalization of marijuana. ""In 1999, I became the only sitting governor to publicly advocate the legalization of marijuana,"" he wrote. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who ran for president in 2016, ""came to that viewpoint — a position that most Americans support — 16 years later."" We wondered: Is Johnson correct that ""most Americans support"" the ""legalization of marijuana""? We took a look at the recent polling and found that Johnson is basically on target. It wasn’t always the case: As recently as 2005, public opinion was roughly 2-to-1 against marijuana legalization. But we found 14 polls since the beginning of 2014 that show consistent support for legalization. (The poll questions used the broad term ""legalization"" without providing specifics about how the drug would be sold or whether there would be restrictions on how it could be used.) Here’s a full list of those 14 polls since the start of 2014, drawn from the public opinion archive PollingReport.com: In 12 of these 14 polls, an outright majority of respondents -- 50 percent or more -- supported legalization. As for the other two polls, legalization led in one by 48 percent to 47 percent and in the other by 49 percent to 48 percent. Overall, if you average the 14 polls, legalization led by a 53 percent-44 percent margin. Joe Hunter, the communications director for Johnson and his running mate, former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, said the ""most reliable data, when available, is derived from asking the same question over time, with the same methodology. Of the major polling organizations, Gallup is the one who has done that."" During the time frame we looked at, Gallup asked the question twice, once finding an 18-point edge for legalization and the other time finding a four-point margin. The most recent Gallup poll before that, taken in 2013, found a 19-point lead for legalization. Our ruling Johnson said that ""most Americans support"" the ""legalization of marijuana.""

"""Because there's no local option to allow communities to ban, limit or restrict the location of pot shops, if Amendment 2 passes you can expect the seedy elements of the pot industry to move in right next door to your neighborhood, your church, your business and even your child's school.""","Local governments will be powerless to prevent medical marijuana dispensaries from sprouting up anywhere and everywhere should Amendment 2 pass this fall, opponents of the measure say. A pamphlet from Vote No On 2 mailed to voters in July warns that the constitutional amendment prevents any kinds of restrictions on the locations of marijuana-related businesses. The amendment would allow doctors to recommend medical marijuana for certain health conditions and patients to pick up the drug from dispensaries that sell it. ""Because there's no local option to allow communities to ban, limit or restrict the location of pot shops, if Amendment 2 passes you can expect the seedy elements of the pot industry to move in right next door to your neighborhood, your church, your business and even your child's school,"" the pamphlet cautions. Vote No On 2 is a campaign run by the Drug Free Florida Committee, an anti-drug group started in 2014 by longtime GOP fundraiser Mel Sembler and his wife, Betty, with financial backing from casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. We wanted to know whether Amendment 2 prevented communities from their own bans on so-called ""pot shops."" The short answer is that the amendment does not have any provisions for local legislation — but that’s only because the state would eventually be deciding whether local jurisdictions could do that. Amendment 2 redux First, let’s recall that Amendment 2 hit the ballot first in 2014, but just missed the 60 percent of the vote needed to pass. The current version for the November 2016 ballot has the same name, but United for Care, the group behind the measure, has altered the language for November 2016 to clear up confusion about the prior proposal. The amendment now requires parental consent and doctor certification for minors and more clearly defines the medical conditions it covers: cancer, HIV/AIDS, epilepsy, glaucoma, post-traumatic stress disorder, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis ""or other debilitating medical conditions of the same kind or class as or comparable to those enumerated,"" with a doctor’s recommendation. That means that if a doctor recommends medical marijuana for a patient with one of these conditions, the patient (or a certified caregiver) will get a state-issued ID card. That card allows them to buy marijuana at a state-regulated dispensary. There are some things to keep in mind about the whole process. Doctors are only recommending cannabis, because it’s illegal under federal law to prescribe a Schedule I drug — meaning it’s considered highly addictive and has no known medical benefits. Doctors would risk losing their ability to practice medicine if they prescribe marijuana. Pharmacies also can’t legally distribute cannabis, making dispensaries necessary. Dispensary suspense The state has estimated there could be almost 2,000 medical marijuana dispensaries in Florida should Amendment 2 pass, though there may be far fewer than that in reality. The proposed amendment requires the Legislature and the health department to figure out all the details of implementing medical marijuana should the measure pass — including the number of dispensaries and where they’re allowed to be. Vote No on 2 spokeswoman Christina Johnson pointed out to us that Amendment 2 does not include any language about a local option, and therefore doesn’t guarantee the state will allow them. The group believes that if a community passes an ordinance, the issue will have to be settled in court due to the amendment’s wording, and a right to access will trump local law. But the amendment also doesn’t prevent the state from letting local jurisdictions create their own rules. While no one knows exactly what will happen, chances are good that there will be some leeway for local rules. Kate Bell, legislative counsel for the Marijuana Policy Project, said it wouldn’t be appropriate for an amendment to try to codify regulations into the state’s constitution. Instead, regulations would have to spell out specifics, such as setbacks from schools and how dispensaries must follow local zoning laws. If the state doesn’t make distinct rules about dispensaries, local zoning rules would likely apply. The examples from other laws vary, as all 25 medical marijuana states (plus the District of Columbia) differ in their regulations. In New York, a rule says dispensaries can’t be within 1,000 feet of a ""school, church, synagogue or other place of worship."" In Washington, D.C., a dense urban area, dispensaries and cultivation centers where marijuana is grown may be no closer than 300 feet of a ""preschool, primary or secondary school, or recreation center."" Ordinances could be shaped into de facto bans, but there is some precedent for local governments being prevented from prohibiting dispensaries entirely. Maryland regulations say a licensed dispensary ""shall conform to all local zoning and planning requirements,"" but the state’s attorney general has said in an opinion that those rules can’t outright ban dispensaries. Arizona law says ""cities, towns and counties may enact reasonable zoning regulations that limit the use of land for registered nonprofit medical marijuana dispensaries to specified areas,"" but court rulings have said those laws can’t make opening a dispensary practically impossible. Pennsylvania’s law, passed earlier this year, prevented local ordinances from completely banning dispensaries. Andrew Livingston, a policy analyst for national law firm Vicente Sederberg, which represents marijuana businesses, said Florida is fairly unique in trying to pass a constitutional amendment with the expectation of marijuana storefronts. Nevada and Colorado passed constitutional amendments, and both allow local dispensary bans. He said almost all states that used voter-approved initiatives — like California, Oregon and Alaska — made the decision before the idea of dispensaries became popular. Those states focused on allowing patients or caregiver to grow their own plants, not buy them through state-approved dispensaries. ""There were no reasons to ban marijuana businesses because marijuana businesses were never mentioned in these earliest laws,"" Livingston said. There is no provision in the Florida amendment for patients to grow their own plants. As for Florida, we don’t have to wait to see whether towns or counties will create their own laws shunning medical marijuana. It’s already happening, in part because of a 2014 law allowing low-THC cannabis products for patients with muscle spasms, cancer, epilepsy and terminal illnesses. More than two dozen cities have regulated or completely banned medical marijuana sales. Boca Raton, for example, has a moratorium on medical marijuana dispensaries, cultivation, processing or distribution until city zoning rules are ironed out. Pasco County has banned any type of marijuana business. And while cannabis is still illegal in Plant City, the city commission passed an ordinance on Aug. 8 in anticipation of Amendment 2 winning at the polls. If federal law one day changes, medical marijuana dispensaries would be allowed, but they still have to be at least 500 feet from schools, churches, daycares, drug treatment centers, public parks and residential areas. Any dispensaries also would be confined to an area smaller than four acres in the city, next to a hospital and a fried chicken restaurant.   Our ruling Vote No On 2 said, ""Because there's no local option to allow communities to ban, limit or restrict the location of pot shops, if Amendment 2 passes you can expect the seedy elements of the pot industry to move in right next door to your neighborhood, your church, your business and even your child's school."" While the statement is technically accurate about the amendment’s wording, it’s highly doubtful there will be a dispensary on every corner. If it passes, the state will be in charge of writing regulations, including whether and how local jurisdictions will be able to create their own zoning laws or ordinances. It’s impossible to say with certainty what Florida’s regulations on dispensaries would look like should the amendment pass, as regulations in other medical marijuana states vary. But local bans or restrictive laws on dispensaries are common in medical marijuana states.

"Legal prescription drugs ""statistically kill 100,000 people a year, (but) there are no documented deaths due to marijuana.""","Gary Johnson, the libertarian 2016 presidential candidate, recently assailed strict federal regulations on marijuana, saying that the drug causes far less harm when compared with legal drugs. Johnson was asked about the potential public health dangers of marijuana in states where it was recently legalized, during a CNN libertarian town hall on Aug. 3, 2016. He responded by arguing that the drug hasn’t actually killed anyone, and that prescription drugs are far more dangerous. ""I just think that so much research and development needs to take place that hasn't taken place. And that marijuana products deal -- or compete directly with legal prescription drugs that statistically kill 100,000 people a year, and there are no documented deaths due to marijuana.""

Many supporters of marijuana legalization like to say that the drug poses no grave risks to a person’s health, but how does it actually compare with prescription drugs in terms of death statistics? We decided to dive into the data to find out. Clearing up the contextual smoke One immediate problem with Johnson’s claim is that it leaves out important context about how a drug can actually kill someone. Drugs directly kill people through toxic overdoses, but they can also indirectly kill people by causing accidents. We’ll look at both cases for marijuana. (The Johnson campaign did not respond to requests for clarification.) We decided to look at direct overdose deaths first. It’s very difficult to overdose on marijuana’s active ingredient. A review study comparing the acute lethal toxicity of commonly abused drugs shows that the lethal dose for marijuana (around 15 grams or above) is at least 1,000 times greater than the effective dose (15 milligrams), or the dose required to achieve a noticeable effect. In contrast, alcohol can become lethal at only 10 times the effective dose. Additionally, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration drug sheet for marijuana reports that no deaths from marijuana overdose have ever been recorded. However, marijuana has played an indirect role in fatalities. Experts that we talked with agreed that the drug itself doesn’t cause major acute health problems and is far safer than other medications. However, they said that it can still dangerously inhibit someone’s ability to make safe decisions. Dr. Ryan Vandrey, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University who specializes in the behavioral effects of marijuana, stressed that looking only at deaths from direct overdoses is a narrow way of examining a drug’s health effects. ""Too often individuals cite that individuals haven’t died from cannabis -- I don’t think that’s true. It certainly can be argued that cannabis use has contributed to the deaths of individuals, such as due to impairment during driving,"" he said. Dr. Jerome Avorn, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, told us, ""The main risk from marijuana is from the risky or stupid things people do after using it, such as driving, rather than from any toxic effects of the substance itself, which is remarkably safe."" A 2013 literature review article noted that higher levels of THC in the blood are associated with substantial driving impairment and a higher risk of accidents, especially when combined with moderate alcohol consumption. However, the authors emphasized that more research needs to be done on the issue. Other accidental deaths involve marijuana users who seemingly became out of touch with reality and took reckless actions. A report from 2015 detailed the case of a 19-year-old male who jumped off a balcony after consuming multiple servings of a marijuana cookie. The study suggests that a high enough dose of THC can result in a greater risk of ""adverse psychological effects."" In summary, it appears that marijuana doesn’t directly cause overdose deaths, but there are documented cases where it likely led to accidental fatalities.The exact number of marijuana-related deaths that occur annually is difficult to pin down. One more caveat: synthetic marijuana has been attributed to overdose deaths. However, the experts we talked with told us that these drugs have nothing to do with marijuana and are a completely different class of substances. How about prescription drugs? As with marijuana, Johnson was unclear about whether he was referring to only prescription drug overdoses or to all deaths associated with prescription drugs, such as though allergies or deadly complications. Deaths from prescription drug overdoses are very common in the United States. The National Institute of Drug Abuse’s website shows that approximately 25,000 people died from prescription drug overdoses in 2014. Around 19,000 of these deaths came from prescription opioid pain relievers such as methadone and oxycodone. But Johnson said that prescription drugs, ""statistically kill 100,000 people every year."" Where is he getting his data from? There’s a study from 1998 that showed there were over 100,000 fatal ""adverse drug reactions"" in hospital patients in the U.S. However, the study is 18 years old, and the National Institute for Drug Abuse told us that the study was based on invalid calculations that overestimated the number of deaths. Dr. Avorn emphasized that counting all deaths from prescription drugs is ""horrendously complicated,"" and that estimates vary wildly. A recent article in the New York Times pointed out how the interplay between a large number of potential causes of death makes it difficult to determine how many people die from improperly administered prescription drugs or other ""medical errors."" Although Johnson’s claim is difficult to verify, the data show that at least tens of thousands of people do die from prescription drugs yearly. Our ruling Johnson said that marijuana competes with ""legal prescription drugs that statistically kill 100,000 people a year and there are no documented deaths due to marijuana."" Marijuana is far less toxic than many prescription painkillers, which kill tens of thousands of people every year. Marijuana has never killed anyone through overdose, but Johnson’s vague claim leaves out the crucial fact that marijuana has played a role in accidental deaths. And the number of prescription drug deaths isn't estimated to be as high as Johnson said.  The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important context",True,"August 16, 2016"
"Says if you try to hide marijuana in a hemp field, ""it becomes worthless. The THC goes away.""","It may look like marijuana, but hemp cannot get you high. They’re forms of the same species, although hemp has a negligible amount of THC, the high-inducing chemical found in marijuana. Due to the plant's industrial and and agricultural uses, the General Assembly legalized hemp farming last year. Yet many lawmakers fear the hemp industry will provide cover for marijuana growing operations, since the two plants look similar. That argument came up again before the N.C. House overwhelmingly passed further regulations on the hemp industry on June 13. Rep. Larry Yarborough, a Republican from Roxboro, voted for those regulations. But he had previously said the using-hemp-to-hide-marijuana argument is flawed. If a marijuana plant ""gets the pollen (from hemp) and goes to seed, it becomes worthless,"" Yarborough said in a House Agriculture Committee Meeting a few days before the vote. ""The THC goes away."" That’s a pretty sweeping claim that would seem to debunk many concerns. We contacted Yarborough, a chemical engineer and business owner, to ask where he heard that. He backed off the quote a little bit. ""The plant with seed would be worthless in the market,"" he said. ""I don’t know for sure that all the THC would be gone but there would be very little, according to what I have read."" Unlike his original statement, that aligns with mainstream research. We spoke with two professors who have studied hemp in other states, and we read a 2015 report on hemp and marijuana compiled by the federal government. All came to the same conclusion: Anyone who tries to hide marijuana inside a hemp field isn’t a very smart criminal. Regulating hemp The new regulations passed the N.C. House by a vote of 108-3. Next up is a vote in the Senate. If they become law, they will limit the amount of land hemp can be grown on, require the location of all hemp fields to be disclosed to state and local law enforcement agencies, allow officials to inspect hemp fields at any time and make it a felony to use hemp to hide marijuana. Yarborough, who represents Granville and Person counties, said he just wanted legislators to know all the facts. ""I represent an agricultural community and I have constituents that want to grow industrial hemp and medical marijuana,"" he said. ""I am certainly not an advocate of legalizing marijuana, but I have constituents that are and farmers that want to grow it."" Why it won’t work As any experienced marijuana grower will tell you, according to the federal government’s Congressional Research Service, it’s imperative that pollen-producing male plants be kept away from female plants. (If you thought you could avoid discussion of gender segregation in a fact-check about hemp farming, and not North Carolina’s new bathroom law, we’re sorry to disappoint.) Pollination creates seeds. The problem is hemp needs seeds to be worthwhile – they can be sold as food or turned into oil – but the opposite is true for marijuana. ""Marijuana growers would not want to plant near a hemp field, since this would result in a harvest that is seedy and lower in THC, and degrade the value of their marijuana crop,"" the Congressional Research Service paper said. So people would need to smoke much more of the altered weed in order to get high – if they could still get high off it at all – and the smoking experience would also become much less pleasant. That’s because of all the extra seeds, which pop when ignited, said Janna Beckerman, a professor of botany and plant pathology at Purdue University. Legally, hemp can’t contain more than 0.3 percent THC. According to the Purdue Hemp Project that Beckerman is a researcher for, that’s about 60 times weaker than the legal marijuana being sold in Colorado. And while hemp-pollinated marijuana likely wouldn’t see its THC content drop all the way to hemp’s virtually nonexistant levels, like Yarborough said, Beckerman said it would be drastically reduced. Oregon State University crop and soil science professor emeritus Russell Karow said growing marijuana in a hemp field would lower the value of the hemp, too, providing further incentives against using the legal crop to hide marijuana. The Congressional Research Service came to the same conclusion. ""The two crops are the same species and will indeed cross-pollinate,"" Karow said. ""This results in seed that will not be useful for either purpose – hemp or marijuana."" Our ruling Yarborough said that if you try to hide a marijuana growing operation in a hemp field, ""it becomes worthless. The THC goes away."" Cross-pollination of hemp and marijuana will cause marijuana's buds to lose much of their high-inducing THC, but the THC won’t go away entirely. Researchers agree that while the drug won’t become completely impotent, it will lose much or all of its worth and would also likely damage the value of the hemp crop",Mostly True,"June 14, 2016"
"""You can import as many hemp products into this country as you want...but we can’t grow it.""","At a senate judiciary hearing on Smith Hill May 10, William Devereaux, a lawyer, spoke on behalf of the Narragansett Indian Tribe. Bill S2763, called the ""Hemp Growth Act,"" was up for debate. It would make it legal for residents to grow their own hemp plants if they have a permit and don’t have a criminal record. The tribe has historically used hemp, a cousin of marijuana, for many products, like blankets, ropes, and baskets, Devereaux said. ""You can import as many hemp products into this country as you want . but we can’t grow it,"" Devereaux said.  We thought this was an interesting point. We talked to Devereaux, and he elaborated. ""I can go to the Whole Foods right now and buy a box of cereal with hemp,"" he said. ""But if I grow it, that’s another story. It’s kind of ridiculous."" Indeed, it does seem kind of ridiculous. We wanted to see if he was right. The history of hemp Currently, hemp is packaged with marijuana in the Controlled Substances Act, Attorney General Peter F. Kilmartin wrote in a letter he submitted against Senate Bill 2763. ""Hemp is considered marijuana,"" he wrote. This interpretation came from a few court cases: New Hampshire Hemp Council, Inc. v. Marshall in 2000; U.S. v. White Plume in 2006; and Monson v. Drug Enforcement Agency in 2009. And therefore, ""possession, distribution, manufacture, cultivation, sale, transfer, or the attempt or conspiracy to possess, distribute, manufacture, cultivate, sell or transfer"" hemp is banned. But, this wasn’t always the case. In the 17th century, domestic growth of the plant was encouraged for production of rope, sails and clothes. The Declaration of Independence was signed on hemp paper. Historians even say the first American flags were made out of hemp, grown by none other than George Washington and Andrew Jackson. During World War II the U.S. Department of Agriculture released a ""Hemp for Victory"" propaganda film, offering to give hemp seeds to farmers, and allowing draft deferment to those who would stay behind and grow the plant for military materials (parachutes, ropes, and other things of that nature), according to a PBS Frontline timeline.    In 2014, President Barack Obama signed the Agricultural Act of 2014. Section 7606 of that bill allowed for universities and others to grow or cultivate industrial hemp as long as it's for research purposes, or it’s allowed under state laws. The farmer also must be licensed. Can hemp get you high?  In short, no. The hemp and marijuana plants both come from the Cannabis sativa plant. But, marijuana has much more tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, which is the psychoactive substance that makes you feel high and want to eat an entire pizza. Hemp has a THC level of about 0.3 percent, on average, while marijuana can have up to a 25-percent THC level, according to a 2015 study. As Devereaux put it, ""For you and I to get high on hemp we’d have to put six bales in a fireplace, light it up with lighter fluid and put a blanket over our heads."" Importing hemp Now to the second part of Devereaux’s claim. Can U.S. citizens ""import as many hemp products"" as they want? U.S. Customs and Border Protection  says that hemp products, like paper, rope, clothing, soaps, shampoos, and animal feed, can be imported into the United States. Hemp seeds, as long as they are sterilized, can also be brought into the country. And about that cereal at Whole Foods? A box of Nature’s Path ""Hemp Plus Granola"" will cost you about $5. Our ruling:  Devereaux says ""you can import as many hemp products into this country as you want . but we can’t grow it."" He is correct. The Controlled Substances  Act prohibits the growing and selling of hemp, except under very specific circumstances outlined in Obama’s Agricultural Act. U.S. Customs and Border Protection allows for the import of hemp products and seeds, permitted they are ""sterilized",True,"May 22, 2016"
"""Amendment 2 will put almost 2,000 pot shops in Florida ... more pot shops than Walmart and Walgreens combined.""","Opponents of Florida’s medical marijuana amendment have fired up a new round of attacks, claiming there will be a dispensary on practically every corner if voters approve the initiative. In a three-minute ad released May 16, 2016, the group Vote No On 2 calls Amendment 2 ""a scam to legalize pot."" Should the measure pass, they say, it’s likely that places to buy medical marijuana will outnumber two well-known retail outlets. ""Looks like Amendment 2 will put almost 2,000 pot shops in Florida ... more pot shops than Walmart and Walgreens combined,"" the video says. It goes on to deride California medical marijuana regulations and users, and implies Florida would become like the Golden State if the measure passes. While polls say medical marijuana is enjoying about 80 percent support among voters, Vote No On 2’s figures spark an interesting point. Would the number of medical marijuana dispensaries outnumber Walmarts and Walgreens locations in Florida? That's possible, according to one state estimate, but the figures are a little hazy. Dispensary data Amendment 2 was first on the ballot in 2014 but narrowly lost the 60 percent required to pass. The current version for the November 2016 ballot has the same name, but United for Care, the group behind the measure, altered the language to address some concerns that hounded the 2014 amendment. The amendment now requires parental consent and doctor certification for minors and more clearly defines the medical conditions it covers: cancer, HIV/AIDS, epilepsy, glaucoma, post-traumatic stress disorder, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis ""or other debilitating medical conditions of the same kind or class as or comparable to those enumerated,"" with a doctor’s recommendation. It works like this: If a patient with one of these conditions gets the okay from a doctor, they (or a certified caregiver) will get a state-issued ID card and be able to go to a state-regulated dispensary to buy their marijuana. Doctors technically can’t prescribe marijuana because it is still a Schedule I drug under federal law, meaning it’s considered highly addictive and has no known medical benefits, and is therefore illegal. Doctors would risk losing their ability to practice medicine. Pharmacies also can’t legally distribute cannabis, making dispensaries necessary. So how many dispensaries would there be? The proposed amendment leaves the details of medical marijuana regulations up to the Legislature and the Florida Health Department. Legislators would need to pass a bill for medical marijuana and the health department would develop and enforce regulations. In essence, there could be as few or as many dispensaries as the state wants.   There’s only one estimate for how many patients and dispensaries there would be — a 2015 health department analysis. That report used Florida Department of Economic and Demographic Research data to estimate 440,552 patients in Florida would qualify for medical cannabis. The amendment would lead to 1,993 registered treatment centers, the health department said. That’s the figure Vote No On 2 is using in its ad. United for Care doesn’t dispute the figures, because the health department’s analysis is the only study that’s been done. ""It’s the best educated guess that we have,"" United for Care director Ben Pollara said. ""It’s up to the Department of Health and the Legislature. … It could be 2,000, it could be 20. It could be 5,000."" In any event, 1,993 dispensaries would outnumber all the Walmarts and Walgreens in Florida. Vote No On 2 spokeswoman Christina Johnson said the group chose those businesses to illustrate how ubiquitous dispensaries would be should the amendment pass. The video correctly shows 840 Walgreens drug stores in the state, but includes 191 Walmarts, a figure apparently derived from a January 2007 list from Reclaim Democracy, a group seeking limits on corporate influence in government. A more recent list from Walmart shows 223 supercenters and 10 discount stores. (Neighborhood Markets and Sam’s Club stores are not included in either count.) While Walmart and Walgreens do have pharmacies, we’re not convinced pitting small medical cannabis dispensaries against big chain retailers is a fair comparison. It may be better to compare so-called ""pot shops"" to the overall number of pharmacies. The state health department told us there are 9,725 licensed pharmacies in Florida. To provide more context for the dispensary estimate, we will note that the state Department of Business and Professional Regulation says Florida has 2,082 active licensed veterinary clinics — and 1,893 package liquor stores. Mile-high estimate With so little spelled out in the proposed amendment, we wondered how the health department arrived at its estimate of 1,993 dispensaries. The health department told us they used Colorado, with about 5.3 million people, for the analysis because the state has allowed medical cannabis for years and has a broad baseline of data. The report says there are 515 licensed medical marijuana centers as of October 2015 (there are 528 now, according to the Colorado Department of Revenue) serving almost 114,000 patients. Analysts then scaled that up to Florida’s population of 20 million. Karen O’Keefe, director of state policies and the pro-legislation Marijuana Policy Project, said of the 24 states and the District of Columbia allowing medical marijuana, it’s misleading to use either Colorado or California as examples for Florida. Not only did Colorado decriminalize recreational marijuana use in 2012 — its 421 retail shops are counted separately from medical dispensaries — but both states lacked the kind of initial regulatory oversight Amendment 2 would require. ""California dispensaries still have no state licensing or regulation to speak of, though a regulatory and licensing law should be phased in by 2018,"" O’Keefe said in an email. ""In Colorado, regulations went into effect in 2010-11, but hundreds of dispensaries pre-dated them."" A better state to look to would be New Mexico, O’Keefe said, because it required a licensing program in its law when it passed. New Mexico had 23 dispensaries for its 2 million residents, and expanded that to 35 in 2015. Extrapolating Florida’s total based on New Mexico’s regulations would net far fewer dispensaries, O’Keefe said. If it were based on total land area, Florida could limit the number to about 16. If there were the same number of dispensaries per capita as New Mexico, there could be about 340. ""I really can’t say how many are likely, since it will depend on many factors, with the primary one being regulations. But I would bet it’s far less than 2,000,"" O’Keefe said. Our ruling Vote No On 2 said, ""Amendment 2 will put almost 2,000 pot shops in Florida ... more pot shops than Walmart and Walgreens combined."" The state health department did project 1,993 medical marijuana dispensaries would be needed to serve potential patients, based on data from Colorado compared with Florida. That is more than the 840 Walgreens and 233 Walmart supercenters and discount stores in the state, although the comparison seems like a bit of a red herring. It’s important to remember that while the health department report is the only real estimate available, this figure isn’t definite. The agency and the Legislature would decide the actual number of stores and how they are regulated after the amendment passes. That total is anyone’s guess. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details",Half True,"May 19, 2016"
"Marijuana is a Schedule I drug, ""which you understand means that you can’t do any research about it.""","Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton doesn’t have a firm stance on marijuana legalization yet — she wants to see more research first. But there are some challenges to getting that research, she said. At an ABC town hall April 21, Clinton told audience member Evan Nison, a National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws board member, what she would do as president to address the marijuana legalization debate. ""I've said I want to move marijuana off of Schedule I, which you understand means that you can't do any research about it,"" she said. ""You can't do anything, and I think that's wrong. We have enough anecdotal evidence, as you well know being a member of the NORML Board, about what marijuana can do for medical conditions, easing pain. And we need to be doing research on it because I am 100 percent in favor of medical uses for marijuana. But I want to know what the evidence is."" The 1970 Controlled Substances Act classified marijuana as a Schedule I drug, a category that includes drugs with a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. This puts marijuana in the same class as heroin and ecstasy and a notch higher than meth and cocaine. We wondered if Clinton was correct that marijuana’s Schedule I classification means scientists can’t research it. (Hat-tip to our buds at FactCheck.org who looked at her claim first.) We talked to some scientists who do, in fact, research marijuana. The regulatory hoops make their work challenging but not impossible. Stuck in the weeds The government doesn’t ban scientific research on Schedule I drugs like marijuana. In 2015, the National Institutes of Health put approximately $111 million into 281 research projects studying cannabinoids, which are chemical compounds found in marijuana. (Not all of these studies actually involve giving marijuana to human subjects.) But the government has tried to make it harder to study marijuana and other drugs it has historically considered dangerous and without medical use, for fear that the drugs could be stolen or fall into the wrong hands, said John Hudak, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and an expert in federal marijuana policy. ""Marijuana has always been treated most unique among scheduled drugs in ways that made it even harder to study,"" especially in terms of acquiring plants for the research, Hudak told PolitiFact. As a result, in many states where medical marijuana is legal, doctors and policymakers have to base their practices on limited science, Hudak and co-author Grace Wallack wrote in a Brookings report. He cited research that found Schedule I designations discourage scientists from trying to study these drugs. To conduct marijuana research, researchers have to submit an investigational new drug application to the Food and Drug Administration, and the Drug Enforcement Administration has to license the research site and the investigating scientist. If a scientist wanted to conduct three studies on a non-Schedule I drug in three different labs, he or she could get an umbrella approval for this project. But to conduct a similar set of studies on a Schedule I drug such as marijuana, the researcher would have to get approval for each individual site and investigator, said Igor Grant, director of the Center for Medical Cannabis Research at the University of California, San Diego. Until about a year ago, a Public Health Service committee also had to review privately funded projects, in a process almost identical to the FDA review. But President Barack Obama’s administration did away with that requirement. Grant, whose lab has completed seven studies on medical uses for cannabis, said that before this revision, it could take between six and 18 months to get all the necessary government approvals to start a study. Now, it takes a little less time. The supply of federally approved marijuana plants is another major barrier. If researchers want to use the marijuana plant, there is only one source: the University of Mississippi, which contracts with the National Institute of Drug Abuse to grow marijuana for research purposes. So researchers can only get however much marijuana the facility is able to produce, and they’re subject to the facility’s timeline. The program has good intentions in providing drugs that might otherwise be difficult to work with, and they can control the chemical makeup of the plant, said Christine Rabinak, a pharmacy and neuroscience professor at Wayne State University. But there are some concerns about how well the government’s supply matches the kind of marijuana that is currently commercially available for medicinal purposes. ""I think we are going to be limited on what research can be conducted in the United States with other strains of cannabis because of these federal barriers,"" she said. Some researchers, including Rabinak, use synthetic versions of chemical compounds found in marijuana, which she said are much easier to acquire than the plant itself. Grant said that if the government were to reschedule marijuana to a lower classification, there would likely be more marijuana research because the project review process would be so much easier. It would especially open up opportunities for scientists who might not have the time or resources to spend months waiting for federal approval under the current rules. Hudak’s Brookings paper concluded that rescheduling marijuana would remove one hurdle for researchers, while also recommending lifting the federal government’s control over growing marijuana plants for research and reforming licensing requirements, among other policy changes. While Clinton’ statement is incorrect, there’s some truth to her larger point that current policy makes it hard to research marijuana, Grant said. ""It does not mean the studies cannot be done or that the federal government is consciously trying to block the studies,"" he said. ""It’s just a complicated process."" Our ruling Clinton said marijuana is a Schedule I drug, ""which you understand means that you can’t do any research about it."" It’s hard to research marijuana, especially using plants (as opposed to synthetic versions) in studies involving human subjects. There are many regulatory hoops scientists have to navigate, and the government has a single-source monopoly on marijuana plants to be used for research. All of this makes setting up a marijuana experiment a lengthy and daunting process. However, there are scientists currently studying marijuana, and federal funding supports some of these experiments. Clinton’s statement gives the impression that the government bans marijuana research flat-out, and that’s not the case",Mostly False,"April 26, 2016"
"""Most Americans are ready to put it [marijuana prohibition] behind us and move on.""","Gallup pollsters took the nation’s pulse on marijuana legalization in October and the findings led supporters of legal pot use to declare victory. ""It’s pretty clear which direction our nation is heading on this issue,"" Mason Tvert, a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project, said in a news release. ""The status quo has shifted. Marijuana prohibition has been a public policy disaster, and most Americans are ready to put it behind us and move on."" We started our fact checking with Gallup’s recent report to see if it really does show that a majority of Americans support legalization. Just the title of the report — ""In U.S., 58 percent back legal marijuana use"" — gave us a pretty clear sign that it does. ""Americans’ support for legalizing marijuana is the highest Gallup has measured to date, at 58 percent,"" the report concludes. ""Younger generations of Americans,"" Gallup says, ""have been increasingly likely to favor legal use of marijuana as they entered adulthood compared with older generations of Americans when they were the same age decades ago. Now more than seven in 10 of today’s young adults support legalization."" The 58 percent figure represents the percentage of 1,015 people who answered ""Yes,"" when they were asked, ""Do you think the use of marijuana should be made legal or not?"" The percent of Americans who support legalization first hit 58 percent in 2013, dipped to 51 percent in 2014 and rebounded back to 58 percent in 2015, according to Gallup. ""Over the past six years, support has vacillated a bit, but averaged 48 percent from 2010 through 2012 and has averaged above majority level, 56 percent, since 2013,"" says the report. The poll was conducted Oct. 7 to Oct. 11, just before leading Democrats faced off in a presidential nomination debate televised by CNN on Oct. 13. During that exchange, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders expressed their views on marijuana legalization. Clinton laughed, at the debate, when she was reminded that about a year ago she had told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that she didn’t smoke marijuana when she was young and has no intention of starting now. Clinton said ""No"" when she was asked if she is ready ""to take a position"" on legalization. But she said she’s interested in learning more about legalization from states that have approved recreational marijuana use. For his part, Sanders said he would vote for a local Nevada measure that would legalize recreational pot use. He has proposed removing marijuana from the federal government’s list of most dangerous outlawed drugs, according to the Washington Post. The same Gallup report says Democrats and independents are the ""most likely"" of ""political groups"" to favor legalization while Republicans and older Americans are least likely to support it. Late last week, Republican Donald Trump, speaking at a rally, said states should be allowed to legalize marijuana if they choose to do so, according to the Post. This was a softer stance on the subject for Trump, who says he doesn’t drink or smoke tobacco. Two of the other leading Republican candidates are holding the line. Republican, Marco Rubio would enforce federal law against states that have legalized marijuana use. And Republican Ben Carson, who is leading in the polls, is a retired neurosurgeon who staunchly opposes legalization. Many studies, he says, show marijuana has a harmful effect on a brain as it develops, which continues into a person’s late twenties. ""So why would we even think about it?"" he asked. ""This should be completely off the table."" Our ruling Gallup’s survey has found that a ""majority"" of Americans support marijuana legalization. It’s been a trend that a few of the candidates for president have reflected in their campaigns. Tvert got it right",True,"November 8, 2015"
"""We are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana.""","Marijuana came up a number of times during the first Democratic debate on Oct. 14, 2015 -- in some cases when candidates were asked whether they had used the stuff, and at other times in the context of criminal justice policy. A reader asked us to check one claim by Sen. Bernie Sanders related to marijuana. Late in the debate, Sanders was asked whether he had a position on a proposal to legalize recreational marijuana in Nevada, the state where the debate was being held. If he were a Nevada resident, Sanders said, ""I suspect I would vote yes. And I would vote yes because I am seeing in this country too many lives being destroyed for nonviolent offenses. We have a criminal justice system that lets CEOs on Wall Street walk away, and yet we are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana. I think we have to think through this war on drugs."" A moment later, Sanders’ rival for the nomination, Hillary Clinton, provided rhetorical support for Sanders’ claim, saying, ""I agree completely with the idea that we have got to stop imprisoning people who use marijuana."" But is it true that, as Sanders put it, the United States is ""imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana""? We decided to take a closer look. Prisoner data What the figures show is that possession itself isn’t usually enough to land someone in jail. Rather, those sentenced to prison for marijuana offenses were typically found to be committing crimes more serious than just possessing marijuana (or ""smoking"" it, as Sanders put it). Often, this means selling it or trafficking it. The Justice Department estimated that 3.6 percent of state inmates in 2013 had drug possession as their most serious offense. That includes possession charges for all drugs, not just marijuana. To gauge the marijuana-only percentage, we have to go back to data that’s about a decade old. The Justice Department periodically carries out surveys of inmates in state and federal correctional facilities, the last of which was from 2004. According to this study, only about three-tenths of 1 percent of state prison inmates were there because of marijuana possession alone, without a more serious charge. Meanwhile, the statistics for federal inmates paint a similar picture. The data shows that among the roughly 67,600 offenders sentenced to prison in federal criminal cases between Oct. 1, 2011 and Sept. 30, 2012, only 28 of them were incarcerated on drug-possession charges alone -- roughly four one-hundredths of 1 percent of all incarcerations. And that includes all drugs, not just marijuana. Looked at another way, the same report found that 99.9 percent of those sentenced to federal prison for any drug-related crime during that year-long period were sent to prison for something more serious than simple possession. Drug policy experts we contacted agree that imprisonment for marijuana possession by itself is rare. ""He’s wrong,"" said Jonathan P. Caulkins, a public policy professor and drug-policy specialist at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. ""Basically no one goes to prison just because they use marijuana. The vast majority of time, the people who are in jail for marijuana possession also have other things that are part of their record."" Nancy G. La Vigne, director of the Justice Policy Center at the Urban Institute, agreed. ""Very, very few people are incarcerated for low quantities of marijuana possession,"" she said. And Allen St. Pierre -- executive director of the pro-marijuana-legalization group NORML -- concurs, calling Sanders’ claim ""a tad off."" NORML and other groups have estimated that there are 50,000 to 110,000 cannabis-only offenders are in prison in the United States -- yet ""most, but not all, of those incarcerated on marijuana charges are there for cultivation, sales or trafficking,"" he said. Some caveats All this said, we should note a few points. Experts say different jurisdictions may have divergent standards and thresholds in charging defendants for marijuana possession. Some states even consider passing around a joint at a party to be considered ""distributing,"" said Douglas Berman, an Ohio State University law professor. In addition, the statistics we cited above do not include people sent temporarily to jail -- potentially a much larger population than those serving sentences prison. The jail population could include people who have violated probation for testing positive for marijuana, or for failing to pay a fine for marijuana possession, said Bill Piper, the director of national affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance. Marijuana arrests As it happens, Sanders might have been on safer ground had he stuck to citing arrests for marijuana possession rather than prison time. St. Pierre said that the most recent FBI data shows that of the roughly 700,000 arrests for marijuana-related charges in 2014, about 90 percent were for possession only -- and these arrests can have radiating consequences. Even spending a night or two in jail for marijuana possession can cause ""tremendous disruption to their lives -- they can lose their jobs when they don’t show up for work the next day, or they can miss critical doctor appointments, or they can’t pick up their kids from school,"" Piper said. ""This is regardless of whatever penalty they get, and even if the charges are ultimately dropped."" La Vigne added that the high arrest rates for marijuana possession has other negative consequences, such as racial disparities in exposure to the criminal justice system. Indeed, when we checked with Sanders’ staff, spokesman Warren Gunnels cited a news report of the FBI arrest statistics. As for prison time, he said that even if the numbers of people in prison for marijuana possession are relatively small, it’s still more than ""the number of senior executives on Wall Street who went to jail for the near collapse of the economy in 2008"" -- which is the comparison Sanders made during the debate. Our ruling Sanders said, ""We are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana."" Being sentenced to prison for marijuana possession by itself can happen -- but it’s exceedingly rare. Sanders would have been on safer ground had he kept to pointing out continuing high levels of arrests for marijuana possession. These can result in a night in jail and a cascade of problems for those who are arrested, but getting a prison sentence for just smoking a joint is extremely unusual",Mostly False,"October 14, 2015"
"If Milwaukee approves reducing its maximum forfeiture for marijuana possession to $50, the city would have ""23 different bicycle violations that have a higher forfeiture.""","On June 2, 2015, the Milwaukee Common Council is scheduled to decide whether to reduce the maximum city portion of the fine for possession of a sandwich-size bag of marijuana. That portion of the total fine -- known formally as a forfeiture -- would be a maximum of $50, down from the current limit of $500. When the council debated the proposed ordinance change on May 12, 2015, it was opposed by Ald. Robert Puente, who served for 27 years on the Milwaukee police force. ""We have 23 different bicycle violations that have a higher forfeiture than this,"" said Puente, before adding: ""I just think this is really disproportionate."" Is that right? If the council approves reducing the maximum forfeiture for marijuana possession, would it be lower than the forfeiture for 23 bicycle violations? Marijuana When you get a ticket, think of the amount shown on the ticket as the fine. The total fine is composed of various parts. Those parts include the forfeiture, the part cited by Puente, which is paid to the city’s general fund. Added to that are various city, county and state fees and surcharges. In Milwaukee, the Common Council sets not only the range of forfeiture amounts for a given violation, but also a standard forfeiture amount that should be imposed in most cases. Those standard forfeiture amounts are reviewed regularly and can be adjusted within the range. Let’s start with marijuana as an example. The city ordinance applies to possession of 25 grams or less of marijuana. Twenty-five grams is slightly less than 1 ounce (0.88), or roughly a sandwich bag full of marijuana. Currently, the minimum forfeiture for marijuana possession is $250 and the maximum is $500. The standard forfeiture amount is $265.87. In other words, the forfeiture amount of the fine you’re given for marijuana possession typically would be $265.87. But the judge in your case could reduce the forfeiture portion to $250 -- or, in rare circumstances, increase the forfeiture. Ald. Nik Kovac has led the effort to reduce the marijuana possession forfeitures. He has said African-Americans in Milwaukee are cited for marijuana possession much more often than other people. And he has argued that the disproportionate jailing of black men is due in part to those who are ticketed for marijuana possession and end up in jail because they can’t pay the forfeiture and fees. Kovac’s initial proposal, in September 2014, was to reduce the forfeiture range dramatically. The minimum would have been $1 and the maximum $5. But his proposed range was later amended to zero to $50 -- which is what the council is being asked to approve. The Milwaukee Municipal Court, in a May 26, 2015 memo signed by the three municipal judges, opposes lowering the $500 maximum. But it suggests reducing the minimum from $250 to zero. That way, the judges would have more flexibility, being able to impose forfeitures anywhere from zero to $500. The memo also made two other points: 1. Since 2012, municipal judges have issued only 12 orders for incarceration for marijuana possession and only eight of those individuals actually served time in jail. 2. Setting a maximum forfeiture for marijuana possession that is lower than that for many other violations ""that are arguably less serious"" would ""send the wrong message to our community."" Bicycles As for the 23 bicycle violations cited by Puente, they include abandonment of a bicycle, failure to comply with a traffic signal and brakes not in good working condition. Nine of the violations carry a maximum forfeiture of $500 -- much higher than the $50 maximum for marijuana, should the marijuana ordinance be changed. But as a practical matter, the standard forfeiture for all 23 bike violations is only $20. Our rating Puente said if Milwaukee approves reducing its maximum forfeiture for marijuana possession to $50, the city would have ""23 different bicycle violations that have a higher forfeiture."" In practice, the actual forfeiture that is imposed for the 23 bicycle violations is only $20. However, the maximum forfeiture for nine of those violations is $500",Half True,"June 1, 2015"
"""The proportion of Rhode Islanders entering substance abuse treatment primarily due to marijuana use has reached its highest point in 20 years.""","When the House Judiciary Committee was considering legislation to tax and regulate marijuana, Kathleen Sullivan, Warren’s substance abuse coordinator, stepped forward to warn the committee about the dangers of marijuana use. ""We do know that the proportion of Rhode Islanders entering substance abuse treatment primarily due to marijuana use has reached its highest point in 20 years,"" she told the committee during the April 29 hearing. When we contacted her for details, she emailed statistics collected from the states by the U.S. Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration. Her data on admissions for substance abuse treatment, primarily for marijuana, ranged from 1993 through 2011, a year shy of the 20 years she spoke of. According to those statistics, the rate of admissions in 1993 was 96 per 100,000 Rhode Islanders age 12 and older. In 2011, the rate was 166 admissions. But this wasn’t the highest that the rate has ever been over the past two decades. It peaked at 218 in 2009 and then declined in the next two years. The number of admissions, unadjusted for population, peaked that year as well, and then dropped. When we looked at the number of admissions that the federal agency reported online for 2012 and 2013, we found that the decline has continued, showing a drop each year since 2009. In her email, Sullivan qualified her statement saying: ""I was referring to the overall trend in marijuana admissions."" So we took another look at the data and examined the trend in admission rates, even though she didn’t make this distinction in her testimony. The trend from beginning to end for admissions per 100,000 teens and adults has been up over the past two decades. But if you look at the trend line since 1999, there has been no statistically significant increase.   We also contacted the U.S. Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration directly and officials there told us there are limitations to the data that make Sullivan's position problematic. One major problem is that an individual can be counted more than once each year depending on how many times he or she has been admitted for treatment, explained Kelley Smith, a statistician with the administration's Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality. Smith said the data, known as the Treatment Episode Data Set or TEDS, do not support the assertion that the number of Rhode Islanders entering substance abuse treatment has reached its highest point in 20 years. ""Not according to TEDS,"" Smith said in an email. ""According to TEDS, the percentages have remained relatively stable."" Our ruling Kathleen Sullivan said the proportion of Rhode Islanders entering substance abuse treatment, primarily for marijuana, has reached its highest point in 20 years. Her documentation shows a peak in 2009, but then admissions decline through 2011. More recent data show the decline has continued. Further, our trend analysis shows no increase since 1999. And a federal statistician at the agency that compiled the data said admission rates have been ""relatively stable"" over the past 20 years",False,"May 17, 2015"
"""We've seen the increase of alcohol use for underage kids even though alcohol has been illegal ... for kids under 21.""","Supporters of legalizing recreational marijuana last week unrolled the latest bill  to decriminalize possession of small amounts of cannabis, saying it could mean up to $58 million in tax revenue and give the state an economic boost. But those on the other side of the debate caution that legalization would lead to greater consumption of the drug and other social problems. Rhode Islanders may end up driving impaired and endangering others, for example.  Minors would find it even easier to obtain the drug, even if it would remain illegal for people under age 21 under the proposed law, they said. One such opponent is Nancy DeNuccio, chairwoman of the Ocean State Prevention Alliance, a coalition that aims to limit the impact of marijuana on youth. In a   WJAR-10 news report about the latest legalization legislation, DeNuccio expressed her concern about the potential consequences to young people of legalizing marijuana for adults. ""We've seen the increase of alcohol use for under age kids even though alcohol has been illegal ... for kids under 21,"" she said. After a reader asked us to check her statement, we called DeNuccio, who immediately told us that she’d misspoken, that it was a mistake. Still, we decided that we’d look into her claim because whatever we found might help inform our readers as lawmakers take up the debate. Also, the statement was made in a television interview that remains publicly available. We found our answer in data from the Centers for Disease Control’s national Youth Risk Behavior Survey. It shows that, in Rhode Island, the percentage of teens who reported drinking alcohol at least once in the past 30 days had fallen dramatically since 1997 -- from 52 percent in 1997 to 31 percent in 2013. Similarly, the number of state high schoolers who said they consumed alcohol beyond a sip or two before age 13 had dropped over the same period, from 34 percent to 14 percent. The same goes for the percentage of teenagers who said they had five or more drinks in a row at least once in the past 30 days. Those numbers decreased from 32 percent in 1997 to 15 percent in 2013. As for the percentage of Rhode Island high schoolers who reported consuming at least one alcoholic beverage in their lifetime, those numbers dropped from a high of 79 percent in 2001 to a low of 62 percent in 2011. The Rhode Island numbers mirror what has been reported around the country. Nationally, the percentages of teenagers reporting drinking declined in three of the same four criteria. The only category to remain static was the percentage of high schoolers who said they drank five or more drinks in one sitting at least once in the past 30 days. Those numbers showed gains and losses throughout the time period, keeping it steady, according to the survey. Our ruling Nancy DeNuccio said, ""We've seen the increase of alcohol use for underage kids even though alcohol has been illegal ... for kids under 21.""

"Says Debbie Wasserman Schultz ""voted repeatedly to send terminally ill patients to prison.""","As U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., weighs a potential presidential bid in 2016, a long list of politicians are considering whether to run for his Senate seat. That includes U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Weston, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, according to a Politico report on Feb. 17. (She’s not a lock on the Democratic side. A Tampa Bay Times Florida Insider Poll suggests U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy of Palm Beach County and newly elected U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham of Leon County could also be strong contenders.) One group was quick to attack Wasserman Schultz’s potential candidacy: The pro-pot lobby. Last year, she opposed Florida’s medical marijuana ballot initiative, which received almost 58 percent support, two points shy of passage. She also voted against a congressional amendment supported by advocates for medical marijuana. ""She’s voted repeatedly to send terminally ill patients to prison. And we’re certainly going to make sure Floridians know that — not to mince words,"" Bill Piper, national affairs director with the Drug Policy Alliance, told Politico. Did Wasserman Schultz repeatedly take votes to send dying patients to prison? Politico reported in a follow-up article that Wasserman Schultz offered to change her opposition if Orlando lawyer John Morgan, the force behind the Florida ballot initiative, stopped bashing her, which she denied in an interview with the Sun Sentinel. Morgan hopes to get a revised version on the ballot in 2016. Wasserman Schultz’s marijuana voting record The Drug Policy Alliance pointed to several of Wasserman Schultz’s votes, including on a congressional amendment that banned the use of federal money to interfere with state medical marijuana laws. The goal of the amendment, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., was to prevent federal agents from raiding retail operations in states where medical pot is legal. (We looked at a similar claim by another pro-pot group about her vote in 2014.) Wasserman Schultz, one of 17 Democrats in the House to vote against the amendment on May 30, 2014, said she didn’t want to ""limit the executive branch’s ability to enforce current federal law at their discretion."" The language was attached to another bill and signed into law in December. (She voted against similar failed amendments four times between 2005 and 2012.) Her vote on those amendments ""was very much focused on patients, and the fear of arrest they and their caregivers live under,"" Piper told PolitiFact Florida. He also argued that the Florida ballot measure -- which Wasserman Schultz opposed -- would have protected patients using medical marijuana.   Last year, she said the Florida ballot initiative was ""written too broadly and stops short of ensuring strong regulatory oversight from state officials."" Piper also pointed to Wasserman Schultz’s ""no"" vote on an April 2014 congressional amendment on a spending bill for Veterans Affairs. The amendment, which failed, would have allowed VA doctors to talk to their patients about medical marijuana in states in which it is legal. But it’s a stretch to say that her ""no"" vote means she wants dying patients to go to prison. Wasserman Schultz spokesman Sean Bartlett told the Washington Post at the time that she felt it was premature to vote on the amendment. She wanted to wait for the results of a study approved by the federal government to look at marijuana’s potential effects on post-traumatic stress disorder. Do feds put terminally ill patients in prison? Do these votes mean she repeatedly voted to send terminally ill patients to prison? That’s a stretch. Even before her 2014 congressional votes, there were reasons that users were not a priority for the feds. In 2013, U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued a memorandum to federal attorneys telling them to focus on cartels or other criminal organizations. Beyond that, the Justice Department said it was content to allow state and local agencies ""to address marijuana activity through enforcement of their own narcotics laws."" The pro-pot lobby has pointed to cases of growers prosecuted for serving ill patients, including transplant recipient Jerry Duval, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Duval was a state-registered caregiver but prosecutors argued he peddled pot to non-patients. One high-profile case remains pending -- initially dubbed Kettle Falls 5, named for defendants in eastern Washington. Prosecutors say the five defendants were conspiring to manufacture and distribute marijuana, and they were also charged with possessing firearms. One defendant, Larry Harvey, told USA Today that the pot he grew was for personal medical use. On Feb. 18, the Justice Department dropped the charges against Harvey, 71, who was recently diagnosed with stage-four pancreatic cancer. However, the charges remain for his wife, two other relatives and a family friend. Law professors we interviewed told us that the federal government hasn’t focused on individuals who simply use marijuana for their own medical needs, and that was true even before the congressional amendment passed. ""The feds don't send people to prison for using marijuana,"" Vanderbilt law Professor Robert Mikos told PolitiFact Florida. ""They do deny some benefits to users (like access to some VA services). And the law authorizes prison for users. But the law is not enforced so rigidly."" George Mason University law professor Ilya Somin, an adjunct scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that the amendment passed last year ""may well constrain federal prosecution of medical marijuana suppliers in states where their activities are legal."" However, he added, the fact that the Kettle Falls case is still going forward shows such prosecutions still can happen. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz ""voted repeatedly to send terminally ill patients to prison,"" Piper said. She voted against amendments to ban the federal government from interfering with state medical marijuana laws. In theory, advocates believe that the amendment -- which passed late in 2014 after multiple attempts -- prevents the feds from going after sick marijuana users in states that allow medical marijuana. However, even before the amendment passed, dying patients who simply smoked joints that they obtained legally were not being hauled off to prison en masse by federal agents. Instead, the federal government focused on major suppliers or distributors. Saying Wasserman Schultz voted to send people to prison significantly exaggerates the issue. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression",Mostly False,"February 26, 2015"
"""The 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that up to half of daily marijuana smokers become addicted -- an estimated 2.7 million people in the U.S.""","Vigorous debate surrounds efforts to legalize marijuana around the nation and in Rhode Island, where advocates are pushing legalization proposals in the General Assembly. (In 2013, the state decriminalized possession of small amounts of non-medical  marijuana.) Author Susan Shapiro, who says she is ambivalent about legalizing marijuana, shared her story about what she called her ""extreme addiction"" to marijuana in a commentary published Jan. 10, 2015, in The Providence Journal entitled ""Susan Shapiro: My pot addiction nearly ruined my life."" She told of marijuana’s ""dark side,"" and included statistics to reinforce her point. ""The 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that up to half of daily marijuana smokers become addicted -- an estimated 2.7 million people in the U.S,"" she wrote. We wondered if the figure Shapiro used is true. We called her to find out how she backed up her claim. She referred us to a story that ran July 14, 2014, in USA Today entitled ""Marijuana poses more risks than many realize"" by reporter Liz Szabo. She took the information from that piece, she said. The story quoted Nora D. Volkow, director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse, a federal agency that supports research on drug abuse and addiction. The relevant section in the story Shapiro cited reads:  ""Up to half of people who smoke marijuana daily become addicted. According to the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2.7 million people over age 12 meet criteria for addiction to marijuana."" We contacted the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), which produced the survey cited by Shapiro and Volkow. We also reached out to Volkow’s organization, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). The SAMHSA survey found that 5.4 million people said they used marijuana daily or almost daily in 2012. Almost daily was defined as 300 or more days in the past year.  (Another 18.9 million said they had used marijuana at least once in the past month.) NIDA forwarded us a detailed table from the SAMHSA’s 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. It showed that 2.69 million people over age 12 with dependence on marijuana and hashish in the past year. That’s roughly half the number of daily marijuana smokers, as Shapiro said. Tamara Ward, a SAMHSA spokeswoman, told us that dependence on illicit drugs or alcohol is defined as meeting three out of seven criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV, including the need for markedly increased amounts of the substance, withdrawal symptoms, and  reduction or abandonment of social, work or recreational activities because of use. That sounded like addiction to us, but to be sure, we also reached out to Wayne D. Hall, a professor and director of the Centre for Youth Substance Abuse Research at the University of Queensland, in Australia. We asked Hall if dependence amounted to addiction. He said he used the words interchangeably but that not everyone does, especially not in the case of opioid drugs. We also contacted Dr. Stuart  Gitlow, an addiction medicine specialist in Woonsocket and president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine. He agreed. ""Clearly, all those who have dependence also have addiction, but it's not as clear that all those with abuse also have addiction. Some probably do not,"" Gitlow said. Our ruling Susan Shapiro wrote ""The 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that up to half of daily marijuana smokers become addicted -- an estimated 2.7 million people in the U.S."" The survey found that 5.4 million people reported using marijuana daily or almost daily.

"""Colorado raked in $60 million in marijuana taxes and licensing fees in the past year.""","The debate over the legalization of marijuana is a lively one, with strong opinions on either side. In a recent commentary in The Providence Journal, James Aubin, the founder of pro-legalization group Common Sense Citizen, argued for the legalization of  marijuana in Rhode Island, saying it could boost the state’s sagging economy. He included an impressive statistic about the revenue Colorado was bringing in from marijuana sales. ""Colorado raked in $60 million in marijuana taxes and licensing fees in the past year, plus saved most if not all of the $145 million the Harvard report estimated it spent each year fighting marijuana,"" Aubin wrote in the Jan. 5, 2015, piece. (The Harvard report he mentioned was ""The Budgetary Implications of Drug Prohibition,"" a 2010 study by professor Jeffrey Miron. He estimated that Rhode Island spends $40 million annually fighting marijuana.) We decided to focus on the first half of his statement, dealing with Colorado revenue. We asked Aubin where he got his numbers. He responded that he relied on the State of Colorado's Department of Revenue, as well as a story from Channel 7-KMGH, the Denver ABC News affiliate. We pulled Colorado’s tax records ourselves. We added up the monthly figures, from Jan. 1, 2014, when the first recreational marijuana stores opened, through Oct. 31, the most recent report. We determined that the state’s total marijuana tax revenue was about $60 million. The revenue comes from a 2.9-percent retail and medical marijuana sales tax; a 10-percent retail marijuana special sales tax; and a 15-percent marijuana excise tax, plus application and license fees for retail and medical marijuana. In other words, Aubin got his number right. We were curious about where the money went. Colorado tax records show that a portion of the revenue from marijuana retail sales  is distributed to local governments where stores are located, including Denver and the ski resort towns of Breckenridge and Telluride, based on tax revenue brought in from marijuana sales in those communities. Denver, for example, received $128,586. Most of the money goes into the state general fund. But voters dedicated the first $40 million in excise taxes annually to a statewide school construction fund, administered by the state Department of Education. So far, that  tax has generated $10 million for the fund. The monthly revenue from marijuana has increased steadily. In January, the total collected in taxes and fee was $3.5 million; in October, it was $7.6 million. We also looked at news articles about the tax implications of legalizing marijuana. One, by Associated Press writer Kristen Wyatt, reports that estimates for tax potential from marijuana sales vary widely. States with legalized recreational marijuana sales could see their revenue drop as more states move to legalize.   Another story, by Associated Press reporter Gene Johnson, detailed how tax revenues from legal sales of marijuana  were being undercut by regular users buying medical or black-market marijuana to avoid the higher taxes. Officials in Colorado and Washington, two of the four states that have legalized sale of recreational marijuana, are  considering ways to rein in the medical marijuana system and to reduce the tax differential between medical and retail sales. For the record, Rhode Island legalized medical marijuana in 2006. In 2013, it decriminalized possession of small amounts of non-medical marijuana; anyone caught with up to one ounce is subject to a $150 fine instead of facing a misdemeanor criminal charge. Our ruling James Aubin wrote that ""Colorado raked in $60 million in marijuana taxes and licensing fees in the past year …"". Documents we reviewed from the Colorado Department of Revenue showed that total marijuana revenue from taxes and fees was about $60 million between Jan. 1 through Oct. 31, 2014. Of course, this figure tells only part of the story about Colorado’s legalization of marijuana. There are also costs, including administrative expenses and societal costs yet to be determined. But those are beyond the scope of this fact-check",True,"January 11, 2015"
"""Surveys of teens in high school reveal that knowing a classmate who sells cannabis is 90 times more common than knowing a classmate who sells alcohol.""","A retired doctor recently included an eye-catching statistic in a commentary in The Providence Journal urging the legalization of marijuana in Rhode Island. ""Surveys of teens in high school reveal that knowing a classmate who sells cannabis is 90 times more common than knowing a classmate who sells alcohol,"" wrote James P. Crowley, a past president of the Rhode Island Medical Society and professor emeritus of medicine at Brown University, in a piece published Dec. 6, 2014. Crowley cited the statistic to demonstrate that cannabis is the most commonly sold drug in schools. He warned that its prohibition introduces teens to an underground culture of increasingly more dangerous substances. Crowley supports legislation that would regulate, rather than prohibit cannabis. (In 2013, Rhode Island became the 15th state to decriminalize non-medical marijuana possession; anyone caught with up to one ounce is subject to a $150 fine instead of facing a misdemeanor criminal charge.) While we were doubtful about an underground culture of selling alcohol in schools, we wondered whether Crowley was right. We sent him an email asking him for his source. We also reached out to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to see what comparable statistics these federal agencies had. All responded they did not have data to verify the statement. When Crowley got back to us, he attributed the information to Jared Moffat, director of Regulate Rhode Island, a group that supports legalizing marijuana. Moffat, in turn, referred us to a survey of students, ages 12 to 17, published in 2012 by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University. The ""National Survey of American Attitudes on Substance Abuse XVII: Teens,"" found that 44 percent of the 1,003 students surveyed reported they knew a student who sold drugs at their school. Among that 44 percent, 91 percent reported that they knew a student who sold marijuana on school grounds while about 1 percent, said they knew a student who sold alcohol. The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University did not pose the same question to students in previous surveys, and did not publish a 2013 survey. We reached out to Rhode Island KidsCount and to the state Department of Education to see what information they might have for Rhode Island students. KidsCount did not track that particular information. Elliot Krieger, spokesman for the state Department of Education, referred us to the ""SurveyWorks"" student survey of 2013-2014. Among the roughly 32,000 Rhode Island students who offered a response, 10.2 percent said someone had sold or given them an illegal drug on school property in the past year. Similarly, 9.5 percent reported that they had been under the influence of alcohol at school in the same timeframe.   We also asked Robert Houghtaling, director of the East Greenwich Drug Program, for his take on Crowley’s claim that high school pot dealers far outnumbered students selling alcohol. ""Kids usually don’t have to sell alcohol. It’s so easily accessible,"" Houghtaling said.""They steal it from their parents, secure a fake ID, or arrange for someone to buy it for them. ""In terms of using, alcohol is still the predominantly most-used drug,"" he said. ""Alcohol is so prevalent people view it as a rite of passage."" Our ruling James P. Crowley wrote that ""Surveys of teens in high school reveal that knowing a classmate who sells cannabis is 90 times more common than knowing a classmate who sells alcohol."" But he could only cite one survey, and we couldn’t find any others that asked the same question. One data point does not a trend make. In addition, his statement suggests that the findings of this survey reflect the results from all students polled. It doesn’t. It only looked at the subset of students who said they knew of someone who sold drugs in school",Half True,"December 21, 2014"
"When Colorado  eased its medical marijuana laws, fatal accidents involving pot-using drivers soared while overall traffic fatalities decreased.","Cautions abound from opponents and supporters alike in Georgia’s debate about whether to legalize medical marijuana. The most likely measure to pass is a bill that gained traction last year and is being reintroduced this year by state Rep. Allen Peake, R-Macon, to allow cannabis oil for treatment of certain seizure disorders and other health problems. But a second bill to allow vaporized, edible and smokeable marijuana for medical use has prompted new claims about safety problems and other unintended consequences. Chuck Spahos, executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, told a joint legislative committee that no district attorney in the state will prosecute those caught with cannabis oil. But he warned lawmakers about smokeable marijuana, saying that Colorado has seen the number of traffic fatalities go up among drivers who test positive for marijuana, at the same time that state’s overall traffic fatality rate declined. ""Colorado has seen a decrease in traffic fatalities by 14.8 percent between 2007 and 2012,"" Spahos said. ""But it’s up 100 percent for operators who tested positive for marijuana."" ""We don’t want to stand in the way of this oil being available,"" he said. ""This is how bad it’s going to be if we let it go too far."" So did medical marijuana really lead to such a dramatic uptick in stoned drivers? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check it out. First, it’s important to understand Colorado’s history on the issue. Voters there approved medical marijuana in its smokeable form in 2000. But commercialization of the drug did not really begin until 2009, when federal officials announced they would not seek prosecution of those complying with state medical marijuana laws. Voters approved recreational use of the drug last year. So the statistics Spahos referenced covered just before the rapid growth of marijuana dispensaries but before recreational use was permitted. He cited an August 2014 report from the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Traffic Area as his source. The report is unequivocal. The exact figures cited by Spahos are found in the findings under the report’s section for impaired driving. A chart breaks down the actual numbers: Year Statewide Fatalities Operators Testing Positive 2007 554 39 2008 548 43 2009 465 47 2010 450 49 2011 447 63 2012 472 78 Based on this report, Spahos’ claim appears accurate. However, there are several complications with the data. No one from the RMHIDTA responded to requests for comment. The report cites the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration and its own research for its data. But when contacted, a spokesman for the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration referred us back to the Colorado Department of Transportation for the figures, saying each state reports different information. No federal data could confirm the report’s claim. Meanwhile, the statistics from Colorado’s DOT don’t match the RMHIDTA report. The DOT figures are: Year Statewide Fatalities Drivers Testing Positive 2007 554 26 2008 548 31 2009 465 37 2010 450 42 2011 447 52 2012 474 36 The DOT figures confirm an overall decrease in traffic fatalities, but show about a 39 percent increase for drivers who tested positive for marijuana. That’s still an increase, but hardly a 100 percent jump. More importantly, Colorado DOT spokeswoman Amy Ford said the agency is cautious to use their own data to make any pronouncements. That’s because the data is incomplete. Not every driver in a fatal crash is tested for drugs. Colorado law long allowed a conviction based on just drunken driving – at .08 percent blood alcohol level – so some agencies never bothered with any additional testing. The state only began tracking drugged driving – driving high – this year, so there is no historical data to compare, Ford said. ""We do not draw an incredible amount of conclusions from that data,"" she said. The federal data for all states likewise focuses on drunken, not drugged, drivers. Several studies show that marijuana can slow reaction time and similarly impair drivers in much the way alcohol does. One study found that dead drivers were three times more likely to test positive for cannabis in 2010 when compared to those who died in 1999.  But the marijuana will show up longer in blood work and does not appear to increase the chances of a fatal accident as much as booze, according to a 2013 study by researchers at Columbia University. So if Georgia were to legalize smoking marijuana, does that mean there would not be a rash of high drivers risking their safety and that of others? Colorado’s research indicates specific drivers – essentially young men – are more likely to drive high when the drug is legal. The state has launched a public awareness campaign to the new law that allows police to cite those motorists for driving under the influence, Ford said. In other words, there are clear dangers to driving under the influence of marijuana, much as there are for driving intoxicated. But while a regional report claims that those risks have led to a 100 percent increase in fatal crashes where the driver tested positive for cannabis, official state figures directly contradict those figures. Spahos was citing that published report, but the report and figures surrounding the topic are flawed",Half True,"December 15, 2014"
"Unlike marijuana, medical cannabis oil cannot get you high.","State lawmakers have a month before they get back to work in the 2015 legislative session and already the debate over medical marijuana has gotten into the, ahem, weeds. State Rep. Allen Peake, R-Macon serves as co-chair of a joint legislative committee that has studied whether and how to legalize the drug for certain conditions, including seizures in children. Peake has revived a bill aimed at allowing cannabis oil made from marijuana plants for treatment of certain seizure disorders and other health problems. He is finalizing that proposal, pre-filed as House Bill 1 after a similar measure fell short last session. But another committee member, state Sen. Curt Thompson, D-Tucker, is proposing a competing bill that would allow vaporized, edible or smokable marijuana. Thompson also has filed a resolution, calling for a statewide referendum on whether to authorize recreational use of the drug. Confusion about the oil form versus a smokeable drug has prompted Peake, who said he does not support expanded use, to speak out. ""We believe that the medical cannabis oil –  very low in THC, that doesn’t have a psychoactive component to it, cannot get you high – is a better approach for our citizens,"" Peake said in a press conference before a committee meeting last week. Opponents of the oil have raised safety concerns. So PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a closer look at  Peake’s contention that the oil extracted from marijuana won’t get users high. First, a reminder that the federal government still classifies marijuana as a Schedule I substance, defined as ""the most dangerous"" drug ""with no currently accepted medical use."" Despite that designation, 23 states have legalized medical marijuana, allowing access to the drug for a variety of medical conditions. Another 11 states – including neighboring Alabama, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee  – have enacted laws allowing cannabis oil products for medical reasons in limited situations. The key difference in allowing the oil, supporters say, is that it is high in cannabidiol and low in tetrahydrocannabinol. Both are compounds found in the marijuana plant that act on cell receptors that control neurotransmitters in the brain and the immune system from various organs, such as the spleen. Cannabidiol, known as CBD, is an antioxidant and not psychoactive. Tetrahydrocannabinol or THC is the long-known mind-altering part of pot. Cannabis oil is made from strains of marijuana already bred to be high in CBD and low in THC. For medical use, the oil is made with less than 3 percent THC and is orally ingested. Children’s doses tend to be at 1 percent THC, or lower. Studies are scarce on the medical benefits of such a product, given the Schedule I classification. But research does show that THC is what brings both it and CBD into the brain, where CBD’s antioxidant properties are thought to protect the brain. That evidence helped the federal Department of Health and Human Services earn a patent on medical marijuana in 2003. Anecdotally, parents of children with epilepsy and other seizure diseases back up the findings, reporting marked improvement from the cannabis oil. A London drug company, GW Pharmaceuticals, has created a drug out of highly purified CBD that has shown in preclinical studies that it potentially reduce seizures. The firm is waiting on final approval from Georgia Regents University and the federal Drug Enforcement Administration to begin clinical trials in Georgia with children who have severe seizure disorders. None of the existing studies or anecdotes from parents acknowledge or report any ""high"" from cannabis oil. Even the National Institute on Drug Abuse, while acknowledging the federal government does not see marijuana as medicine, reports that CBD as a ""non-psychoactive cannabinoid"" that may prove useful in treating epilepsy as well as some inflamation disorders and mental illnesses. In other words, while the medical use of cannabis oil can be debated given the limited number of medical and clinic studies, there is some common ground on the product. Marijuana remains officially a more dangerous drug than cocaine, according to the federal government. But the main component of the plant used to make cannabis oil doesn’t have the mind-altering, munchies-inducing effect associated with street use of the plant",True,"December 9, 2014"
"""There are more African American men in prison, jail, on probation or parole than were enslaved in 1850.""","A Brown University student leader offered a provocative historical comparison at the beginning of a Nov. 18, 2014, forum on the efficacy of taxing and regulating marijuana in Rhode Island. ""There are more African-American men in prison, jail, on probation or parole than were enslaved in 1850,"" said Diego Arene-Morley, president of Brown University Students for Sensible Drug Policy. Arene-Morley made the statement to highlight that African-American and Hispanic men are arrested at disproportionate rates under the current drug laws. We wondered whether Arene-Morley got his numbers right, so we asked him what he based his statement on.  We also reached out to the Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Statistics and the national nonprofit advocacy group, The Sentencing Project, for current figures. And we contacted the U.S. Census Bureau and the Rhode Island Historical Society for data about slavery in 1850. The Census of 1850 showed that 872,924 male African-American slaves over age 15 lived in the United States at that time. (The same Census found that there were a total of 3.2 million African-American slaves of all ages, at a time when the total U.S. population, including slaves and ""free coloreds,"" was 23.2 million.) How does that compare with the number of African-American men now under some sort of judicial system supervision? According to the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, there were 526,000 African-American men serving time in state or federal correctional facilities in 2013. (That’s 37 percent of the overall 1.5 million imprisoned men.) That represented almost 3 percent of the overall black male population in the United States, compared with .5 percent of white males, according to the bureau. There were 877,000 African-American men on probation in 2013, according to the bureau. And there were 280,000 African-American male parolees. (Probation is part of a criminal sentence that allows an offender to remain under supervision in the community instead of jail. Parole is the supervised release of an inmate from jail before his or her official release date.) In total, there were about 1.68 million African-American men under state and federal criminal justice supervision in 2013, 807,076 more than the number of African-American men who were enslaved in 1850. Marc Mauer, executive director of The Sentencing Project, provided a somewhat higher estimate for the number of African-American men now imprisoned or on probation and parole. His number, which includes those serving time in local jails, was about 1.88 million, more than 1 million above the 1850 figure. For the Rhode Island perspective, we asked the state Department of Corrections for its numbers. As of Oct. 10, there were 932 African-American men sentenced or awaiting trial in Rhode Island out of 3,108 male inmates overall. In addition, 4,285 African-American men were on probation; 87 on parole; and 4 are on lifetime supervision, according to spokeswoman Susan Lamkins. That totals 5,308, or 11 percent of the 48,542 black or African-American men in Rhode Island 18 years or older, according to the Census estimates as of July 1, 2013. When Arene-Morley got back to us, he referred us to the book ""The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness"" by Michelle Alexander and to an interview with Alexander featured on the Huffington Post website. The Huffington Post piece attributes to Alexander a statement the more black men are behind bars or under the watch of the criminal justice system than there were enslaved in 1850. Our ruling  Arene-Morley said that ""There are more African American men in prison, jail, on probation or parole than were enslaved in 1850."" Our research found that U.S. Bureau of Criminal Statistics put the number of African American men under state and federal criminal justice supervision in 2013 at about 1.68 million -- 807,076 above the number of African American men enslaved in 1850. The Sentencing Project, too, puts that number at 1.88 million with local jails factored in",True,"December 7, 2014"
"Under a proposed medical marijuana amendment in Florida, ""you don't get refills -- you get it forever.""","Opponents have made many arguments against Florida’s proposed medical marijuana amendment, but here’s a new one: They say patients would be able to get an unlimited amount of pot should the measure pass. Dr. Rafael Miguel, director of the Sarasota Memorial Institute for Advanced Medicine's Pain Medicine Program, was one of three representatives for Drug Free America who visited the Tampa Bay Times editorial board on Aug. 20. He joined Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri and Tallahassee attorney Susan Kelsey to discuss why the Sunshine State should shy away from Amendment 2 in November. Miguel offered several reasons why the medical establishment did not like the constitutional amendment. He said there was an unreasonable focus on marijuana’s smokeable form in order to obtain psychoactive effects, and added that the process by which doctors help patients get cannabis flies in the face of the prescription model of doling out drugs. Miguel focused on how ""recommendations"" to use marijuana are not prescriptions, and that they don’t allow doctors to control the amount and dosage patients consume, or for how long they consume it. ""You don't get refills -- you get it forever,"" Miguel said. ""There's no regulation on consumption."" PolitiFact Florida has written about the amendment’s guidelines before, but we were curious in this case whether doctors who recommend medical marijuana to patients would indeed have no say in how much or for how long their patients could take it. Following guidelines Medical marijuana is legal in 23 states and the District of Columbia. (Colorado and Washington state have gone a step further by legalizing cannabis for recreational use, even though the cultivation, possession and use of the drug remains against federal law.) Doctors in states that allow medical marijuana don’t prescribe the drug -- that could potentially lead to federal sanctions, since the U.S. government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug. Inclusion on that list means, legally, that marijuana has no known medical benefits, even though that claim is much disputed. Instead, in states that allow medical marijuana, doctors recommend people who suffer from certain approved conditions -- typically diseases like cancer, Parkinson’s disease, ALS, or other conditions causing chronic pain. States make their own rules for supplying the drug that vary from state to state. Florida’s Amendment 2 says that, should the initiative pass, the state Department of Health would create guidelines for the manufacture, distribution and use of marijuana. That worries opponents like Drug Free America; they argue that the language is too broad to limit the scope of the drug’s impact on the state. Miguel didn’t immediately return PolitiFact Florida’s request for more specifics about what he meant. During his editorial board visit he made it clear he preferred the FDA-approved process of writing prescriptions with a specified dosage, duration, potency and number of refills, using clinically tested drugs. The amendment doesn’t give doctors any of that control, Miguel said, and it doesn’t define any limit. In general, the measure says the state Department of Health will create regulations. However, the initiative does lay out some of the process. It defines a written ""physician certification"" as a document that says the doctor feels the patient has a condition that may be aided by the use of cannabis and specifies ""for how long the physician recommends the medical use of marijuana for the patient."" There also is a section that requires the Florida Department of Health to create ""a regulation that defines the amount of marijuana that could reasonably be presumed to be an adequate supply for qualifying patients’ medical use, based on the best available evidence."" That limit on quantity could be waived, depending on the patient’s condition. The language prevents a strict interpretation of how involved a doctor would be, said attorney Kelsey, who has criticized the amendment for being so vague it would eventually be challenged in the state supreme court. ""As I read it, the doctor doesn’t say the amount at all,"" Kelsey said. ""He just gives the patient the certification and it says for how long, then the patient gets their ID card and takes that to the dispensary and that is the point at which the quantity is determined and handed out."" So how is the drug distributed in states that allow it? Every state has different regulations for the process, but a good benchmark for Florida may be Nevada, because it passed medical marijuana as a constitutional amendment instead of as legislation. Colorado adopted constitutional amendments in 2000 and 2014, but the second one legalized recreational use, which the Florida Amendment does not do. Passed by voters in 2000, the Nevada amendment language was even shorter and more vague than the Florida proposal. It required the state Legislature to provide for a registry and to create guidelines, a process delegated to the state Department of Health and Human Services in subsequent legislation. As of 2013, Nevada limited patients to 2.5 ounces of marijuana every 14 days. Patients must get an ID card through a registry, and must renew their membership on the registry with a doctor’s approval every year. Even in states that allow patients to grow their own marijuana plants, there are legal limits to how much they can cultivate. It’s a moot point in Florida, because the amendment doesn’t allow for personal cultivation. Many laws or regulations also say doctors can tell the state agency in charge if they think a patient would no longer benefit from medical marijuana, according to Karen O’Keefe, state policy director at the Marijuana Policy Project, which favors regulations like Amendment 2. ""In most cases, the laws also specify that the card becomes void if the patient ceases to have the qualifying condition,"" O’Keefe said. ""I see no reason why regulators couldn’t include similar provisions in Florida."" Our ruling Miguel said when it comes to doctor’s recommendations for medical marijuana, ""You don't get refills, you get it forever."" He was referring to how a doctor’s ""recommendation"" for cannabis does not allow the same level of control as a medical prescription does. He said there was no written limitation on how much or for how long a patient could get marijuana in the amendment, a common criticism by opponents of the amendment. It’s possible that potential Florida regulations would not limit time on a registry or how long a doctor’s certification would last for a patient. But it would be premature, and speculative, to assume that there would be no way under the amendment to stop a recommendation from going on forever. Other states have created their own rules, limiting the quantity and frequency of the drug that patients can get. They also limit how long patients can be on a registry before requiring a doctor’s approval",Mostly False,"August 28, 2014"
"""We’ve seen highway fatalities actually decrease in Colorado"" since marijuana use was legalized.","Oregon voters will have the chance in November to join only Colorado and Washington as states where recreational use of marijuana is legal. Not surprisingly, the issue is already heating up, with those for and against staking out positions they hope will sway voters on Measure 91. The claim: Anthony Johnson, the measure’s chief petitioner and director of the advocacy group New Approach Oregon, made his pitch recently when the City Club of Portland met to debate the merits of nine political issues, legal marijuana among them. When an opposition speaker questioned why Oregon should follow the lead of Colorado and Washington into the relatively uncharted territory of legal pot, Johnson noted the pluses of regulation and taxation. Addressing opposition predictions that driving accidents would spike in those states, he added, ""We've seen highway fatalities actually decrease in Colorado"" since recreational use of marijuana became legal there in January. Since the effect legalization might have on impaired driving is a big topic in Oregon in the lead up to November, PolitiFact Oregon checked the numbers. The analysis: Colorado’s medical marijuana law took effect in 2002, giving the Centennial State a relatively long history of dealing with the drug in an other-than-illegal capacity. However, recreational use has been in effect for only seven months, making any numbers suspect in terms of how longer-term trends might play out. That said, we figured that comparing the number of traffic fatalities recorded during the first seven months of this year with the first seven of 2013 would the fairest way to evaluate Johnson’s claim. We called Emily Wilfong, a Colorado Department of Transportation spokeswoman. As of Aug. 22, 2014, she said, 295 people had died in motor vehicle crashes in the state. That compared with the 313 deaths reported as of the same time a year ago. A difference, yes, but one of less than six percent. But even so, Wilfong added, those two figures don’t reveal a useful picture when it comes to assessing traffic deaths in the age of legal marijuana. For starters, neither figure includes the icy dangers of Colorado’s winter driving season, which begins around mid- to late-October, she said. Hazardous conditions could easily skew the number of traffic fatalities dramatically. For another, neither includes an analysis of exactly how the deaths occurred. ""There could well be a big decrease in the number of pedestrian fatalities,"" Wilfong said. ""There’s nothing in these figures to show that impaired driving has been reduced to any measurable degree."" Muddying the numbers further is the fact that toxicology reports showing what drivers had in their systems may not come back for months, she said. ""So we have some numbers,"" Wilfong said, ""but we’re not at all certain what they mean at this point. It’s way too early to tell."" Trooper Josh Lewis, Wilfong’s Colorado State Patrol counterpart, agreed. ""Statistically, we’re essentially neck and neck with last year,"" he said. ""But there’s nothing to say that marijuana use is reducing the number of fatalities or that there’s any correlation between the two. It could well be months or years before we have gathered that sort of data."" We tried to reach Johnson, but were told he was out of the office. The Yes on 91 campaign referred us to Art Way, senior drug policy manager of the Drug Policy Alliance (Colorado). Over the past decade, he said -- or roughly the time that Colorado began loosening its marijuana laws -- total highway fatalities are down. Statistics bear that out, but the margin is slim and there are other factors such as improvements in vehicle safety and trauma medicine. The ruling: Anthony Johnson, chief petitioner for Measure 91, which would legalize recreational marijuana use in Oregon, pointed to Colorado’s brief seven-month experience with legal pot and noted that traffic fatalities have decreased there over that stretch. Colorado’s most recent statistics show that 18 fewer people have died so far this year in fatal traffic accidents than did during that same time period in 2013. Nothing in those numbers, however, supports any contention that legal marijuana had anything to do with a drop that’s as much as a blip as anything. Johnson’s statement is true, but it omits important details and context",Half True,"August 22, 2014"
"""The best evidence is that you lose -- if you use marijuana as a teenager regularly -- eight IQ points.""","About two dozen states have moved to loosen the reins on marijuana. The legal ground is shifting and a New York Times Sunday editorial tried to shake things up a bit further. For more than 40 years, federal law has banned pot and lawmakers in many states have voiced reluctance to run afoul of Washington. The paper’s editorial board said the federal government should be silent on marijuana and let states decide for themselves. Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus said she was okay with letting states experiment, but in a discussion on NBC’s Meet the Press on July 27, 2014, Marcus said she was against letting states ""go the full legalization route."" Her main concern with state’s loosening the rules had to do with teenagers. ""It is a vast social experiment,"" Marcus said. ""We do not know the outcome except that the best evidence is that you lose -- if you use marijuana as a teenager regularly -- eight IQ points."" We didn’t hear from Marcus, but we’re pretty sure she is citing a 2012 study from Duke University researchers published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The Duke team led by Madeline Meier studied nearly every child born in the New Zealand town of Dunedin born in the early 1970s. By the time they turned 13, these children had taken their first IQ tests. Follow-up interviews as they grew older determined if they were using marijuana, alcohol or other drugs. They took another battery of IQ tests when they turned 38. The Duke researchers screened out those who had problems with hard drugs, alcohol or schizophrenia. They controlled for the kids who dropped out of school. What they found was the ones who began smoking pot weekly before they turned 18 showed an average drop of about eight IQ points. Some lost more and some lost less but all lost at least a bit. ""Impairment was concentrated among adolescent-onset cannabis users, with more persistent use associated with greater decline,"" the researchers wrote. The study didn’t say this proved that that early and long-term use caused the drop in IQ results. Researchers acknowledged that some unknown variable might be responsible. At the same time, they said it was plausible that pot could be disrupting brain development in teenagers. The report attracted a fair bit of attention. Then, about a year later, another analysis emerged, again published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. This one came from Ole Rogeberg, a Norwegian economist, who said he could get the same results as Meier by factoring in socioeconomic status. In short, Rogeberg said the kids from poorer households would lose ground on IQ tests over time because they tended to end up doing work that was less mentally demanding. ""The causal effects estimated in Meier et al. are likely to be overestimates and the true effect could be zero,"" Rogeberg wrote. ""Although it would be too strong to say that the results have been discredited, the methodology is flawed and the causal inference drawn from the results premature."" Meier shot back that Rogeberg had relied on an economic model and that when her team looked at the incomes of the families, they still found a loss in intelligence that was tied to marijuana. In particular, children from middle-class households were more likely to see a drop in their IQ scores if they started smoking pot early and continued as they aged. However, there was no mention of how large the drop was or how statistically robust it was. Annette Dobson, a statistician at the University of Queensland, commented on the debate. Dobson largely weighed in on Rogeberg’s side, saying the number of long-term pot users in the Dunedin group was small, only 124 reported regular use at any time. ""I suspect that the small sample size limited the extent to which the authors were able to take possible confounding factors, such as socioeconomic status, into account,"" Dobson wrote. ""So are the original results by Meier et al. correct? I don’t believe we can say whether they are or not."" Our ruling Marcus said the best evidence shows that teenagers who start smoking marijuana will lose eight IQ points. This overstates the actual underlying report. It would be more accurate to say the study showed a higher risk of losing that many points on an IQ test, not that a person necessarily would. More fundamentally, an equally reputable analysis found that IQ loss could be tied to household incomes as much as marijuana use.  Clearly, a scientific consensus has yet to emerge, and Marcus ignored the ongoing debate",Half True,"July 27, 2014"
76 percent of doctors support the use of medical marijuana,"An initiative proposing to legalize recreational marijuana in Oregon is headed for the November ballot. Signature verification by the Oregon Secretary of State’s office wrapped up Tuesday, with enough valid names turned in on petitions passed by New Approach Oregon to send the proposal to voters. The claim: The pro-pot group, on its Facebook page, recently posted a statistic indicating that physicians back the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes. ""Did you know...76 percent of doctors support the use of medical marijuana,"" reads the claim. PolitiFact Oregon checked. The analysis: New Approach Oregon’s claim that more than three out of four doctors ""support"" medicinal use of marijuana was attributed to a May 2013 survey published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine. The poll was conducted online. Unlike scientifically designed surveys, those who responded were not chosen at random but rather volunteered to participate. We checked the survey, which asked doctors, hypothetically, whether they would prescribe marijuana to help alleviate the suffering of a 68-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer. The study’s authors, both physicians, wrote they were surprised by the outcome -- 76 percent said yes. Although participation in the survey was global, 1,063 of the 1,446 votes came from the U.S., Canada and Mexico. ""Analysis of voting across all regions of North America showed that 76 percent of voters supported medicinal marijuana,"" the study’s authors wrote. The low end of support came from Utah, where only 1 vote in 76 supported medical pot. Pennsylvania represented the other extreme, with 102 of 107 votes in support. The study’s authors took a fairly specific situation -- the plight of a suffering 68-year-old -- and extrapolated the votes to indicate that 76 percent of physicians generally support medicinal marijuana. That’s a bit of a broad brush. However, the authors, Drs. Jonathan N. Adler and James A. Colbert, also noted that many votes came with explanations that went beyond that one hypothetical. ""Many pointed out the known dangers of prescription narcotics, supported patient choice, or described personal experience with patients who benefited from the use of marijuana,"" they wrote. Those who opposed medical marijuana, by contrast, ""targeted the lack of evidence, the lack of provenance, inconsistency of dosage, and concern about side effects, including psychosis."" Invited by the authors to write a rebuttal, Drs. Robert L. DuPont and Gary M. Reisfield noted that marijuana can cause lung damage, further harming anyone who already has breathing problems. We checked for additional national surveys assessing physicians’ views toward medical marijuana. The most prominent effort was published April 2, 2014, on WebMD’s website. Of 1,544 doctors surveyed, 69 percent said marijuana can help with certain treatments and conditions; 67 percent said it should be a medical option for patients; and 56 percent supported making it legal nationwide. The survey, drawn from doctors representing more than 12 specialty areas, reported a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percent. However, as with the New England Journal of Medicine survey, this effort was voluntary, self-selected and unscientific. The survey and poll come as 23 states, including Oregon, and the District of Columbia have now legalized medical marijuana, with eight of those states signing on in just the past three years. We contacted the Oregon Medical Association to see where Beaver State physicians stand on the issue. ""We don’t recommend participation in medical marijuana,"" Gwen Dayton, the organization’s general counsel and vice president for health policy, wrote in an email. ""If a physician wants to, fine, but if they ask us whether they should or not, we don’t recommend it."" Asked about the national survey, Dayton said, ""They are an esteemed publication. I’d never say anything they print is nonsense."" The American Medical Association takes much the same view. While the association is calling for more research into marijuana’s effectiveness as a medical option, it has no language that would give doctors a green light to prescribe it, Kelly Jakubek, the AMA’s public information officer, wrote in an email. We called Liz Kaufman, New Approach Oregon’s campaign director. She said the journal of medicine’s article was posted on New Approach’s Facebook page not because the statistic is viewed as a scientific finding, but because it brings attention to the issue. ""This was a study published in the journal, not conducted by it,"" Kaufman said. ""Nor was it a telephone survey. It came from a self-selected set of doctors who gave opinions as individuals. We weren’t making a statement about the New England Journal of Medicine. This is just an article we’re bringing attention to."" New Approach Oregon’s stated reason on Facebook was to highlight that its measure wouldn’t change anything regarding medical marijuana. ""Our campaign knows that doctors know what’s right for their patients,"" the post reads. ""That’s why the New Approach initiative makes no changes to Oregon’s medical marijuana program."" The ruling: New Approach Oregon, a group backing an initiative to legalize the recreational use of marijuana in the state, claimed on its Facebook page that ""76 percent of doctors approve of medical marijuana use."" The figure comes from an unscientific survey published in one of the country’s most reputable health publications. Participants chose to take part and were not drawn from a random sample. New Approach Oregon offered no nuance with its posting, including the fact that the study was not scientific, nor that it was based on a single hypothetical example. The associations representing most physicians in both Oregon and the U.S. are making no such call, at least for now, that marijuana should be a treatment option for doctors.

He responded with statistics and a link to the 2012 Oregon Annual Uniform Crime Report, which has comprehensive crime numbers. A table with the heading ""Statewide Drug Law Arrests by Type of Drug and Activity - 2012"" shows, for marijuana, the number New Approach Oregon cited: 12,808.
 
But Hastings noted in his email that 10,054 of those people were cited for possessing less than an ounce of marijuana -- ""a violation (but) not a criminal offense.""
 
""It is important to note,"" he continued, ""that enforcement action in the case of a 'violation' is handled by the issuance of a citation, similar to a traffic citation for speeding or not wearing a safety belt. Someone cannot be taken into custody and lodged in jail for a violation offense.""
 
In other words, Hastings said, those 10,054 were cited, not arrested. That leaves 2,754 people arrested for marijuana crimes in 2012, not 12,808.
 
The 10,054 figure is also in the state report, in a row listing those found with less than an ounce of marijuana.
 
So why is the figure for violations listed under an ""arrests"" heading? Hastings, after consulting with a state police researcher, said Oregon's report is part of the FBI's national Uniform Crime Reporting Program, which includes information from more than 18,000 agencies nationwide.
 
Each state must use the FBI's reporting requirements, which have only one field for ""arrested, cited, referred, or summoned."" Oregon separately tracks whether marijuana offenses involved more or less than an ounce, and includes that in another place in the report.
 
On July 14, 2014, we called Peter Zuckerman, spokesman for New Approach Oregon and a former news reporter who worked at The Oregonian from 2007 to  2009. He pointed to the Oregon Uniform Crime Report and the ""arrests"" wording. Told about Hasting's comments, he said he would look into the numbers.
 
In an email later that day, he stood by the 12,808 figure, saying it was the most accurate available. He said violations can technically be ""noncustodial arrests,"" a term police sometimes use to describe when someone is stopped but not detained.
 
By then, Hastings had explained to Zuckerman why the 12,808 figure was incorrect. In emails shared by Zuckerman, Hastings wrote on July 7, 2014: ""I want to make sure it is clear to you that Possession of less than an Ounce of Marijuana is a violation in Oregon, not a crime. A violation is only handled by issuance of citation (similar to a traffic citation) and someone cannot be taken into custody for a violation. Even though it is listed as an 'arrest' in this report, it is not a 'custodial arrest.'""
 
On July 8, Hastings sent Zuckerman the legal definition of an arrest in Oregon: ""to place a person under actual or constructive restraint or to take a person into custody for the purpose of charging that person with an offense.""
 
Over multiple emails and phone calls to PolitiFact Oregon from July 14-17, 2014, Zuckerman continued to quibble over the definition of ""arrest."" He sometimes acknowledged that the 12,808 figure is incorrect but other times said ""if"" it's wrong, it's the fault of Oregon State Police.
 
He noted that people can be arrested for possessing less than an ounce of marijuana if they're near a school or on parole but did not provide statistics to show what effect, if any, that would have on the 12,808 figure. Hastings said parole violations would be counted elsewhere and that possessing less than an ounce of pot near a school would not necessarily result in an arrest. He also said he doesn't hear of such arrests often.
 
Ultimately, Zuckerman said New Approach Oregon should not be held responsible for promoting the number because it relied on a credible source - the state police - and followed up when the number seemed inflated.
 
""If it turns out the state police issued a misleading crime statistics report because of a communications problem they have with the FBI, and then gave me bad information about custodial vs. noncustodial arrest, that's not our fault,"" Zuckerman wrote. ""It's unreasonable to think we would or could have known that.""
 
The claim remained on the organization's website as of Friday afternoon.
 
The ruling: New Approach Oregon claims 12,808 people were arrested in 2012 for marijuana-related offenses, citing a ""Drug Law Arrests"" listing in Oregon's Annual Uniform Crime Report. State police spokesman Lt. Gregg Hastings told PolitiFact Oregon and New Approach spokesman Peter Zuckerman that the number includes 10,054 people who were cited - but not arrested -- for possessing less than an ounce of marijuana, leaving the actual number of arrests in 2012 at 2,754. While the way the number is listed in the state report is confusing, officials have clarified the record",False,"July 18, 2014"
"Says Charlie Crist signed ""the nation’s harshest marijuana laws.""","A radio ad attacking former Gov. Charlie Crist accuses him of signing the nation’s ""harshest marijuana laws."" And it’s aimed at a voting bloc that overwhelmingly sides with Democrats: African-Americans. ""While Crist was coddling the gun lobby, he was cracking down on us,"" says the ad from Progressive Choice Florida, a 501(c)4 group that’s been attacking Crist from the left. "" Passing maximum sentencing laws. Signing the nation’s harshest marijuana laws. And enacting the country’s strictest penalties against non-violent offenders – many of whom just happen to be black."" We wanted to know if Crist had signed ""the nation’s harshest marijuana laws."" That claim caught our attention because one of Crist’s chief backers is attorney John Morgan, who’s been bankrolling a campaign urging a constitutional amendment to allow medical marijuana. Our research showed that Florida is tough on those busted for pot, but that reputation began long before Crist was governor. Marijuana law during Crist’s tenure Progressive Choice Floridapointed to two bills signed by Crist: House Bill 173, the Marijuana Grow House Eradication Act in 2008, and the so-called ""Bong Bill"" outlawing drug paraphernalia in 2010. The grow house law made it a second-degree felony to grow 25 or more plants; the previous law set the threshold at 300 plants. The bill also allowed law enforcement to destroy bulky grow house equipment and simply take photos or video. While law enforcement widely supported the bill, advocates for marijuana and the ACLU of Florida opposed it. The bill passed the Senate unanimously and only one representative, Broward Democrat Evan Jenne, voted against it. Jenne told PolitiFact Florida that he opposed the provision that allowed law enforcement to destroy evidence. Though Crist signed the bill, the champion of it was then-Republican Attorney General Bill McCollum, who two years later lost a primary in the governor’s race against Scott. William Shepherd, who worked for McCollum at the time, said he doesn’t know what ""harshest"" would mean or how Florida’s law compared to other states. (The federal standard was 100 plants.) However, he said the grow house bill was a major change for Florida. ""We definitely ramped up the marijuana production laws,"" he said. In March 2008, Crist told a Miami Herald reporter that he favored Florida's tough drug laws and didn't support reviewing whether to lessen penalties for some crimes such as nonviolent drug possession. Two years later, the bong bill made it a crime to sell smoking devices such as pipes and bongs at most head shops. We found no evidence that Crist pushed hard for the bill, which he signed after the Legislature unanimously passed it in 2010. Were Florida laws 'harshest'?  We reached out to experts on marijuana laws to ask if Florida held some sort of record for having ""the nation’s harshest marijuana laws."" Comparing state drug policies is difficult at best, because each state codifies offenses and sentences in different ways, according to Tamar Todd, an attorney with the pro-decriminalization Drug Policy Alliance. ""One of the challenges of cross-state comparison is that some states might be harsher, in that cultivation of any amount is a felony with a harsh sentence, but at the same time cultivation in the presence of a minor is not a separate more serious offense,"" Todd said. ""Other states classify crimes differently than degrees of felonies."" He added that how much time offenders actually get may differ, because states often employ diversion programs or habitual offender statutes, muddying the waters concerning sentencing records. Other advocates for legalizing at least some uses of marijuana or reforming marijuana laws told PolitiFact Florida that the state had long had a reputation for tough marijuana laws -- and that didn’t suddenly occur when Crist was governor. Allen St. Pierre, executive director of NORML which advocates for reform of marijuana laws, pointed to a handful of states that he said have laws that are equally or more harsh than Florida’s including Georgia, Texas, Idaho, Missouri and Wyoming. ""Florida, ever since the early 1980s, has historically (and) traditionally always had pretty harsh laws,"" St. Pierre said. The bills Crist signed as governor didn’t change Florida’s reputation in terms of marijuana laws, he said. ""In general, no drug policy reform group, including NORML, viewed the passage of the 2008 anti-cultivation laws as being particularly harsh as much as we did out-of-touch with where most rest of the country is moving politically on cannabis policy,"" St. Pierre told PolitiFact Florida. Paul Armentano, deputy director of NORML, wrote an article in 2011 about ""The Five Worst states to get busted with pot."" The ""top 5,"" in order of severity, were Oklahoma, Texas, Florida, Louisiana and Arizona. ""No other state routinely punishes minor marijuana more severely than does the Sunshine State,"" he wrote. ""Under Florida law, marijuana possession of 20 grams or less (about two-thirds of an ounce) is a criminal misdemeanor punishable by up to one-year imprisonment and a $1,000 fine. Marijuana possession over 20 grams, as well as the cultivation of even a single pot plant, are defined by law as felony offenses – punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine."" A Progressive Choice Florida spokeswoman cited an analysis of state laws and sentencing guidelines written by Jon Gettman, a former NORML director. He wrote that, ""The states with the most severe overall penalties for marijuana possession are (in order of severity) Florida, Montana, Arkansas, Georgia and Oregon (tied) and Missouri."" But Gettman’s article was based on 2007 arrests and laws in place before Crist was governor. NORML board member Florida attorney Norm Kent told PolitiFact Florida that he considers our state’s laws ""draconian and amongst the toughest"" but doesn’t consider Florida the worst in the nation. (Kent endorsed Crist earlier this year.) ""What happens on the third strike in Texas is you can get life in prison if it’s a marijuana charge,"" he said. Our ruling A radio ad says that Charlie Crist signed ""the nation’s harshest marijuana laws."" As governor, Crist signed laws that cracked down on grow houses and bong sales. But both bills sailed through the Legislature without any particular advocacy from Crist. In both cases, the laws didn’t change Florida’s pre-existing reputation as having tough marijuana laws",Mostly False,"June 27, 2014"
"Judging by a recent vote, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ""thinks it's okay for medical marijuana patients to go to federal prison.""","If you’re a South Florida senior citizen suffering from a deadly disease and you’re hoping to ease your pain with a puff of marijuana, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Weston, has a prescription for you: federal prison. At least that’s the impression created by a TV ad launched in June by Americans for Safe Access, a group that supports medical marijuana. The ad airing through June 10 in Broward and Miami-Dade counties attacks Wasserman Schultz for her recent vote against a medical marijuana amendment. The visuals include a photo of an elderly woman who has ALS alongside her husband, who’s wearing a veterans cap. (Here’s some separate information from PolitiFact Florida about that ALS patient, Cathy Jordan, featured in the ad.) ""Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz thinks it's okay for medical marijuana patients to go to federal prison,"" the narrator states. ""On May 30, she voted against an amendment that would respect Florida’s new laws and protect Florida’s patients. Even though 88 percent of voters support medical marijuana, why would Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz vote to send patients like this to prison? Is Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz out of touch with Florida?"" The group is running a similar TV attack against U.S. Rep. Andy Harris, R-Maryland. Wasserman Schultz, who chairs the Democratic National Committee, represents a large elderly population in South Florida. So an ad suggesting that she wants to send ailing seniors to federal prison packs a punch. We decided to take a look at the vote cited in the ad. The medical marijuana amendment  The ad cites a vote on an amendment to H.R. 4660, an appropriations -- or funding -- bill for departments of Commerce and Justice and science agencies. The amendment, offered by U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., bans the use of federal money to prevent certain states from implementing their own medical marijuana laws. The amendment states: ""None of the funds made available in this Act to the Department of Justice may be used, with respect to the States of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, to prevent such States from implementing their own State laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana."" These are largely the states where some form of medical marijuana is allowed or pending -- or in the case of Florida, is on the ballot this fall. The language was designed to expire at the end of fiscal year 2015, so a similar amendment would have to be offered each year, at which point additional states considering medical marijuana laws could be added. Wasserman Schultz was one of 17 Democrats in the House to vote against the amendment, which ended up passing, 219-189, on May 30. All told, 49 Republicans and 170 Democrats supported the amendment. ""I voted against the Farr-Rohrabacher amendment because I do not believe, regardless of the issue, that it is appropriate to limit the executive branch’s ability to enforce current federal law at their discretion,"" Wasserman Schultz said in a statement, in which she also raised concerns about Florida’s ballot initiative to allow medical marijuana. (Her concerns about the ballot measure have drawn the wrath of John Morgan, a major Democratic donor who is funding that amendment.) A Wasserman Schultz spokesman sent us the statement but declined to comment specifically on the ad’s claim that she wants to send patients to prison. Though proponents of medical marijuana cast the House’s affirmative vote on the amendment as a major victory after years of efforts, it still has to clear two major hurdles: the Senate and President Barack Obama. As of June 9, the amendment had no Senate sponsor, though Americans for Safe Access said it was courting senators to introduce a similar amendment when the spending bill goes to the floor later this month. Current legal situation As PolitiFact Florida has previously written, the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970 classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug, meaning it has a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use. Proponents of decriminalizing marijuana strongly disagree with that definition. The law imposes strict penalties on marijuana users, growers and sellers. A first misdemeanor offense for possession in any amount can result in a $1,000 fine and a year in prison. Meanwhile, selling cannabis is considered a felony and can send a defendant to five years of prison, or even longer, depending on the amount and the circumstances. Cultivating cannabis plants carries similar penalties, based on the volume. Even with federal law on the books prohibiting marijuana, there are reasons that users and distributors aren’t constantly being busted by the Drug Enforcement Agency amid debate in many states about loosening laws governing medical uses -- or even recreational uses -- of marijuana. The 2005 U.S. Supreme Court case Gonzales vs. Raich established that the federal government has the right to use the Commerce Clause of the Constitution to regulate homegrown marijuana, even when it’s for approved medicinal use. The case addressed whether it was proper for DEA officials to destroy Oakland, Calif., resident Angel Raich’s homegrown marijuana plants in 2002, even though California’s medical marijuana law, passed in 1996, made them legal under state law. Since then, other states have continued to shrug off federal guidelines, with voters in Colorado and Washington state going so far as to decriminalize cannabis use outright last year. This has led to a recent softening of the federal government’s stance on the drug. In 2013, U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued a memorandum to federal attorneys that included new guidelines focusing on cartels or other criminal organizations -- for example, distribution to minors, cultivating plants on public land, committing violence to distribute the drug or using state-regulated operations as a cover for illicit activities. Beyond that, the Justice Department said it’s content to allow state and local agencies ""to address marijuana activity through enforcement of their own narcotics laws."" Indeed, raids of growing operations have grown infrequent, and federal prosecution of individuals in those states is nearly unheard of. Some argue that the House amendment merely codifies the Cole memo or still leaves prosecutors with wiggle room. However, proponents hope it will influence the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. ""It could provide for the opening to enact legislative language that would be much more specific,"" Jeff Vanderslice, Rorhabacher’s legislative director, told PolitiFact Florida. Examples of federal prosecution We asked Kris Hermes, a spokesman for Americans for Safe Access, if he could cite examples of medical marijuana patients being sent to federal prison. Hermes cited examples of marijuana busts in Montana, Michigan and California, but most of the cases involved large-scale cultivators and distributors. In some cases, prosecutors accused defendants of cultivating more plants than allowed under state law or selling for non-medical reasons. For example, Aaron Sandusky, who operated multiple dispensaries, was found guilty in 2012 of conspiracy and possession with intent to distribute hundreds of pounds of marijuana. The Press Enterprise wrote that federal investigators alleged Sandusky’s company used California's medical marijuana laws as a cover for an illegal grow-and-sell operation instead of a nonprofit cultivation collective for those with a doctor's recommendation to use marijuana. He was sentenced to 10 years. Rohrabacher’s staff cited the case of Jerry Duval who was sentenced to 10 years in prison in Michigan. Duval and his children were state-registered caregivers and their lawyers argued that they raised it for Duval, an organ transplant recipient. But federal prosecutors argued that they used medical marijuana as a front while peddling marijuana to non-patients. A jury found Duval, a convicted felon, and his son guilty of conspiracy to manufacture more than 100 marijuana plants, manufacturing marijuana plants with intent to distribute and maintaining a place to distribute marijuana under federal law. One case headed to trial that has drawn considerable attention involves the Kettle Falls 5, named for the defendants who grew about 70 plants in eastern Washington. Prosecutors say the five defendants were conspiring to manufacture and distribute marijuana and they were also charged with possessing firearms. The Safe Access group brought one codefendant, Larry Harvey, to D.C. to lobby Congress. Harvey, 70, told USA TODAY Network that he never sold any marijuana -- ""not a bit of it"" -- and the pot he grew was for personal medical use. He has a bad knee from years of long-haul trucking and his wife suffers from arthritis. Experts say prosecution permitted but rare We sent the ad to a few academic experts who study marijuana laws and asked about the likelihood of patients going to prison. ""I know of no patient-only person sent to federal prison for use of marijuana,"" Ohio State University professor Douglas Berman said. But he said the ""Kettle Falls Five"" case may be the closest, since it involves patients -- rather than distributors -- facing possible prison time. Even before states started legalizing marijuana for medical or recreational use, the federal government didn’t throw defendants in prison simply for using marijuana, Vanderbilt law Professor Robert Mikos told PolitiFact Florida. Prosecutors are focused on suppliers and distributors, he said. ""The way the ad is set up -- that the federal government is going to go after elderly people with chronic illnesses for using marijuana for medical purposes -- it’s just ridiculous,"" Mikos said. ""It never happens, and furthermore to say because someone voted a certain way on this amendment and therefore they support that (people going to prison only for using medical marijuana) is just a ridiculous stretch of logic."" That said, prosecution of patients is permitted under current federal law, said George Mason University law professor Ilya Somin. ""Even if such prosecutions rarely occur, the fact that they are possible is a deterrent for legitimate medical providers and suppliers from getting involved in the process. It also often deters banks from giving them financing."" Somin argues that while the Justice Department memo might cut back on prosecutions, it didn’t completely bar them. He added that ""this administration or a successor could reverse or modify those guidelines at any time. A new federal statute could prevent such a reversal."" Our ruling The ad by Americans for Safe Access says that, judging by a recent vote, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ""thinks it's okay for medical marijuana patients to go to federal prison""-- even the elderly ALS patient shown in the ad. We can't measure what Wasserman Schultz believes in her heart, but we are able to take a closer look at what her voting record shows. She did vote against an amendment to prevent the federal government from using money to keep certain states from decriminalizing medical marijuana. And laws that could theoretically send medical marijuana users to prison remain on the books. Still, it’s an exaggeration to say that Wasserman Schultz’s vote means she wants to send ailing seniors to prison for smoking a joint. The reality is that today, even without the amendment in force, federal prosecutions of medical marijuana users are exceedingly rare. Most of the prosecutions we found involved users who were also accused of dealing marijuana. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression",Mostly False,"June 10, 2014"
"""Marijuana is less addictive than both alcohol and tobacco.""","Marijuana use, both recreationally and medicinally, is a glowing dot on the nation’s political radar screen. Two states, Washington and Colorado, voted to legalize recreational use of the drug last year, and other states are contemplating following. The same is true in Oregon, where as many as three marijuana-related initiatives may be heading toward the November ballot. The claim: U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, on his official website, makes clear where he stands. The Oregon Democrat supports legislation that would allow states to enact marijuana laws without federal interference, remove the ban on industrial hemp and ""allow the marijuana industry to operate in a normal business environment."" Among the claims tucked under the heading ""The Facts about Marijuana"" is this: ""Marijuana is less addictive than both alcohol and tobacco."" Plenty has been written about all three substances, but with Oregon possibly facing one or more pot measures on the ballot this November, we decided to see if Blumenauer is right about marijuana’s addictive qualities. The analysis: We emailed Blumenauer’s office to ask about its sources for the claim. Spokesman Patrick Malone responded with a statement saying in part, ""We certainly always need more research on marijuana and its medicinal properties,"" but he offered no sourcing. Next we dug into PolitiFact’s database and found several claims that, while not precisely on point, added to our understanding. In one, John Morgan, the high-profile Florida attorney leading an effort to legalize medical marijuana in the Sunshine State, said ""nobody’s addicted"" to marijuana. When contacted by PolitiFact, Morgan corrected himself, saying, ""It was a huge mistake. I’m sorry and I messed up."" Experts contacted for that story agreed that marijuana can be addictive. Morgan’s claim was rated False. In another, a pro-pot group, also in Florida, claimed marijuana is ""less toxic"" than alcohol. The claim was rated Mostly True. Finally, there was a claim in Massachusetts that ""today’s marijuana is 300 percent to 800 percent more potent than the pot of yesteryear."" It was rated True. So, yes, marijuana can be addictive; yes, it’s less toxic than alcohol; and, yes, it’s far stronger than previous strains of the drug. We called Dr. J. Wesley Boyd, a faculty member at Harvard Medical School and a recognized expert on addiction issues. Narrowly construed, he said, what Blumenauer posted on his website is correct -- marijuana is less addictive than both alcohol and tobacco. ""But like a lot of things,"" Boyd added, ""the question is much more complicated than that. There are a lot of gray areas to all of this."" First, there’s the definition of ""addictive,"" since that’s the key to Blumenauer’s claim. ""For me,"" Boyd said, ""when someone is addicted to something, they feel a strong compulsion to use that substance even in the face of known harms that the substance causes them."" And marijuana is addictive, he said. Boyd cited research from the National Institute on Drug Abuse showing that about 9 percent of those who use marijuana become addicted. (Estimates from research suggest that 32 percent of tobacco users and 15 percent of alcohol users become addicted, according to the NIDA.) However, when it comes to withdrawal, alcohol is by far the worst of the three, he said. If someone is truly addicted to alcohol and tries to stop, Boyd said, the symptoms can be profound: heart and pulse rates through the roof, overwhelming anxiety, seizures and, in rare instances, ""a slim but possible chance of dying."" What about tobacco? ""It’s far closer to marijuana in terms of physical effects,"" he said. ""In both instances, regular users can feel, from a psychological standpoint, remarkably uncomfortable. Cravings, sleep disturbances and depression are common."" Other research confirmed what most people already know about the toll tobacco exacts on health. Smoking costs society at least $289 billion annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the lead federal agency for comprehensive tobacco prevention and control. There are no comparable figures for marijuana. We consulted three other sources, all of which agreed that marijuana is the lesser of addictive evils when compared with tobacco. In addition to a 2008 report issued by a British research foundation, both Dr. Neal L. Benowitz of the University of California at San Francisco and Dr. Jack E. Henningfield of the National Institute on Drug Abuse ranked marijuana below nicotine when it comes to withdrawal, dependence, tolerance and intoxication. Both Benowitz and Henningfield, in their rankings, determined that users get hooked on alcohol and tobacco faster than marijuana, and that, when it comes to quitting, marijuana is far easier to put down than either a cigarette or a bottle. The ruling: U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., posts a ""drug fact"" on his official website asserting that ""marijuana is less addictive than both alcohol and tobacco."" Though Blumenauer’s office provided no sourcing for the claim, the congressman’s website provides links to a number of studies. A Harvard Medical School psychiatrist agreed that of the three, alcohol is the most addictive in terms of withdrawal. He and other experts we contacted also agreed that alcohol and tobacco are more difficult to give up than marijuana, and said it’s easier to become dependent on alcohol and tobacco in the first place",True,"June 4, 2014"
"""Less than 5 percent of registered users in states allowing medical marijuana have cancer or AIDS.""","One of the biggest question marks over Florida’s proposed medical marijuana amendment is over who will use it. According to an opposition group, it’s not who you may think. Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot, a campaign run by a coalition of more than 40 organizations opposing Amendment 2, says on its website that most patients don’t suffer from the life-threatening diseases often associated with medical marijuana use. ""Less than 5 percent of registered users in states allowing medical marijuana have cancer or AIDS,"" it says. The site ramped up earlier in May, and is run by St. Petersburg lobbyist group Save Our Society From Drugs. They use information from the Florida Sheriffs Association. Cancer and AIDS are often cited by proponents of medical marijuana as the diseases that marijuana can help. We were curious to know if it’s true that only 5 percent of patients who use the drug have those two diseases. Let’s check the registries and find out. Playing percentages Florida’s Amendment 2 specifically names cancer, AIDS, glaucoma, hepatitis C, ALS, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis as eligible for treatment. It also allows for ""other conditions for which a physician believes that medical use of marijuana would likely outweigh the potential health risks for a patient."" That provides doctors plenty of latitude to make recommendations for things not on the list, like chronic pain or muscle spasms. Marijuana is typically recommended to cancer patients to treat nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy treatments. AIDS patients often use it to treat nausea, pain and loss of appetite. The big problem with tracking why medical marijuana patients use the drug is that the rules and record-keeping vary widely among the 21 states that allow it. Eric Pounders, spokesman for the Florida Sheriffs Association, said the 5 percent figure comes from an average Save Our Society From Drugs calculated from data from 15 states, which all report things in different ways. For example, statistics from Rhode Island say 4 percent of users there have cancer, and 1 percent have HIV/AIDS. New Jersey says 2.3 percent use marijuana for a terminal illness. Vermont allows conditions to remain confidential. Washington has no database of users or their conditions. California has no mandatory patient registration. The Marijuana Policy Project, a national group that tracks state regulations and favors the Florida amendment, says only six states routinely update comprehensive user data, so Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot’s list of 15 states is suspect. Karen O’Keefe, the project’s director of state policies, says a state like Alaska (which Pounders cited) doesn’t keep very accurate records on patients at all. At any rate, the numbers reflect a trend among the states that report conditions: A very small number of medical marijuana patients have cancer or AIDS. Opponents think that’s a big problem. ""We want to show Floridians that the disease groups they are constantly hearing about, are not the ones that marijuana is primarily treating,"" Pounders said. He said pro-marijuana groups often use those two diseases to appeal to people’s sympathies. Dr. Gary Reisfield, from the University of Florida’s psychiatry department, agreed. While he said the 5 percent was comparable to research he’d seen, the outsized use of the two diseases as an example was a smokescreen by advocates. ""Cancer and HIV are the camel's nose under the tent,"" he told PolitiFact Florida. ""Physicians, most of whom favor medical cannabis legislation, will acquiesce to their patients' demands for cannabis for other ‘debilitating conditions,’ like pain, muscle spasm, headaches, insomnia and anxiety."" Those are the kinds of conditions for which most patients are treated, said Dr. Barth Wilsey of the University of California Davis Medical Center. He pointed to a University of Michigan study last year that found 87 percent of sample patients from a Michigan clinic sought medical marijuana for pain relief, either on its own or in conjunction with other conditions. Cancer was cited as 3.4 percent of the sample and people with AIDS were combined with hepatitis C under ""chronic infection,"" and totaled 2.3 percent. Wilsey added that doesn’t mean there’s something wrong with patients wanting to relieve pain, especially because most medical marijuana patients turn to the drug only after exhausting other options. He said he thought Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot was ""trivializing"" patients suffering from very real medical issues. ""The significance of this statement is tempered by the fact that millions of Americans suffer from chronic pain. One type, neuropathic pain, is particularly difficult to treat,"" Wilsey said. ""One thing is certain, we need more research on medical marijuana and less decision-making by legislatures and referendums."" Our ruling Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot said ""less than 5 percent of registered users in states allowing medical marijuana have cancer or AIDS."" The medical marijuana opponents that run the website said they estimated their total using figures from states with current laws allowing the drug. Not all states report figures the same way, however, or may not report them at all. Patients who don’t have cancer or AIDS still may have legitimate reasons to use medical marijuana, including for pain relief. So the statistic Don't Let Florida Go to Pot cites isn't perfect. But the available evidence does suggest fairly strongly that the people who use medical marijuana for cancer or AIDS is a small percentage of all users",Mostly True,"May 29, 2014"

The sheriffs association’s tax status prevents it from actively lobbying for people to vote against Amendment 2, but the group publicly opposes the measure. The sheriff’s association and Save Our Society did not answer our questions about why they think teens will be free to roll up spliffs without asking mom and dad first. Others have complained the measure’s language doesn’t set a minimum age, and therefore targets minors. But the vague amendment language is by design, according to the organization behind the amendment. United for Care attorney Jon Mills told PolitiFact Florida that by not addressing the age issue, a topic that was discussed while drafting the proposal, the amendment allows state law to take precedent on the issue of age. Currently, a parent or guardian must provide consent for medical treatment for a minor, except in emergencies or other unusual circumstances, such as when the Department of Children and Family Services must get involved. The absence of an age limit is to allow the state freedom to write the rules as they see fit, should the amendment pass and become part of the state Constitution.    ""If we put a minimum age in we’d never be able to modify it,"" Mills said, referring to how the amendment will change the state’s Constitution, rather than creating a new statute, as many medical marijuana states do. There are 21 states with laws that allow medical cannabis. Only three (California, Washington and Massachusetts) make no mention of minors in their language, as in the Florida amendment. Karen O’Keefe, director of state policies for the Marijuana Policy Project, which favors measures to allow medical marijuana, said all three still require parental involvement in some way. Minnesota, which will soon be the 22nd state to allow it, also doesn’t include language about children. Three other states (Connecticut, Delaware and Illinois) specifically exclude allowing minors to use the drug -- and Illinois is on the brink of changing its law concerning kids. The other 15 allow children access to the drug to some degree but only with parental consent. ""In Florida, I think there is no way that minors will actually ultimately be allowed to sign up for medical marijuana without their parent or guardian’s support. In fact, the rules may be even more strict than they are in most states,"" O’Keefe said. She compared Amendment 2 to Massachusetts’ 2012 law, which didn’t mention minors. The state ended up heavily regulating use by children. Vanderbilt Law School professor Robert Mikos pointed out that any teenager would have to go through the same vetting process as adults. That means they would undergo whatever examination, registration and regulation process the state creates. ""Does this mean a 13-year-old could just go in and get a certification? That’s not the case in any state,"" he said. ""There’s nothing about the Florida proposal that says Florida would be worse than any other state."" So if concerns about minors are unfounded, could Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot potentially mean 18- or 19-year-olds? They’re technically teenagers. Mikos says if that’s what Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot is saying, ""it’s a very misleading statement meant to scare people."" He points out that 18-year-olds are allowed to buy tobacco and are allowed prescriptions to Oxycontin, so marijuana probably shouldn’t be treated any differently. Douglas Berman, an Ohio State University law professor who edits a marijuana policy blog, says the opposition’s concern about teen use could possibly be better illustrated by the possibility of those older teens exploiting the system. ""There’s nothing in this to stop college kids on spring break to go into the doctor’s office and saying, ‘My back hurts,’ and getting some, not for medicinal purposes, but because they want to have fun,"" Berman said. But focusing on that angle in medical legislation is a dubious argument. ""There’s nothing else in medicine that we go to a 19-year-old and say, ‘Hey, you need your parents’ permission,"" Berman added. Our ruling Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot says ""the amendment allows a teenager to get a recommendation for medical marijuana without the consent of a parent."" The group didn’t offer us any specifics on what it meant. The amendment is actually silent on the issue of minors. The proposal’s framers say they specifically didn’t include minors in its language in order to let state law reign supreme. Policy experts said state regulations usually dictate parental consent is necessary, and there’s no reason to think Florida would be any different. We should note that in all probability, 18- and 19-year-olds would have access like any other adult",Half True,"May 22, 2014"
"""Today’s marijuana is 300 percent to 800 percent more potent than the pot of yesteryear.""","Editors note: This item was revised on April 1, 2014 to reflect the fact that increases of 300 and 800 percent represent four- and nine-fold increases respectively. The ruling remains the same. In the debate over whether marijuana should be legalized, one issue is the question of potency. Critics of legalization argue that the street drug now available for sale is not the marijuana that a lot of baby boomers and Generation Xers have used. One of them, Heidi Heilman, director of New England field development for Smart Approaches to Marijuana and president of the Massachusetts Prevention Alliance, raised the issue March 13 in a commentary in The Providence Journal. ""Today’s marijuana is 300 percent to 800 percent more potent than the pot of yesteryear,"" she wrote. ""Such dangerous levels of THC heighten mental illness and addiction risks for those who smoke marijuana — especially for kids with developing brains."" THC or tetrahydrocannabinol, available by prescription, is the key active ingredient in marijuana. It's well established that the potency of marijuana has increased over time. On Jan. 24, PolitiFact national ruled that when former Rhode Island Congressman Patrick Kennedy said that marijuana today is ""genetically modified,"" with THC levels that ""far surpass the marijuana"" of the 1970s, his statement was Mostly True. Heilman was being more specific. Because something 100 percent more potent is actually twice as potent, she was saying that the potency of today's marijuana is now four to nine times greater than ""yesteryear,"" a rather vague starting point. Nonetheless, we wanted to see if her statement was on target or her statistic was a bit high. Heilman was quick to send us several pieces of information. The first was a graph showing a rapid increase in potency from 1960 to 2011, a 52-year span. It shows the ratio of THC in marijuana going from 0.2 percent to 11.4 percent. That's an increase of 5,700 percent, well outside the range cited by Heilman. But are those numbers reliable? The graph says the information came from a study in the Journal of Forensic Science. But that study was published in 2010, and only covered a 16-year period that ends in 2008. Its authors, researchers at the National Center for Natural Products Research at the University of Mississippi, examined 46,000 samples of marijuana seized during law enforcement raids. They found that the THC concentrations of marijuana had risen by about 171 percent in that time period, well below the 300 to 800 percent increase cited by Heilman. We also contacted the Drug Enforcement Administration in Boston and Washington and the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. They referred us back to the research center at Ole Miss, which has been monitoring THC content at least since the early 1970s. The researchers there sent us copies of their reports, all published in the journal, along with test results that included the most recent data. We also secured some of their quarterly reports. We found that even though the report Heilman cited didn’t back up her claim, the Ole Miss data did.

That would be 300 percent higher (or four times stronger) than 1992 levels, when the average was 3.08 percent. And it would be 800 percent higher (or nine times stronger) than the average level of 0.98 percent found in 1976. How high could the THC content potentially go? One specimen, seized on Sept. 11, 2007, was found to have a THC content of 37.2 percent. Our ruling  Heidi Heilman said, ""Today’s marijuana is 300 percent to 800 percent more potent than the pot of yesteryear."" Long-term testing shows that, on average, today's marijuana is three times more potent than pre-1993 marijuana and eight times more potent than grass seized in 1976 and earlier",True,"March 30, 2014"
"In the U.S., ""African-Americans continue to be arrested at nearly three and one half times the rate of whites"" on marijuana charges.","While there’s a growing debate over whether to legalize marijuana, some are troubled by what they see as unfairness in enforcement of existing laws. Among them is the New England Area Conference of the NAACP. The organization released a statement March 3 in support of a Rhode Island House bill that would legalize using marijuana or possessing up to an ounce. Currently, possession of an ounce or less of marijuana is a civil offense, punishable by a $150 fine. Among their reasons for supporting that change, the statement said, was that in the United States, African-Americans were 3.7 times more likely than whites to get arrested on marijuana charges, based on the number of arrests and their share of the nation’s population. James Vincent, president of the Providence NAACP, said the claim was based on a June 2013 report by the American Civil Liberties Union, ""The War on Marijuana in Black and White."" That report charted how many blacks and whites were arrested for marijuana possession and then, based on the racial population of each state, what the marijuana arrest rate per 100,000 people was for each race. The ACLU report used statistics compiled by the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting Program, a wide-ranging database of annual crime statistics that are often used in national crime studies because each state submits the same type of information, which allows apples-to-apples comparisons. Nationally, according to the report, the marijuana arrest rate for African-Americans in 2010 was 716 per 100,000, while for whites it was 192 per 100,000, meaning African-Americans were 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession. The disparities were present across the country; in some states, the arrest rate for African-Americans was as much as 8.3 times the white rate. In Rhode Island, before possession of small amounts of marijuana was decriminalized, the arrest rate for African-Americans was 524 per 100,000, while the rate for whites was 201 per 100,000. That meant African-Americans were 2.6 times more likely to be arrested on marijuana charges than their white fellow citizens. That Rhode Island disparity was specifically cited in the bill text as a proposed ""legislative finding"" justifying enactment of the legislation. The authors of the ACLU report cautioned the FBI data wasn’t perfect. They noted that the FBI didn’t count Latinos as a separate group, usually putting them in the ‘‘white’’ classification. That has the effect of preventing an accurate measurement of Latino arrests and inflating the number of white arrests, the report said. The authors said more research could be done to explore how other factors, such as past criminal records, age of the persons arrested or the population density of the location of the arrest might affect the arrest rates. The authors said they weren’t trying to prove or disprove a particular theory on why the disparities they found existed, just that the disparities were there. And they aren’t the first to study the issue. In 2009, Human Rights Watch, based in Washington, D.C., did a similar study, ""Decades of Disparity, Drug Arrests and Race in the United States."" While the ACLU study focused on marijuana possession arrests, the Human Rights Watch looked at all drug arrests by race from 1980 to 2007. Like the ACLU, Human Rights Watch used the FBI statistics and found arrest rates for blacks were multiple times higher than whites. In the last year it analyzed, 2007, it found African-Americans were 3.6 times more likely to be arrested on a drug charge, close to the ACLU’s 3.7 multiple for marijuana arrests in 2010. Our ruling The NAACP New England Area Conference said ""African-Americans continue to be arrested at nearly three and one half times the rate of whites"" on marijuana charges. The group accurately cited a nationwide study that used a widely accepted data source, and a similar study done a few years earlier found almost the same disparity",True,"March 16, 2014"
"Says Cathy Jordan was ""arrested"" and dragged out of her home by ""a SWAT team of hooligans"" for using medical marijuana.","Outspoken Orlando attorney John Morgan doesn’t mince words when it comes to his support of Florida’s proposed medical marijuana amendment. He does tend to paint his cause in broad strokes, however. During a University of Tampa debate on medicinal use of the drug on Feb. 24, Morgan argued that it’s misguided to enforce marijuana laws, using the example of Cathy Jordan, a 64-year-old Parrish resident who smokes to combat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. ""The issue for this year is very simple,"" Morgan said. ""Should about 350,000 to 400,000 people, including Cathy Jordan, who’s here tonight, who was arrested last year, drug out of her home, because she suffers from ALS, and marijuana is the only thing that will help her, the only question this year for us is the legalization of medical marijuana."" Later, he added this: ""There was an arrest of Cathy Jordan a year ago. An ALS patient who’s sitting right here ... this afternoon, and guess what? The agricultural commissioner sent a SWAT team of hooligans out to her house to drag her and her husband out because it's the only relief that she could get."" Jordan is now the president of the Florida Cannabis Action Network, while Morgan has spent $4 million of his own money on a petition drive for a constitutional amendment for marijuana. Some of the details Morgan mentioned about Jordan’s encounter with law enforcement, though, didn’t sound right, so we decided to check it out. Acting on a tip The Tampa Bay Times wrote about Jordan’s plight last year, confirming that her marijuana usage did in fact attract the attention of Manatee County sheriff’s deputies on Feb. 25, 2013. A Realtor noticed an extension cord running from a shed on Jordan’s property to an empty home’s garage next door, then saw a mature marijuana plant growing in Jordan’s garden. The Realtor called the authorities. According to an incident report, two deputies responded to the call, originally for burglary and theft of service for the extension cord, and confirmed the plant was there. The responding deputies’ reports noted that two men harassed them and recorded their arrival and subsequent investigation. One of the men (neither are named in those reports, although Robert Jordan and his son were home) reportedly bumped one of the deputies several times and attempted to prevent the pair of officers from entering their property, saying the marijuana was theirs and they wanted the deputies to leave. One deputy called his sergeant, who responded and then requested the department’s Special Investigations Division, an undercover vice and narcotics unit that responds to drug calls. Three detectives responded to the call and spoke to Robert Jordan, who let the police enter his house and explained his wife used marijuana to deal with her ALS symptoms, according to the division’s report. Police confirmed no marijuana being grown inside the house, then went outside to find three large plants in a plastic container and two smaller plants in another. Robert Jordan then opened the shed that used the extension cord to reveal 18 smaller seedlings, ""a lighting system, an air conditioner, a thermometer and a white erase board to track planting dates."" The authorities explained to Robert Jordan that growing marijuana was illegal under federal law and they could either take all the marijuana ""observed in plain view"" or they would go get a warrant and forcibly remove the plants. The report states neither he nor his wife were ever threatened with arrest, but reluctantly agreed to let the department confiscate 23 plants. No one was arrested or dragged out of their house by a SWAT team. The Jordans sued the Sheriff’s Office for the return of their plants last year. Sheriff’s Office public information officer Dave Bristow did verify that none of the officers responding drew their guns and only entered the Jordans’ property with permission. No warrants were necessary. The Manatee County Sheriff’s Office wouldn’t comment on the incident other than to confirm details in the report, citing pending civil litigation. Robert Jordan confirmed the incident happened the way the sheriff’s reports says it did, although he said the deputies who first arrived did rush up his driveway with their hands on their sidearms. He described them as ""very, very aggressive,"" although he said he was aggressive, too, arguing about whether probable cause allowed them on his property. He noted he told his wife to go across the street with friends after the deputies arrived, and no one touched her. He had a different opinion about the Special Investigations Division detectives. ""The actual narcotics officers, they were gentlemen,"" Jordan said. ""They were embarrassed, because I told them they were taking my wife’s medicine."" Two of the trio wore ski masks, Jordan said, which the Sheriff’s Office said is procedure to conceal their identities for undercover work. The unmasked detective told Jordan he had two choices: They could wait outside a couple of hours while they got a warrant. Jordan said the detective told him they would then come back and ""tear your house apart. And we don’t put nothing back."" Or the Jordans could walk them through the house and allow the unit to confiscate his plants, then wait for word on official charges. The officer then told Jordan they had a right to take anything in the shed, but opted to only remove the light bulb from the grow lamp and smash it. The same week, State Sen. Jeff Clemens, D-Lake Worth, introduced a medical marijuana bill called the Cathy Jordan Medical Cannabis Act. The bill died, but he filed another bill under the same name in February, ostensibly to set a framework should the amendment pass in November. Robert Jordan was in the process of buying the property next door, and the utilities were in his name, so the burglary and theft of service charges were never brought, and the Realtor’s company declined to press any trespassing charges. The Manatee County state attorney’s later reviewed the case and declined to press growing and possession charges because ""the state lacks a good-faith belief it can overcome a medical necessity defense in this matter,"" according to the office’s report. Robert Jordan could have faced a felony count of possession and manufacturing of a Schedule I drug. We asked the United for Care campaign for a response. Manager Ben Pollara said Morgan’s comments were off the cuff. ""I think it’s just a case of something that happened a year ago … and he was talking from memory,"" Pollara said. A story about officers in ski masks with guns probably made it sound like a SWAT team, he said. Robert Jordan said he figured Morgan may have gotten his account from any of the numerous outlets that layered on the hyperbole about machine guns and police brutality -- he named this story by the Huffington Post as being particularly loose with the facts. ""No one asked me, or I would have told them the truth,"" Jordan said. He also said he had only met John Morgan and didn’t know him, but liked the man for his devotion to getting medical marijuana legislation passed, and how Morgan treated his wife. Having a legal supply of cannabis available would certainly make his life easier, he added. Meanwhile, the Jordans continue to cultivate their own plants, thanks to having the charges dropped. The ruling Morgan said ""a SWAT team of hooligans"" dragged Cathy Jordan out of her home and arrested her after authorities discovered her family’s tiny growing operation in their Parrish backyard. Officers obtained consent to search the property and removed mature plants and seedlings, and Robert Jordan faced charges of growing and possessing marijuana, which were later dropped. No one was arrested. No one was dragged anywhere. It seems Morgan may have read a report of the incident awash in hyperbole and recalled that. There was an incident at the Jordans’ home, but the police reaction was not nearly as drastic as Morgan described",Mostly False,"March 13, 2014"
Every child in Colorado who has been given medical marijuana for treatment for seizures has had diminished seizure activity.,"An important debate is ongoing in the Georgia Legislature concerning the use of a form of medical marijuana to treat certain forms of seizures. The state’s House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed House Bill 885, which would allow for the use of medical research cannabis in specific cases. The bill’s supporters are anxiously hoping the Georgia Senate will adopt the legislation. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s new Legislative Navigator gives it a 27 percent chance of passing this session. The bill’s primary sponsor, Rep. Allen Peake, R-Macon, offered what appeared to be a persuasive argument to support the legislation. ""(In Colorado), 100 percent of children have seen diminished seizure activity,"" Peake told fellow House members in the discussion before the bill was passed. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether Peake’s statement was correct. Peake and other leading House Republicans did not plan to advocate this session on legislation that involves medical marijuana, particularly in an election year. Peake said he was persuaded to get involved after meeting a 4-year-old girl from his area named Haleigh Cox who suffers from a severe seizure disorder. Peake said he received the information he used to base his claim from the Realm of Caring, a Colorado-based organization that has attempted to provide care to patients suffering from cancer, AIDS, Parkinson’s disease and other conditions through the use of medicinal cannabis oil. Some Georgians have moved to Colorado to seek treatment for their children. Peake clarified his statement, saying that it was actually 98 percent of patients who had diminished seizure activity. Marijuana contains about 60 chemical components called cannabinoids. The cannabinoid that the bill’s proponents are considering is cannabidiol. It would be ingested and not smoked, the bill’s supporters say. It would not include THC, which is the element in cannabis that causes smokers to get high. The form of cannabidiol used at the Realm of Caring is named Charlotte’s Web, after a 5-year-old girl whose recovery from a rare condition is credited to the substance. Charlotte’s Web is a rich amber and as thick as cold honey. It smells like marijuana and tastes like raw plants. A month’s supply of the oil can cost $150 to $250, and some families say they receive financial help from nonprofit groups. Heather Jackson, the executive director of the Realm of Caring Foundation, said Peake was correct that every patient studied in the first set of tests, ""harvests"" is the term she used, had a reduction in seizures. The Realm of Caring is in its second harvest and has seen less than a handful of nonresponders, which accounts for Peake’s revised 98 percent total. The New York Times, though, reported in December that there is ""scattered medical research"" to substantiate claims cannabis oils helped reduce seizures, citing a 2012 study on the American Epilepsy Society’s website. Other researchers have also cautioned there is not enough research on its medicinal benefits. The American Epilepsy Society wants ""well-controlled studies"" it believes will lead to a better understanding of the effectiveness of cannabidiol and other forms of medical marijuana on epilepsy patients. Amy Brooks-Kayal, a Colorado-based neurology physician who is first vice president of the American Epilepsy Society, said there’s not enough information to determine what the dosage should be or how it interacts with other medicines. The AES, which claims about 3,500 members, said although cannabidiol offers hope, these are only anecdotal reports. Robust scientific evidence for the use of marijuana, it said, is lacking. ""There haven’t been good studies with cannabidiol with children with epilepsy,"" Brooks-Kayal said. The federal Food and Drug Administration has authorized trials of an established British drug, Epidolex, that comes from marijuana. Some experts who believe Epidolex is a better option say it’s unclear whether Charlotte’s Web is free of potentially harmful impurities. Jackson offered us two studies in defense of the treatment. In one study, all 11 children studied showed a reduction in weekly motor-type seizures, the study concluded. After three months, five of the 11 children were seizure-free, the study found. The paper, introduced at the American Epilepsy Society’s annual meeting in December, acknowledged the sample size was small. In the other study, two Stanford University researchers asked parents whose children were using cannabidiol to fill out a survey detailing its impact on their children. Sixteen of the 19 parents reported reduced seizure frequency. Three parents said their children were free of seizures. The most often reported side effects were better mood, increased alertness, better sleep and drowsiness. Common side effects with other forms of treatment were not found, the parents said. Jackson said 13 of those 19 parents had children who were using Charlotte’s Web. Jackson said they are doing more research. Jackson, whose son has used the treatment, said in the cases in which Charlotte’s Web did not result in fewer seizures for the patient, ""there is less than a 1 percent chance that a child in this intractable epilepsy population will find one that will work."" Charlotte’s Web, she said, has performed better than other forms of treatment. ""There is not a treatment in the world that will work for all,"" Jackson told us. ""However, it is important to note that there is not a pharmaceutical in the world that works for even 5 percent of the epilepsy population. So the numbers are quite staggering actually."" Peake said he was not deterred by questions or concerns about the research. ""The anecdotal evidence is so strong that a parent, in conjunction with their doctor, should have the personal choice to make that decision,"" Peake said. To sum up, Peake said ""every child in Colorado"" who has been given medical marijuana for treatment for seizures has had diminished seizure activity. Peake then said it’s actually 98 percent, citing newer data. There are very few studies out there. They do show medical marijuana has a positive impact on seizure activity. But not at the levels Peake said. His statement is partially accurate. But it needs a lot of context to be fully understood",Half True,"March 11, 2014"
"The medical marijuana ballot initiative ""doesn’t require a physician writing a prescription"" and can be for conditions like ""having a back that needs to be scratched.""","As medical marijuana heads to the ballot in Florida in November, opponents like Senate President Don Gaetz have argued that it will be too easy for people who want to smoke pot recreationally to get their hands on it. ""The ballot initiative is the legalization of marijuana,"" said Gaetz in an interview on Florida Face to Face on Feb. 13, 2014. ""It doesn’t require a physician writing a prescription and it can be for purposes as specious as having a back that needs to be scratched. That’s the legalization of marijuana that I oppose and will vote against in November."" We’ve already fact-checked claims about the initiative, and there’s some merit to the argument that people will be able to get medical marijuana for a wide variety of conditions. But Gaetz’s claim about physicians struck us as suspicious, so we decided to check it out.   Would patients need a prescription? In a 4-3 ruling in late January, the Florida Supreme Court paved the way for the amendment about medical marijuana to appear on the November ballot. The ballot summary mentions doctors right off the bat: ""Allows the medical use of marijuana for individuals with debilitating diseases as determined by a licensed Florida physician. Allows caregivers to assist patients’ medical use of marijuana. The Department of Health shall register and regulate centers that produce and distribute marijuana for medical purposes and shall issue identification cards to patients and caregivers. Applies only to Florida law. Does not authorize violations of federal law or any non-medical use, possession or production of marijuana."" But if you read further into the amendment text, you’ll see that technically patients wouldn’t get a ""prescription."" Instead, patients will need a ""physician certification,"" which the amendment text states means ""a written document signed by a physician, stating that in the physician‘s professional opinion, the patient suffers from a debilitating medical condition, that the potential benefits of the medical use of marijuana would likely outweigh the health risks for the patient, and for how long the physician recommends the medical use of marijuana for the patient. A physician certification may only be provided after the physician has conducted a physical examination of the patient and a full assessment of the patient‘s medical history."" Robert Mikos, a Vanderbilt law school professor who specializes in drug policy, told PolitiFact Florida that there is a fine distinction between a certification (or a recommendation, as it’s commonly called in other medical marijuana states) and a prescription. Doctors generally don’t ""prescribe"" marijuana, because in order for a physician to be allowed to prescribe narcotics, the doctor must register with the Drug Enforcement Agency. If the practitioner were to prescribe a Schedule I drug like marijuana -- which means under federal guidelines it is a dangerous narcotic, with no approved medical uses -- they would lose their registration, and would legally no longer be allowed to prescribe drugs. On the other hand, a 2002 federal court decision did find that a doctor could simply recommend the drug, protecting the discussion with their patient under First Amendment protections of freedom of speech. ""In the legally relevant sense, it’s no different than a doctor recommending jogging every day,"" Mikos said. The certification in practice would largely be a piece of paper documenting the discussion, and would create a paper trail similar to a prescription, in order to track who is getting the drug and why. Once a patient gets that certification, the Department of Health will issue the patient an identification card, according to the ballot language. Under the Florida law, patients would not be able to grow their own plants. Approved patients could purchase marijuana from registered, state-regulated centers. If the amendment passes, the Department of Health will set rules for how centers will operate. What sort of conditions would be covered? The amendment text lists a number of qualifying conditions for medical marijuana, including cancer, glaucoma, HIV/AIDs, Hepatitis C, ALS, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis. But as Gaetz’s spokeswoman Katie Betta noted, it also includes this language: ""or other conditions for which a physician believes that the medical use of marijuana would likely outweigh the potential health risks for a patient."" The Supreme Court, in allowing the amendment to go forward, noted that conditions that qualified would be those that ""cause impaired strength, weakness or enfeeblement."" We’ve previously noted that the ballot language suggests marijuana could be recommended for conditions like muscle spasms, neck pain, back pain and menstrual cramps, because all those conditions could be described as ""debilitating."" This means anyone who has a condition that weakens or enfeebles them could qualify to use marijuana if their physician indicated that their use of marijuana outweighed the potential health risks. That would include a wide range of ailments, and Gaetz’s spokesperson defended his choice of words on those grounds. ""The president is making the point that the amendment is open-ended because it states that a physician can issue a certification allowing for the use of medical marijuana for any condition where the benefit could outweigh the risks. ..."" Betta told PolitiFact in an email. ""The Supreme Court’s ruling did not interpret the amendment for application and will not be bound by any interpretation that was advanced related to the ballot summary challenge."" Still, Gaetz seems to be going too far using an example of ""a back that needs to be scratched."" Certainly, chronic itching can be a serious condition, but Gaetz's implication is that a condition with a simple remedy could be used to qualify for marijuana. The ballot language sets a higher bar than that, noting that the condition must be ""debilitating."" Our ruling Gaetz said the medical marijuana ballot initiative ""doesn’t require a physician writing a prescription, and it can be for purposes as specious as a back that needs to be scratched."" Because of federal law, doctors won’t be writing prescriptions. Instead they will write a certification after examining the patient, determining the patient would benefit from marijuana and how long the patient should use it. Gaetz’s statement suggests Floridians could get marijuana without a doctor being involved, but that’s not the case. Gaetz’s claim that someone can get marijuana for having a back in need of scratching is also misleading. The ballot language says that a condition must be debilitating, which means it weakens the person. While many different types of conditions could qualify under this definition, a back that simply needed scratching wouldn't qualify",Half True,"February 21, 2014"
"Marijuana today is ""genetically modified,"" with THC levels that ""far surpass the marijuana"" of the 1970s.","Apparently, back when President Barack Obama would get high with the Choom Gang, he was tokin’ on some weak product by today’s standards. At least, that’s what one former congressman says. After Obama told The New Yorker that marijuana is no more dangerous than alcohol — which opened the door to a broader conversation about legalizing or decriminalizing a drug that’s on the federal government’s most restrictive list, Schedule I — former Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., said the president needs to brush up on his pot knowledge. ""I think the president needs to speak to his (National Institute of Health) director in charge of drug abuse,"" said Kennedy, who chairs Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a group that opposes legalization. The NIH director ""would tell the president that, in fact, today’s modern, genetically modified marijuana (has) much higher THC levels, far surpass(ing) the marijuana that the president acknowledges smoking when he was a young person."" Obama’s exploits as a pot-smoking adolescent are well documented in his own memoir, Dreams from My Father. More recently, in journalist David Maraniss’ biography Barack Obama: The Story, readers learned that Obama as a high schooler in the late 1970s rolled with a group called the Choom Gang — friends from Hawaii who frequently got high. But has marijuana changed that much? We decided to investigate. What is THC? Cannabis contains roughly 500 compounds, 70 of which are psychoactive. THC, or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, is the main psychoactive ingredient in the marijuana plant. The level of THC in a plant varies based on the strain. When researchers discuss the potency of marijuana, they typically are measuring the concentration of THC. THC levels also differ depending on the part of the plant used, and how it is processed for consumption. In addition to marijuana, there are materials such as sinsemilla (the flowering tops of unfertilized female plants), hashish or cannabis resin, and hash oil (a concentrated extract from cannabis plants). Hashish oil tends to have much higher concentrations of THC than marijuana or even sinsemilla. Both of these have become more popular in recent years. But what about marijuana itself? Has weed as we once knew it become more potent? The answer is: yes. THC levels are on the rise, and they have been for quite some time. The University of Mississippi Potency Monitoring project analyzed tens of thousands of marijuana samples confiscated by state and federal law enforcement agencies since 1972. The average potency of all seized cannabis has increased from a concentration of 3.4 percent in 1993 to about 8.8 percent in 2008. Potency in sinsemilla in particular has jumped from 5.8 percent to 13.4 percent during that same time period. Back in the late 1970s when Obama was in high school (he graduated in 1979), the mean potency for marijuana was about 3 percent, said Mahmoud ElSohly, director of marijuana research at Ole Miss. Further, the number of samples confiscated with a THC concentration greater than 9 percent has increased significantly, from 3.2 percent in 1993 to 21.5 percent of the 1,635 marijuana samples collected in 2007. But while the average is up due to the availability of marijuana with a higher THC count, the high mark in potency (somewhere around 25-27 percent) remains relatively unchanged in the last couple decades and isn’t likely to increase, ElSohly said. How did it get so strong? The former congressman said the reason for the increasing levels of THC is genetic modification. That’s not quite right. Genetic modification or genetic engineering involves altering a substance’s DNA at the molecular level. Producers of marijuana on the illicit market don’t have the ability to pull off those kinds of lab-based modifications. However, genetic selection involves breeding marijuana plants with the highest concentration of THC. Genetic selection, unlike genetic modification, has been practiced for centuries. Think about how we got different breeds of dogs or varieties of tomatoes. Genetic selection is quite prevalent in marijuana, ElSohly said. Drug dealers have steered toward these methods in hopes of creating a product that enables them to sell smaller volume at a higher cost. Cultivation methods that allow growers to control climate, water and soil levels have dramatically improved production as well, he said, and they have a better idea what parts of the plant produce the highest concentration of THC. There is some genetic engineering of marijuana in labs, but it’s not widespread yet and it’s not the cause for the increase, ElSohly said. What does it mean? What does this rise in potency mean in a practical sense? Let’s start with what the National Institutes of Health says, since Kennedy singled out the government agency. Noting that the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana has increased in recent decades, the NIH warns that ""daily use can have stronger effects on a developing teen brain than it did 10 or 20 years ago."" Researchers have warned against marijuana use by teens and even young adults, noting that developing brains have an increased risk of dependency. That was an issue even before potency factored in, though the growing strength of the drug does have health officials more concerned. Those concerns are also directed at populations who had already been advised against smoking marijuana when THC levels were lower, such as individuals with cardiovascular diseases or those with certain mental illness, such as schizophrenia. But for the average adult recreational or habitual user, there’s a lot less certainty about what rising THC levels mean. Only a handful of studies have looked at how users smoke marijuana with varying THC levels. Several of these studies noted that when test subjects were using more highly concentrated marijuana, they often smoked less than they did when consuming product with a lower THC level. In that regard, THC would seem to mimic how people consume beverages with different alcohol content: People tend to drink whiskey in shots, wine by the glass and beer by the mug. Marijuana may work the same way, said Carl Hart, a psychology professor at Columbia University who studies the effects of psychoactive drugs. Roger Roffman, a social work professor at the University of Washington and author of the upcoming book Marijuana Nation, noted that there has been little research on the impact of potency in cannabis at the levels seen today, especially in products like hash oil, meaning we don’t know everything about its potential impact. Beyond dependency, health officials also warn that smoking marijuana can cause paranoia and in some cases anxiety attacks. Hospital visits caused by marijuana are on the rise over the last decade, from 359,795 in 2004 to 540,340 in 2011. However, it is unclear if that is caused by higher potency levels, greater usage of marijuana or other factors. This is all important food for thought, because the debate is ongoing and more research is needed. However, this didn't affect our ruling. Our ruling Kennedy said that marijuana today is ""genetically modified,"" with THC levels that ""far surpass the marijuana"" of the 1970s. Generally speaking, the potency of marijuana has been on the rise since Obama’s youth, though experts disagree about what impact that rise could have on marijuana’s negative health effects, in part because the research so far has been incomplete. The most off-base part of Kennedy’s claim is that the rise in THC levels comes from ""genetic modification."" It’s actually from genetic selection, a very old process of producing desired traits from crops",Mostly True,"January 24, 2014"
Says Colorado food stamp recipients can use ATMs to get cash to buy marijuana.,"We are a scant few weeks into the era of legal recreational pot in Colorado and so far, there are no reports of increased driving accidents or violence. But Fox News found a different point of concern. Brian Kilmeade, co-host of Fox and Friends, honed in on the connection between pot and food stamps, otherwise known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. ""Can people collecting food stamps in Colorado add marijuana to their shopping list?"" Kilmeade asked. ""Right now, the answer is yes. Because there’s nothing blocking using government benefit cards in pot shop ATMs."" In this fact-check, we are looking specifically at Kilmeade’s claim that people receiving food stamps in Colorado can use an ATM to get cash that they can use in turn to purchase marijuana. We reached out to Fox News and got no response. Federal and Colorado law says that food stamps must be used for food (hat tip here to Media Matters). The U.S. Department of Agriculture says ""SNAP benefits can never be withdrawn as cash."" So if SNAP benefits can’t be withdrawn as cash, how can people use them at Colorado pot shops? They can’t. Colorado gives SNAP recipients a Quest Card, which is basically a debit card. It’s a cover-all card used by people who sign up for SNAP, low-income energy assistance, welfare (Temporary Aid for Needy Families or TANF) or any other aid they might qualify for. People receiving benefits from those other programs can use their Quest Card at an ATM to get cash. But not SNAP, and the card knows the difference, officials with the Colorado Department of Human Services told us. ""The card is programmed to distinguish between a cash withdrawal for TANF, or any other cash benefit, and a food purchase with SNAP dollars,"" said Dan Drayer, the department’s communications director. ""There’s no way they can get SNAP benefits from a machine."" Kilmeade would have been more correct if he had focused on another federal benefit -- Temporary Assistance For Needy Families, or TANF. Nothing would prevent a person with a Quest Card with TANF money on it from using the card in any ATM to get cash, which they could then use to buy marijuana. Two final points. First, marijuana stores do have ATMs. ""Due to the lack of access to banking services for cannabis businesses, purchases generally must be done in cash,"" said Taylor West, deputy director of the National Cannabis Industry Association, a trade group. Second, a SNAP benefit card will only work with foods that are the approved by the USDA. A rumor that food stamps could be used to buy marijuana brownies falls flat because no food that can be eaten in the store, laced with pot or otherwise, would be on the government’s list. Our ruling Fox News’ Kilmeade said ATMs give food stamp recipients in Colorado a way to buy marijuana. The technology behind government electronic benefit cards blocks that. While the card could have cash value from another program such as TANF, no ATM would dispense cash based on a person’s food stamp allowance",False,"January 24, 2014"
"People on pot ""shoot each other ... stab each other ... strangle each other, drive under the influence, kill families.""","An amusing Web video pits tough-talking former prosecutor and HLN host Nancy Grace against a combative adversary on the subject of pot: Nancy Grace. In one frame, Grace argues smoking marijuana makes users less prone to picking a fight or ""basically starting Mortal Kombat."" They’re more likely ""to lay on the sofa and eat,"" she said while discussing Trayvon Martin having marijuana in his system at the time of death. In the other frame, Grace is heated up about the debate du jour: legalized recreational pot in Colorado. In a recent show, Grace dismissed the arguments of a marijuana advocate who thinks the drug should be legalized and regulated like alcohol. She argued about whether the drug is ""highly addictive"" with Marijuana Policy Project spokesman Mason Tvert, who suggested Grace is against legalization because ""she does not like the people that use marijuana."" She disagreed. ""The reason I’m against legalization of pot is that I’ve seen too many felonies, and I don’t mean pot sales or growing pot,"" she said. ""I mean people on pot that shoot each other, that stab each other, strangle each other, drive under the influence, kill families — wipe out a whole family."" Tvert went on to chastise her ""1930s"" tone, and the argument went on. For many, Grace’s comments about people using marijuana and committing violent acts raised eyebrows, so we decided to check it out. HLN publicists did not respond for comment. The consensus among drug and psychiatry experts: Marijuana alone does not propel one to commit acts of violence. Most users are not lighting up and heading over to Fight Club. They want to wind down, not amp up. And while there is evidence that people who commit crimes often smoke marijuana (in part because smoking marijuana is a crime in many places itself), there is little support to back up the idea that it drives people to commit crimes, especially violent ones like Grace described. ""Clearly the majority of users don’t become aggressive,"" said Dr. Ihsan Salloum, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and chief of the Division of Substance & Alcohol Abuse at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. ""Definitely in terms of clinical work, violence is not the first thing that comes to mind when people are dealing with marijuana."" That said, marijuana is still a mind-altering drug, and it could have a different effect on people who are predisposed to aggression and anxiety, he said. It could induce fear or paranoia when people cannot process an environment, though some may withdraw instead of reacting aggressively. Other psychologists and psychiatrists essentially agreed with Salloun. ""Other than people driving under the influence, there’s no scientific basis for what she’s saying,"" said Matthew Johnson, associate professor in the psychiatry department at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The effect is often not as dramatic as driving under the influence of alcohol, Johnson said. Usually people who drive while high drive slower, and the impairment is usually noticed when the driver’s attention is divided, he said, akin to the effect of some prescription medications. People who come to treatment facilities are typically using multiple drugs, making it tough to suss out which substance was responsible for a violent act. Violence is not typically associated with the use of marijuana, unless the victim is a ""chocolate chip cookie,"" joked Dr. Scott Teitelbaum, professor and vice chairman of the University of Florida’s Department of Psychiatry and chief of the Division of Addiction Medicine. Levity aside, Teitelbaum stressed some people can still become addicted to the drug, and he worries about more young people using it with further legalization. A spokeswoman for the St. Petersburg, Fla.-based Drug Free America Foundation directed us to a slew of news clips documenting shootings related to marijuana theft, grow houses and co-ops. The clips also highlighted marijuana use of gunmen from some of the country’s most recent and notorious shooting sprees. ""In many cases of violence, such as with Benjamin Bishop, Jared Loughner, James Holmes and the Pentagon shooter, these gunmen actively were or previously had been marijuana users,"" said Calvina Fay, the foundation’s executive director, in a statement. She pointed to a 2012 study by researchers from Duke University, the University of Oregon, King’s College London and University of Otago in New Zealand that highlighted brain development in teens who smoke marijuana. The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, relied on data for more than 1,000 people who were tracked from the time they were born to age 38. People who started using marijuana as teens and used it at least once a week showed the biggest loss in IQ points. People who picked up the drug as adults didn’t show the same loss in mental functioning. Johnson, the Johns Hopkins professor, says this research is controversial because it’s tough to eliminate marijuana use from all other factors that make people willing to engage in behavior that isn’t socially acceptable. ""But even if that were true, we’re talking about a small minority,"" he said. ""It’s not a question for the large majority of the public."" Gil Kerlikowske, the White House director of national drug-control policy, released an analysis in May that attempted to show a link between crime and marijuana use. It found that 80 percent of adult males arrested for crimes in Sacramento, Calif., in 2012 tested positive for at least one illegal drug. The most commonly detected drug was marijuana, which was found in 54 percent of those arrested. The analysis didn't say what percentage of the crimes were violent and did not conclude that marijuana was the reason people committed crimes. (A positive urine sample only indicates use in the past month.) FBI data for violent crimes with reported drug and alcohol involvement is not broken down by substance, so there is no telling which violent crimes as reported by law enforcement agencies are at least linked to marijuana use. A 2003 report by the National Bureau of Economic Research found ""surprisingly few"" studies have tried to nail down a direct link between marijuana use and crime. After reviewing related academic studies and crunching arrest and crime data, the NBER researchers determined people involved with violent crimes are also likely to use marijuana, but ""the marijuana use is not necessarily related to their decision to engage in crime."" Their report highlighted a 20-year-old study by the National Research Council that suggested longterm marijuana use may affect a person's nervous system so he or she becomes more violent. Still, the causal link ""remains in question,"" the NBER report said. The researchers did find a positive association between marijuana use and property-damage crimes, particularly among youth. Finally, on the subject of high-profile murderers who use the drug, Johnson said there is bound to be overlap between people accused of murder and those who use marijuana given how popular it is. But the same could be said for people who have blond hair and commit murders, he said. One is not a direct result of the other. Dr. Antoine Douaihy of the University of Pittsburgh College of Medicine said even though he thinks Grace is overreaching, there are concerns about the unknown social risks of legalizing marijuana in more states. Often, he said, people are passionate about the topic without noting nuances or differentiating among legalization, decriminalization and authorizing cannabis for medicinal purposes. Our ruling Grace said, people on pot ""shoot each other ... stab each other ... strangle each other, drive under the influence, kill families."" Yes, you can find individual cases to back up each of Grace's points, but Grace suggested pot drives people generally to commit violent acts, and there's no evidence of that. Behavioral science experts we consulted stressed using marijuana has consequences. But a hard turn toward violence, including shooting each other and killing families, isn’t one of the direct effects from using the drug for most people",Mostly False,"January 24, 2014"
"""In 1916, the U.S. government predicted that by the 1940s all paper would come from hemp and that no more trees would need to be cut down.""","With the recent legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado, pot is hot. So when a reader was curious about the accuracy of an Internet meme about hemp -- a close botanical cousin of marijuana that has been caught up on in the war on drugs -- they sent it our way. The graphic says: ""In 1916, the U.S. government predicted that by the 1940s all paper would come from hemp and that no more trees would need to be cut down."" The claim has proliferated all over the Internet. Sometimes a source is listed (such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture archives), but none of the repetitions ever seems to have a checkable citation, much less a direct link to a verifiable source. We decided to take a closer look. First, some background on hemp. Hemp and marijuana are both varieties of the cannabis plant, but hemp has much lower levels of THC, the psychoactive compound that makes marijuana a drug. Over the years, hemp has been used to make a wide variety of products, from rope, fabrics and paper to food and fuel, but its use in the United States dwindled after World War II. After more than a decade of dormancy as a crop in the United States, hemp was effectively outlawed by the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, which drew no distinctions between hemp and cannabis, presumably because the two plants look so similar that it would be easy to conceal illegal marijuana plants in a field of hemp. Some states have since loosened their laws about hemp cultivation, but federal law remains a steep obstacle to efforts to revive the domestic hemp industry. Because the legal fates of marijuana and hemp have been closely intertwined over the years, supporters of decriminalizing marijuana have often made common cause with those who would like to revive hemp as a crop in the United States. That’s why the Internet meme we are checking struck a chord among marijuana-legalization supporters on social media. Still, widely believed doesn’t necessarily mean correct. Did the U.S. government really predict that hemp would, in the course of three decades, make wood obsolete as the raw material for making paper? The notion is not entirely implausible. The Agriculture Department does have ""a lot of pre-World War II material on hemp,"" said Wayne Olson, a librarian at the National Agricultural Library, which is part of the Agriculture Department. That’s because hemp was once a cultivated crop in many states, especially Kentucky. The best known of these Agriculture Department documents is Bulletin 404, which features a pair of studies published in 1916 that investigate the plausibility of using hemp hurds -- a part of the hemp plant -- to make paper. This document has played a key role in the arguments of those who support legalizing hemp and marijuana, due partly to numerous citations in The Emperor Wears No Clothes, a book initially published in 1985 by the late Jack Herer, a pro-cannabis activist. Herer’s volume has been widely read within the pro-cannabis community, though it’s been questioned by historians for the quality of its scholarship. Even though Bulletin 404 was mentioned at several points in The Emperor Wears No Clothes, Herer’s book never makes the claim circulating in the Internet meme we’re checking. More to the point, when we looked at Bulletin 404 itself, we couldn’t find any reference to a prediction that ""by the 1940s all paper would come from hemp."" The papers that comprise Bulletin 404 are highly technical, dwelling on matters such as how much caustic soda was used in the tests and how to measure ""unsieved hurds."" Truth be told, the authors’ powers of prediction were rather faulty. They wrote that ""there appears to be little doubt that under the present system of forest use and consumption, the present supply can not withstand the demands placed upon it."" As anyone who uses paper knows, that certainly didn’t come to pass. Nor did the authors’ prediction that, ""without doubt, hemp will continue to be one of the staple agricultural crops of the United States."" And even that is not the same thing as predicting that all paper will eventually come from hemp. So Bulletin 404 is a dead end. What about other papers? Tom Murphy, the National Outreach Coordinator with the group Vote Hemp, pointed us to one additional document dating from around the same time -- a 72-page chapter from the Yearbook of the United States Department of Agriculture for 1913. But this document didn’t make the claim we’re checking, either. Olson of the National Agricultural Laboratory was skeptical that the claim actually exists somewhere in the department’s archives. ""I have been here since 1987 and have a pretty good idea what’s in the collection, but I have not heard that quote,"" he said. And Joseph Schwarz of the National Archives and Records Administration said that his office, at our request, searched the general correspondence on hemp for 1916 and 1917 as well as the Online Public Access Catalog. Such a claim could not be located, he said. Academics expressed skepticism that the claim was made. ""I never encountered this statement,"" said Michael Schaller, a University of Arizona historian. ""At various times there have been many claims about hemp, so it is possible someone, somewhere, sometime, said it. But I have not seen it in any original source."" Ralph Weisheit, a professor of criminal justice sciences at Illinois State University and author of Domestic Marijuana: A Neglected Industry, agreed that ""it doesn't sound right. This was a time in our nation's history when trees were abundant, and I'd be surprised if a government agency was completely ruling them out as a source for paper."" Ten other experts told PolitiFact that they had never heard of this claim, had never seen it persuasively documented, or both. ""I have read Bulletin 404 carefully and can see no such claim,"" said Samuel Thayer, an expert in edible wild plants, author of The Forager’s Harvest, and creator of the Hemphoax.org website, which casts doubt on a wide variety of claims by hemp advocates. ""It is possible the source is something else, but since I have not seen the claim referenced to any document in particular, and I know of no other USDA document regarding hemp from that year, that is my working hypothesis about where it came from."" Our ruling The Facebook post said that ""in 1916, the U.S. government predicted that by the 1940s all paper would come from hemp and that no more trees would need to be cut down."" The most plausible source for this -- Bulletin 404 -- is silent on this claim, and neither our own research nor any of the dozen experts we asked was able to come up with a definitive source. As with all claims of this type, it’s impossible to prove a negative, so we are willing to re-rate this claim if credible evidence emerges. However, our best efforts have turned up nothing more than a puff of smoke",False,"January 17, 2014"
"Florida’s proposed medical marijuana amendment ""would make Florida one of the most lenient medical-marijuana states, allowing use for limitless ‘other conditions’ specified by any physician.""","If there’s one issue sure to spark up a debate in Florida, it’s medical marijuana. United for Care, a medical marijuana advocacy group, is in the middle of a petition campaign to place a medicinal cannabis bill on the November ballot. The campaign has until Feb. 1 to qualify, but Attorney General Pam Bondi isn’t waiting that long. On Oct. 24 her office filed a challenge to the Florida Supreme Court, arguing that the summary of the amendment on the ballot is designed to mislead voters. The court heard arguments on Dec. 5, 2013, and has until April 1, 2014, to rule. Among the claims made in the brief is that the 74-word summary doesn’t go far enough to explain the extent of how the amendment would affect state law. ""The proposal hides the fact that the Amendment would make Florida one of the most lenient medical-marijuana states, allowing use for limitless ‘other conditions’ specified by any physician,"" the brief reads. ""With no ‘condition’ off limits, physicians could authorize marijuana for anything, any time, to anyone, of any age,"" it continues. ""But rather than tell voters of this extraordinary scope, the summary uses language to prey on voters’ understandable sympathies for Florida’s most vulnerable patients — those suffering ‘debilitating diseases.’ "" We’re not here to dispute whether the proposal is hiding anything from voters; that’s for the state Supreme Court to decide. But is Florida’s proposed amendment lenient compared with the rest of the country’s medical marijuana laws? It’s going to take us some time to roll that one up. Allowing medical marijuana for 'other conditions' Twenty states currently have medical marijuana laws, and all of them have at least a partial list of specific medical diagnoses that can be treated with cannabis. These diseases typically include cancer, AIDS, glaucoma, or wasting syndromes like cachexia, although the lists vary by state. (We should note that among those 20 states, Colorado and Washington state voted in 2012 to decriminalize marijuana altogether.) The Florida amendment spells out its covered diagnoses as cancer, glaucoma, AIDS, hepatitis C, ALS, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis. But it also allows for ""other conditions for which a physician believes that medical use of marijuana would likely outweigh the potential health risks for a patient."" Any other use would have to fall under that rather open-ended description. It’s the ""other conditions"" that Bondi and others say is a major loophole. Florida Sheriffs Association President Grady Judd has argued that by using the term ""condition,"" there’s a virtually unlimited number of ways that can be applied, including muscle spasms and menstrual cramps. We found that Mostly True. Other state laws use words like ""other conditions"" to allow for diseases or symptoms not mentioned in their statutes. Usually there is a process to petition a state board or other group to allow medical marijuana use for one of those conditions after it’s approved by a doctor. Florida’s law would not require the creation of such a board to approve a disease or symptom not listed -- only that a doctor give a written recommendation.  (To abide by federal law, no state requires a prescription, only a recommendation.) Only two other states, California and Massachusetts, have laws that are that relaxed. Massachusetts only requires written consent from a doctor, while California lets patients get medical marijuana with merely verbal recommendations (for example, a dispensary calls a doctor to verify a patient who doesn’t have written documentation, which is an uncommon occurrence). Neither state requires a board to approve requests. United for Care campaign manager Ben Pollara said the loose requirements for the approval process in Florida was by design. ""Health care decisions should be made between a doctor and their patient not by whether it is included or excluded on an arbitrary list drawn up by lawyers, politicians or bureaucrats,"" he told PolitiFact Florida. Other states have slightly stricter guidelines for what constitutes a non-specified conditions. Alaska, for example, has an approval process for any ""debilitating medical condition"" with symptoms such as pain, nausea or seizures. Montana gives leeway for severe pain with a second doctor’s opinion. New Hampshire makes exceptions for other conditions including severe pain or if current treatments result in side effects like nausea, vomiting or muscle spasms. New Mexico also allows for severe pain, if a doctor and the state agree other treatments won’t work (hospice patients are allowed, too). Vermont will let patients treat severe pain, severe nausea, or seizures if other efforts have failed -- or if those conditions are caused by other treatments. Jennifer Meale, communications director for Bondi’s office, confirmed to PolitiFact Florida that the wording in the initial brief was intended to apply only to the amendment language referring to ""other conditions,"" which are described as ""debilitating diseases"" in the ballot summary. ""Other aspects of the amendment weren’t considered in this way,"" she said. ""That’s the portion that was misleading."" Cultivation, distribution and possession restrictions In regards to overall leniency, however, there is much more to consider than just the definition of what could be covered. The Florida law would not, for instance, protect patients growing their own plants, which 15 states permit to some degree. Michigan and Montana, for example, don’t specify there have to be medical marijuana dispensaries, according to pro-legislation Marijuana Policy Project spokesman Dan Riffle, so cultivation at home is a common method for patients to maintain a supply of the drug. Arizona lets you grow marijuana plants if you live more than 25 miles from a dispensary. Instead, the Florida amendment outlines that the state department of health or some other designated agency must regulate a dispensary network, a requirement by 14 states. (States are limited to regulating the distribution network instead of operating it, lest the states open themselves up to a violation of federal law.) Furthermore, the proposal does not contain wording on possession limits, which also vary by state. ""Most allow 2 to 2.5 ounces, but some are as low as one ounce, and some are as high as 24 ounces,"" Riffle said. ""The Florida initiative leaves that up to the Department of Health to determine, and they'll probably say 1 to 2 ounces if this passes."" Riffle added the amendment also does not carry any protections for housing or employment discrimination against patients or caregivers. One example he gives is how in Arizona, a licensed patient cannot be fired from a job for failing a drug test. The Florida law makes no mention of such instances. Riffle said the Florida proposal overall ""is a relatively average medical marijuana law,"" not as restrictive as places like Connecticut, Illinois or New Jersey, but not as liberal as California, Arizona or Massachusetts. Vanderbilt Law School professor Robert Mikos agreed that by using the term ""conditions"" in its language for recommendations, the Florida amendment is ""on the lenient side."" But, he added, ""it looks like Florida is going the more restrictive route by requiring the use of treatment centers and licensing and regulation through the state."" Even the language for doctor recommendations is a little stricter, he said, such as saying the benefits of approved cannabis use ""would likely outweigh the potential health risks,"" instead of wording it that drug use ""might benefit"" a patient, as is used by some other states. Our ruling Bondi’s office is arguing the proposed Florida Amendment is worded loosely enough in its definitions of what could be treated by the drug that it would put it in league with ""the most lenient medical-marijuana states."" The Florida proposal would allow doctors to make recommendations for marijuana use without getting approval from a designated state agency, a rare guideline. Only two states with medical marijuana laws, California and Massachusetts, allow patients to obtain cannabis this way. But if we look at the amendment’s approach to regulation, distribution and registration, it’s a different picture. Florida actually places plenty of restrictions on these categories, moving the proposal closer to the middle of the pack. Bondi’s brief didn’t focus on those other considerations. Some outside experts feel it’s a little misleading to say Florida will become ""one of the most lenient medical-marijuana states"" without explicitly couching it in terms of getting an unspecified condition approved for treatment with only a doctor’s written recommendation",Mostly True,"December 17, 2013"
"""Whether the Amendment passes or not, the medical use of marijuana is a federal criminal offense.""","Almost half the nation has reefer madness these days, with 20 states having passed laws allowing medical marijuana, or outright decriminalizing it. But the office of Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi suggests making it crystal clear to voters that even if a proposed constitutional amendment legalizing cannabis for medicinal purposes makes it to the November ballot and passes, users will still be breaking the law -- United States law, that is. ""The summary suggests that medical marijuana is permissible under federal law,"" Bondi’s office said in an initial brief filed Oct. 24, challenging the proposal in Florida Supreme Court. ""In reality, whether the Amendment passes or not, the medical use of marijuana is a federal criminal offense."" With so many states allowing marijuana -- medical or otherwise -- to be consumed by the public, this claim seems to often be overlooked, so we figured it was time to clear the air. Use and abuse Whether the proposed amendment even makes it is dependent on advocates collecting 700,000 confirmed signatures by Feb. 1. Even if the petition is approved, the Florida Supreme Court has until April 1, 2014, to rule on the attorney general’s challenge. If voters pass the law, it would allow registered patients with cancer, glaucoma, AIDS, hepatitis C, ALS, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis or other conditions approved by a doctor to obtain marijuana for medicinal purposes. Bondi’s brief also says the law would ""would make Florida one of the most lenient medical-marijuana states, allowing use for limitless ‘other conditions’ specified by any physician,"" a claim we rated Mostly True. All marijuana legislation is written to apply only to state laws. Under the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, marijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug, which is defined as having a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use. Proponents of decriminalizing marijuana disagree with that definition. Dan Riffle, director of federal policies for the pro-legislation Marijuana Policy Project, said there are obvious, widely used medical applications (such as pain relief and appetite stimulation). He said no other drug, from Lipitor to Oxycodone, must specify its exact use like medical marijuana laws do. But even with that in mind, no matter how many states pass marijuana laws, even advocates like Riffle freely admit that the use, possession, manufacturing and distribution of the drug remains a federal no-no. The Controlled Substances Act imposes strict penalties on marijuana users, growers and sellers. A first misdemeanor offense for possession in any amount can result in a $1,000 fine and a year in prison, climbing for subsequent offenses to as much as $5,000 and three years. Selling cannabis is considered a felony. Punishments range from a $250,000 fine and 5 years in prison to as much as $10 million and up to life for selling 1,000 kilograms or more. Penalties double if the sale is to a minor or within 1,000 feet of a school, playground or public housing. Cultivating cannabis plants carries similar penalties, contingent on the volume. Feds let states take the lead Even with federal law on the books prohibiting marijuana, there are reasons users and distributors aren’t constantly being busted by the Drug Enforcement Agency. There is a continuing debate over state rights versus federal control, and decriminalizing marijuana is a flashpoint. ""Just because federal law bans something doesn’t mean states have to,"" George Mason University law professor Ilya Somin said. Whether the U.S. government can enforce policy that contradicts state law is another matter. The 2005 U.S. Supreme Court case Gonzales vs. Raich established the federal government has the right to use the Commerce Clause of the Constitution to regulate homegrown marijuana, even when it’s for approved medicinal use. DEA officials destroyed Oakland, Calif., resident Angel Raich’s homegrown marijuana plants in 2002, despite the fact Raich’s possession was legal under California’s Proposition 215 medical marijuana law, which was passed in 1996. Raich sued the federal government and lost, but California’s law was not affected. The ruling showed that the federal government cannot force states to criminalize something (marijuana, in this case), but can enforce its own laws. Since then, several states have still shrugged at federal guidelines, passing their own medical marijuana laws. Colorado and Washington state last year decriminalized cannabis use outright. This has led to a recent softening of the federal government’s stance on the drug. On Aug. 29, U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued a memorandum to federal attorneys that apparently relaxed Washington’s attitudes about marijuana. The memo included new guidelines focusing on cartels or other criminal organizations -- for example, distribution to minors, cultivating plants on public land, committing violence to distribute the drug or using state-regulated operations as a cover for illicit activities. Otherwise, the Justice Department is content to allow state and local agencies ""to address marijuana activity through enforcement of their own narcotics laws."" Indeed, raids of growing operations are infrequent, and prosecution of individuals in those states is nearly unheard of. That’s not to say these guidelines can’t or won’t change, Somin said. When Attorney General Eric Holder or President Barack Obama leave office or if they change their minds, the priorities of the Justice Department may shift again. Federal prosecutors could ignore the guidelines and root out medical marijuana users anyway. United for Care, the group pushing for the Florida initiative, said the lack of enforcement is an integral part of what makes medical marijuana laws possible, and is at the heart of the proposed amendment. ""Our aim is not to set up a marijuana business,"" campaign manager Ben Pollara said. ""We want safe access to medical marijuana."" Bondi’s office, meanwhile, doesn’t see it that way. ""Currently it is illegal,"" communications director Jennifer Meale said. ""Whether there are other considerations doesn’t change the fact that it is illegal."" Our ruling There are a lot of talking points about medical marijuana being passed around in Florida, but one immutable fact underlies the pro- and anti-marijuana lobbies: The federal government considers cannabis an illegal drug by law. Whether that’s the way it should be depends on your point of view. Proponents point to current federal administrative guidelines that deprioritize marijuana prosecution, saying that state preferences equal de facto law. The state attorney general says that even if the U.S. Attorney General’s Office says it’s not focusing on medical marijuana laws, that doesn’t change the Controlled Substances Act. Only Congress could do that. Even with the caveats implied by the U.S. government’s recent guidance, Bondi’s office declared ""whether the Amendment passes or not, the medical use of marijuana is a federal criminal offense."" Whether you’re a supporter of states’ rights or not, she’s correct",True,"December 17, 2013"
"""The 'Denver Post' has actually hired an editor to promote pot.""","The Denver Post’s decision to hire a ""pot editor"" to cover the legal recreational use of marijuana in Colorado has drawn the ire of Bill O’Reilly, who twice in four days attacked the newspaper on his Fox News program. Among other things, O’Reilly called the Post’s top editor a pinhead and warned that the paper was promoting intoxication that would put more dangerous drivers on the road. ""The Denver Post has actually hired an editor to promote pot,"" O’Reilly exclaimed on Monday’s show. Both of his guests on Monday’s show pushed back. Mary Katharine Ham argued that this was a legitimate matter of public policy. Juan Williams said since pot would soon be legal in Colorado, talking about it would be no different from the wine reviews you can find in many newspapers. O’Reilly would have none of it. ""You can drink wine without getting inebriated,"" he said. The only reason to use marijuana, O’Reilly said, ""is to get high."" We reached out to Fox News for more details from the show and did not hear back. This fact-check focuses on whether the Denver Post is promoting pot, but O’Reilly and his guests raised some important points and we’ll cover some of them too. Reporting vs. endorsing We should be clear that O’Reilly did not say the Post’s coverage would have the unintended effect of encouraging the consumption of marijuana. He said promotion was the newspaper’s intent, calling the Post a ""very far left concern."" We can never be entirely certain when it comes to intent but here is how the newly appointed editor, Ricardo Baca, described the scope of his mandate. ""We will have voices in the mix from all sides of the story,"" Baca said in an article published by his paper. ""You smoke (or eat or vaporize) everyday. You got high once in high school and never again. You stopped after you had kids but are thinking about returning. You’re anti-pot and wish it weren’t one of the biggest issues in Colorado. I want to talk with all of you."" Baca promised that the beat would cover cannabis culture and news ""from a professional, journalistic and critical point of view."" So yes, the Post will have a freelance pot critic and a freelance pot adviser, but it will also use staff reporters to follow how the legalization of marijuana unfolds in the state that has gone further than any other (although Washington runs a close second). Colorado’s unique status makes the Post’s work very intriguing to Dr. Eric Wish, director of the Center for Substance Abuse Research at the University of Maryland. ""People have been debating this for a long time and there’s been no place where we could have an experiment to see what happens.,"" Wish said. ""Now the voters made Colorado the experiment. Anything that the Denver Post can do to inform people of the consequences of this experiment is going to be good. We need  to know."" The Post’s editor says he expects the new beat to engage the public. That can mean many things. Safe to say, the newspaper plans to attract readers. That’s a long way from encouraging people to use marijuana. Comparing cannabis and alcohol Coloradans voted on a measure that aimed to treat marijuana the same as alcohol. Opponents, such as O’Reilly, would maintain that the two chemicals are so fundamentally different, we should never confuse them in our minds or our laws. We can’t resolve that dispute, but our research did produce some useful data. First, coverage of beer, wine and spirits is widespread. Barbara Fusco, director of sales and marketing at the Brewers Association, a beer trade group, searched one database and found 168 reporters and editors who report on beer, wine and spirits at daily newspapers nationwide. ""I’d consider this number low, as it doesn’t include magazines, newswires, blogs, websites or broadcast outlets,"" Fusco said. ""Of those, 168 reporters, 60 are specifically identified as covering beer."" That’s about twice as many beer reporters from five years ago when the association said fewer than three dozen papers had regular coverage. Arnie Robbins, executive director of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, says based on what he’s seen, newspapers are expanding the space they give to all kinds of alcoholic drinks. ""On the New York Times baby boomer blog they have a column called A Quiet Drink,"" Robbins said. ""They cover where can you find a cool bar that isn’t crazy loud and it’s about the drinks there."" We visited A Quiet Drink and read about an ""iced black tea made with Jim Beam bourbon, simple syrup and cardamom pods"" and a mai tai ""with two kinds of rum — Zacapa 23 and Cana Brava — and a pleasant undercurrent of orange, from Creole Shrubb liqueur."" To our eye, this wouldn’t seem to discourage drinking. But O’Reilly’s main point was that you can drink without getting drunk while getting stoned is the only reason to smoke pot. This made us curious. Can we calibrate the effects of alcohol in ways that we can’t with pot? ""It may be a false dichotomy to say you can do it with alcohol but not marijuana,"" said Wish at the University of Maryland. Wish pointed to reports of people who have used marijuana medically and were given the choice of using pills or smoking the drug. They said they were able to control the effects more precisely by smoking. Wish has many concerns about the consequences of legalization. He warns about the combined impact on driving with both alcohol and marijuana in the blood stream. He says if legal pot is taxed at too high a rate, it could encourage the use of cheaper synthetic cannabis which can be a very risky compound. But as to our relative ability to manage our consumption of alcohol and marijuana, he says we should not assume we do a great job with either. ""I’m not so sure people calibrate so well once they get inebriated,"" Wish said. Our ruling O’Reilly said the Denver Post was a ""far left concern"" that had ""actually hired an editor to promote pot"". This goes to the newspaper's intent. The Denver Post said it planned to cover many aspects of the unfolding story of legalized marijuana in the state, ranging from policy and laws to the culture of pot users. While that coverage has yet to unfold, the stated goals of the Post do not match O’Reilly’s description of the newspaper’s intentions and we heard nothing from the show that supported O’Reilly’s view",False,"December 12, 2013"
"Florida’s proposed amendment for medical marijuana would allow ""people who alleged minor ailments such as muscle spasms, neck pain, back pain and even menstrual cramps (to qualify) for government-sanctioned pot-smoking.""","According to the latest poll, public support for legalizing medical marijuana in Florida is high (pun intended). If the language for the ballot initiative gets past the Florida Supreme Court, voters will have their say in November 2014, when they’re asked to approve an amendment to state Constitution. But the initiative as a whole still has its fair share of critics, including many law enforcement officials. Grady Judd, president of the Florida Sheriffs Association, wrote an editorial opposing the amendment in the Sun-Sentinel, criticizing the ballot measure as essentially marijuana legalization. ""Authors of the amendment have included a truck-sized loophole in the definition of debilitating diseases, which changes the word disease into ‘condition.’ And what constitutes a valid ‘condition?’ "" Judd wrote. ""Any condition where the ‘use of marijuana would likely outweigh the potential health risks’ of someone who claimed to be sick. This means people who alleged minor ailments such as muscle spasms, neck pain, back pain and even menstrual cramps have qualified for government-sanctioned pot-smoking."" PolitiFact Florida wanted to check out what conditions patients could get medical marijuana licenses for under the proposed Florida law. The amendment Let’s start by taking a look at the proposed medical marijuana amendment text. The ballot summary reads: ""Allows the medical use of marijuana for individuals with debilitating diseases as determined by a licensed Florida physician. Allows caregivers to assist patients’ medical use of marijuana. The Department of Health shall register and regulate centers that produce and distribute marijuana for medical purposes and shall issue identification cards to patients and caregivers. Applies only to Florida law. Does not authorize violations of federal law or any non-medical use, possession or production of marijuana."" So when a doctor prescribes cannabis, the Department of Health will issue the patient a license. Under Florida law, patients would not be able to grow their own plants. Approved patients could purchase marijuana from registered, state-regulated centers. The amendment says how the centers will operate with regard to registration, record-keeping and safety would be determined by the department after passage. Because medical marijuana would be legally dispensed, the program is government approved. However, saying it’s ""government-sanctioned"" isn’t quite right, because government officials are not encouraging marijuana use, as the definition of the word ""sanction"" would imply. In the amendment text itself, which goes beyond the ballot summary, we get a list of qualifying diseases: And here’s the part that Judd referred to: ""or other conditions for which a physician believes that the medical use of marijuana would likely outweigh the potential health risks for a patient."" That means it’s up to doctors to determine if patients could benefit from using medical marijuana. Judd draws a comparison between what the proposed amendment in Florida would allow and what patients in other states have experienced. Out of the 20 states (plus the District of Columbia) that have legalized medical marijuana, only California and Massachusetts have requirements similar to Florida’s proposal that allow for physician discretion when it comes to qualifying conditions. Most other states have a finite list of conditions, but say that the health department could add more or assign waivers. So Florida’s amendment would have a more relaxed standard than most states. When we reached out to Judd, his spokesman told us that it’s clear medical marijuana access would not be limited to what he referred to as ""debilitating"" illnesses. Other critics of medical marijuana have pointed out that any system, even in states with stricter rules, is not immune to loopholes and abuse. For example, an Arizona TV station reported that 90 percent of cardholders in the state claimed chronic pain. However, the biggest age group claiming chronic pain was 18- to 30-year-olds, even though chronic pain is more common in older adults. So we can understand why Judd’s editorial speculates about the possibility that some healthy individuals will try to acquire licenses. Experts say So we know Florida has a flexible definition of which conditions qualify a patient for medical marijuana, which supports Judd’s point. But should the conditions he lists really be considered ""minor ailments""? University of California, San Francisco doctor Donald Abrams has studied the effects of cannabis on cancer and HIV patients. Based on his experience treating and studying chronic illnesses, he said the conditions Judd listed are often serious. ""Some of these things that your sheriff considers to be trivial require people to take opiates,"" Abrams said, adding that these medications (such as morphine) are less safe than marijuana. Several experts pointed out that muscle spasms are a common symptom of multiple sclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease that would already be greenlighted for medical marijuana treatment if the Florida amendment passes. Neck pain, back pain and menstrual cramps are also frequently treated with prescription pain medication. Today chronic pain affects about 100 million U.S. adults, according to the American Academy of Pain Medicine. Oh, and as for menstrual cramps, ladies? Abrams said Queen Victoria opted for a little marijuana therapy to relieve her pain in the 19th century. So yes, Judd is right that someone with one of these ailments would be eligible for a medical marijuana license at a physician’s discretion. But it’s a misleading generalization to describe these conditions as ""minor."" Our ruling Judd said that people with ""minor ailments"" could get access to marijuana if Florida’s proposed amendment passes next year. He mentioned spasms and other chronic pain as a minor condition, when sometimes those conditions are quite serious. But compared to most other states, Florida’s ballot language is flexible because it allows for physicians to determine whether a patient’s condition qualifies for a license",Mostly True,"November 25, 2013"
"""Nobody's addicted to"" marijuana.","High-profile Orlando attorney John Morgan is leading an effort in Florida to legalize medical marijuana, arguing that the drug is safer and cheaper than other painkillers. As a recent guest on Bay News 9’s Political Connections, Morgan also discussed whether marijuana is addictive. ""Nobody's addicted to it,"" Morgan claimed. We decided to fact-check Morgan’s claim based on input from readers. But we didn’t have to dig too far. Morgan told us he was wrong. ""It was a huge mistake,"" said Morgan. ""I’m sorry and embarrassed I messed up."" Morgan said he was ""flat out wrong"" about marijuana not being addictive and meant to focus on the use of the drug compared to more potent painkillers. ""Some levels of addiction kill you -- marijuana may make you slow, but it will never kill you,"" said Morgan, a personal injury attorney who is leading the group People United for Medical Marijuana. The group has launched a petition drive to add an amendment to the state’s Constitution to legalize medical marijuana in 2014. Even though Morgan said he made a mistake, we were curious enough to check a few more sources. Aaron Norton, a psychotherapist who specializes in addictive disorders, said that ""cannabis dependence is a diagnosable disorder.""  ""Not everyone who uses it becomes addicted,"" said Norton, but some are more vulnerable, including people with mental disorders, adolescents and young adults. ""In the course of my career, I have probably treated hundreds of patients who are cannabis-dependent, and many of them also met the two diagnostic criteria associated with physiological dependence -- tolerance and withdrawal,"" Norton said.    Marijuana abuse is recognized as cannabis-use disorder in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The manual’s list of symptoms include craving; taking larger doses over a longer period of time than intended; recurrent use that results in failure to fulfill major obligations at work, school or home; and tolerance (needing more to get the desired high). It’s also described as an addictive substance by the government-funded National Institute on Drug Abuse, which writes: ""Estimates from research suggest that about 9 percent of users become addicted to marijuana; this number increases among those who start young (to about 17 percent, or 1 in 6) and among daily users (to 25-50 percent)."" Psychiatrist Dr. Darren Rothschild, an addiction medicine specialist, says he’s worked with patients who have developed a serious dependence on marijuana and ""the impact is substantial."" ""In order to feel normal, they have to have the drug,"" Rothschild said. ""Not everyone who smokes becomes addicted, but it’s erroneous to say it doesn’t happen."" Rothschild said people who smoke marijuana daily over a long period of time are the ones most susceptible to dependence on marijuana versus intermittent smokers who may occasionally smoke pot at a party. ""I’d say none of those people are addicted."" Dr. Samir Sabbag, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Division of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Treatment and Research, said ""long-term use of marijuana is indeed addictive,"" though he noted people can be addicted to a variety of things, including the caffeine in chocolate and coffee.  Even groups that support relaxing marijuana laws, such as the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), concede that Morgan was incorrect to say that marijuana is not potentially addictive. ""Can people have an abusive relationship with marijuana? Absolutely,"" said NORML executive director Allen St. Pierre. But St. Pierre says marijuana is ""not addictive in any way shape or form the same way that alcohol, nicotine and other legal and illegal drugs, even caffeine, can cause serious withdrawal."" Our ruling Orlando attorney John Morgan said that ""nobody’s addicted to"" marijuana. Morgan quickly admitted that he was wrong, and experts agreed",False,"October 8, 2013"
"Marijuana is ""less toxic"" than alcohol.","Just as fans were filing into the Brickyard 400 NASCAR race at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, a big television screen by the entrance displayed a pro-pot ad with the headline ""A new beer?"" The ad, which opens with smiling young adults hoisting their brew mugs, drew outrage from lots of sources, including the St. Petersburg-based Drug Free America Foundation. The TV screen company, Grazie Media, pulled the ad after a few hours. The ad said: ""If you’re an adult who enjoys a good beer, there’s a similar product you might want to know about, one without all the calories and serious health problems. Less toxic so it doesn’t cause hangovers or overdose deaths. And it’s not linked to violence or reckless behavior. Marijuana. Less harmful than alcohol and time to treat it that way."" In this fact-check, we decided to focus on the idea that marijuana is ""less toxic"" than alcohol. ""I don’t see how this could be a more open-and-shut case,"" Mason Tvert, communications director for the Marijuana Policy Project, which produced the ad, told PolitiFact Florida in an email. ""If you consume too much alcohol in a sitting or over the course of your life, you can die. If you consume too much (marijuana) in a sitting or over the course of your life, you do not die.  What more could be needed to prove marijuana is ‘less toxic’ than alcohol?"" Yet, as a rebuttal, some health professionals say it’s a matter of picking your poison.   ""It’s like trying to compare different weapons. Both have the potential to cause harm,"" said Dr. Scott Teitelbaum, professor and vice chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and chief of the Division of Addiction Medicine, at University of Florida. ""I don’t know that there’s a clear answer."" For starters, the term toxic can be vague. Dr. Cynthia Lewis-Younger, medical director of the Florida Poison Information Center in Tampa, said toxic can be ""anything that causes harm. It is possible to drink enough water to poison yourself. It’s more related to the dose than anything else."" The Marijuana Policy Project’s claim that marijuana is ""less toxic"" rankles some health professionals and anti-drug organizations who criticize the inference that using the drug is okay. Calvina Fay, executive director of the Drug Free America Foundation, said she wants the public to realize that ""these are two drugs that are both addictive and impairing and they both create unsafe situations."" Briefly, here’s a look at how the National Institute on Drug Abuse describes each drug. Alcohol is produced by the fermentation of yeast, sugars and starches and while it may start as a stimulant in small doses, NIDA describes it as a central nervous system depressant that is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and small intestine into the bloodstream. Intoxication can impair brain function and motor skills and heavy use can increase risk of certain cancers, stroke, and liver disease. Marijuana is a dry, shredded green and brown mix of leaves, flowers, stems and seeds from the hemp plant Cannabis sativa. The main psychoactive (mind-altering) chemical in marijuana is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. When marijuana is smoked, THC rapidly passes from the lungs into the bloodstream, which carries the chemical to the brain and other organs. Activists on both sides of the marijuana issue can find studies that back up their claims about the health impact of smoking weed. NIDA states in an email that the effect of marijuana can depend on the person (their biology) who’s using it, the amount and under what circumstances. ""Claiming that marijuana is less toxic than alcohol cannot be substantiated since each possess their own unique set of risks and consequences for a given individual,"" according to an agency email statement. Statistics certainly paint a grim picture of the lethal impact of alcohol abuse. The Centers for Disease Control’s National Center for Health Statistics reports that there were 41,682 deaths attributed to alcohol in 2010, the last year with the most exact statistics. That breaks down to 15,990 deaths attributed to alcoholic liver disease and 25,692 other alcohol-induced deaths, excluding accidents and homicides. The center doesn’t have any reports of marijuana listed as a cause of death. In 2006, there were more than 1.2 million emergency room visits and 2.7 million physician office visits due to excessive drinking, the CDC reports on its website. ""Alcohol in excess is probably the No. 1 cause of toxicities from drugs of abuse in the world simply because it’s most widely used,"" Lewis-Younger said. Robert Gable wrote in an American Scientist article in 2006 that ""simply tallying the number of people who die or who show up at emergency rooms is, by itself, meaningless,"" because that figure is influenced by the number of people using the substance. Yet the Marijuana Policy Project’s Tvert said Gable’s eight-year study on recreational drugs bolsters their assertion. Gable, a retired professor of psychology at Claremont Graduate University in California, compared the toxicity of 20 abused substances using reports of experimental human and animal research and on published data of overdose fatalities. He compared the drugs by developing a safety ratio -- the ratio of an effective dose (eliciting a ""relaxed affability"") to a lethal dose. ""Two drinks makes you buzzy, 20 drinks puts you in the emergency room or the morgue,"" Gable said in a phone interview. ""Ten is the safety ratio"" for alcohol, among the most toxic recreational drugs, he said. The least physiologically toxic substances -- those requiring 100 to 1,000 times the effective dose to cause death -- included marijuana when ingested. He couldn’t find any cases of documented deaths from smoked marijuana ""so the actual dose is a mystery."" ""No drug is good for teenagers,"" he said,  ""but when it comes to the chances of immediate death by chemical toxicity, marijuana is about a hundred times less toxic than alcohol or cocaine.""      Dr. Ihsan Salloum, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, notes: ""People could argue it (marijuana) is a weaker chemical in terms of toxicity, but it does have its consequences. It doesn’t mean marijuana is harmless."" Experts say one concern is the impact of marijuana on the brain, particularly for teens who start smoking early. Teitelbaum says marijuana can ""flip"" adolescents predisposed to mental problems into having a psychotic disorder. A 2012 study from Duke University, the University of Oregon, King’s College London and the University of Otago (New Zealand) published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, ""Persistent Cannabis Users Show Neuropsychological Decline from Childhood to Midlife,"" examined the potential relationship between the long-term use of marijuana and declines in IQ scores. The study was based on data from more than 1,037 individuals followed from birth until age 38 and determined those who began using cannabis before age 18 and became persistent users (more than once a week) suffered the greatest decline in mental functioning (an average of eight IQ points) that didn’t improve once they stopped. Those who started using marijuana when they were adults didn’t show the same decline. Another concern has come up in recent years. The use of synthetic marijuana, often called Spice, has become a problem, and health professionals caution that it’s vastly different from natural marijuana and more toxic. ""Many Spice smokers have experienced agitation, paranoia and mental illness,"" JoAnn Chambers-Emerson, certified specialist in poison information/educator at the Florida Poison Information Center in Tampa, wrote in an email. ""Some Spice smokers have ended up having a stroke, heart attack, seizures and kidney failure. Synthenetic marijuana, however, is not marijuana.  Our ruling An ad from the Marijuana Policy Project claims marijuana is ""less toxic"" than alcohol.

"Every day, ""about 100 people will be arrested for possession of marijuana in Georgia.""","Weed, pot, ganja, sticky icky, cannabis. Call it what you want, some statewide advocates want it called legal.   It was more than a month before 4/20 (Weed) Day, but supporters for legalizing marijuana were out in Atlanta recently making their case to rewrite the state’s marijuana laws.Georgia has spent billions of tax dollars enforcing ""draconian"" and ineffective prohibition laws against marijuana, the supporters said during Cannabis Awareness Day at the state Capitol.     ""In Georgia, more than 35,000 arrests occur for marijuana offenses each year. Eighty-five percent of those arrests are for possession, accounting for 55 percent of all drug arrests,"" James Bell, the director of Georgia C.A.R.E. (Campaign for Access, Reform and Education), said in a news release. ""Today, March 14, about 100 people will be arrested for possession of marijuana in Georgia.""     PolitiFact Georgia wanted to know whether that many people are actually being arrested each day.     For decades marijuana has been one of the most popular drugs in the nation, even for the most famous among us. Former President Bill Clinton admitted to smoking -- although not inhaling -- it while in college. And President Barack Obama supposedly ran around his high school with the Choom Gang of marijuana-smoking buddies.     In November, voters in Colorado and Washington state approved legislation legalizing marijuana for recreational use. The drug is already legal for medical use in 18 states. But marijuana remains illegal under federal laws, although Obama has said federal law enforcers have ""bigger fish to fry"" than chasing down marijuana users.     Georgia prosecutes marijuana offenses under its Controlled Substances Act, and it has various fines and punishments for growing, buying, selling and possessing the drug. (Georgia also passed its own medical marijuana law in 1980, but the law has never been implemented.)     Bell said his numbers are derived from estimates of FBI arrest data for the state of Georgia. Doing the math on his claim, 85 percent of the 35,000 annual arrests would equal 29,750 arrests for marijuana possession. Dividing that number by 365 days, equals about 81.5 possession arrests each day.     ""We’re fed up with the whole war on drugs,"" he said. His group wanted state lawmakers to consider revising the marijuana laws as part of criminal justice reform, but none of them sponsored any legislation.     We reviewed FBI crime data and found that marijuana accounted for 52.1 percent of all arrests for drug abuse violations nationwide in 2010. And 45.8 percent of those marijuana arrests were for possession. That marijuana arrests figure dropped a bit to 49.5 percent in 2011, with 43.3 percent of those marijuana arrests being for possession.     Marijuana policy researcher Jon Gettman forwarded to PolitiFact data he compiled from FBI data on the same subject. According  to that data, Georgia’s marijuana arrests were:     Year        All marijuana arrests        Marijuana possession arrests   2008            30,289                    26,978 2009            33,200                    28,892 2010            31,506                    28,091   Gettman, a criminal justice professor at Shenandoah University, has also been a past president and national director of NORML, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.     But calculating arrests is a tricky undertaking, Robert Friedmann, a criminology professor at Georgia State University, reminds us. Arrest numbers are nebulous, he said, depending on the way they are counted: Are multiple arrests for a single person counted individually? Do the numbers include local, state and federal activities? Do all jurisdictions report arrests?     An explanation of arrest data on the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program states that the report counts one arrest for each separate instance in which a person is arrested, cited or summoned for an offense. Because a person can be arrested multiple times, the FBI report doesn’t reflect the number of people who have been arrested, but the number of times people are arrested.     So what’s the skinny?     Marijuana legalization advocate James Bell said about 100 Georgians are arrested each day on charges of marijuana possession.     Bell’s claim is based on FBI crime report arrest data. Using that data from the years 2008 through 2010, an average of about 28,000 possession arrests were recorded in Georgia each year. Dividing the average annual possession arrests by 365 days results in about 76.7 marijuana possession arrests each day.     Bell uses that arrest data to estimate the number of people arrested for the violation. But the FBI clearly states this type of estimation that Bell claims is not reflected in their numbers.

Among their concerns is that efforts to legalize the drug may lead teenagers to believe there is no risk of serious harm in using it. Some national surveys say that marijuana use among young people has increased in recent years, after surveyed declines during the late 1990s and early 2000s.

Nancy Devaney is chairwoman of the Ocean State Prevention Alliance, a Rhode Island organization that opposes marijuana legalization. In a Feb. 20 news release from the Alliance, this statement is attributed to her: ""In annual surveys of Rhode Island communities that receive [federal] Drug Free community grants, many report that more than 50 percent of youth surveyed do not think daily marijuana use poses any serious risk of harm.""

PolitiFact Rhode Island contacted Devaney to ask about the claim. She e-mailed us numbers she said came from surveys conducted in five of the eight Rhode Island communities that make up the alliance, which works to pursue grants aimed at preventing and reducing drug use.  

Devaney said the communities conducted the surveys to fulfill requirements of federal grants they received.

Devaney gave us survey numbers but not the survey questions and results, so we sought to verify them. We contacted officials from the communities involved and got  results from six of the eight communities in the Prevention Alliance.

Some of the communities surveyed middle school students and some didn’t, but all surveyed high school students, so we’ll focus on those results.

When we looked at the numbers, things became a bit complicated because the communities asked the question and tabulated the results in different ways.

Tiverton, Middletown and North Kingstown, for example, asked high school students whether daily use of marijuana posed risk of serious harm -- the way Devaney phrased her statement.

But other communities asked variations of the question. For example, some asked whether smoking marijuana a few times a week -- not daily -- posed a serious risk.

And when the responses were tabulated, some grouped results, combining ""moderate"" and ""great risk.""

All of the survey results we reviewed, however, supported Devaney’s general point -- that a majority of young people didn’t believe that regular marijuana use was risky.

PolitiFact Rhode Island also looked at national research.

The survey Monitoring the Future, done yearly by University of Michigan researchers since the 1970s, asked more than 45,000 students in grades 8, 10 and 12 questions including about their perception of the risk of harmfulness of marijuana.

Asked about people who smoke marijuana ""regularly,"" according to Monitoring the Future, about 67 percent of eight graders said great risk.  In the 2012 survey, about 51 percent of 10th graders said great risk of harm for people who smoke marijuana regularly and 44 percent of 12th graders said they perceive great risk of harm.

By contrast, in the early 1990s, the percentages of 12th graders who saw great risk of harm for marijuana were in the high 70s.

A survey released in September 2012 by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, said that nationally 44.8 percent of people ages 12 to 17 in 2011 perceived great risk in smoking marijuana once or twice per week. And less than 28 percent perceived great risk in smoking marijuana once a month.

That survey said that in Rhode Island, from 2010 through 2011, an estimated 21.5 percent of people ages 12 to 17 perceived great risk for those who smoked marijuana once a month.

In other words, the national surveys generally supported Devaney’s claim as well.

Our ruling

Nancy Devaney, chairwoman of Ocean State Prevention Alliance, said in a news release:  ""In annual surveys of RI communities that receive Drug Free community grants, many report that more than 50 percent of RI youth surveyed do not think daily marijuana use poses any serious risk of harm.""

"""Lots of studies seem to indicate that minors find it very easy to get marijuana, easier than to get alcohol.""","State Rep. Edith H. Ajello, D-Providence, recently said legalizing and regulating marijuana in Rhode Island would make it tougher for young people to get the drug, in part by cutting off the underground market that sells to minors and flourishes while marijuana is outlawed.

In a Feb. 6, 2013, Providence Journal story about her bill to legalize marijuana, Ajello said that after years of making marijuana illegal, ""Lots of studies seem to indicate that minors find it very easy to get marijuana, easier than to get alcohol.""

Ajello’s proposal calls for allowing people 21 or older to carry an ounce or less of marijuana and would require regulations for selling, growing and taxation of the drug.

We wondered if it’s really true, as Ajello says, that it’s easier for young people to get marijuana than alcohol.

After we contacted Ajello, we heard from Mason Tvert, an advocate for regulating the use of marijuana rather than prohibiting it. He referred us to various studies.

But we had already found the annual National Survey of American Attitudes on Substance Abuse, which reports that in each of the past three years, young people reported that  it was in fact easier to get alcohol than to get marijuana -- the opposite of what Ajello said.

The most recent edition of that survey, which is conducted by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, and released in August 2012, said ""teens have readier access to alcohol than prescription drugs or marijuana within an hour and within a day.""

Tvert mentioned the same study, noting that from 2002 through 2009 it found that teens thought it was easier to buy marijuana than beer. But, in 2010, the survey changed the wording of the question, asking teenagers whether it was easier to get marijuana than alcohol -- the wording Ajello used.

From 2010 through 2012, the survey states, 26 to 27 percent of teenagers said they could get beer within an hour while 13 to 15 percent of teens said they could get marijuana within an hour.

During the same three-year period, the range for teens who said they could get beer within a day was 46 to 50 percent, while for marijuana within a day it was 29 to 31 percent. (More teens also said they could illegally get prescription drugs within an hour or a day than marijuana).

Why did the wording change?

""Research suggested that teens frequently get substances including tobacco, alcohol and drugs from friends and families,"" rather than buying them, said Emily Feinstein, program director, Policy to Practice, at the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University.

Indeed, another study, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, states that 7.7 percent of people ages 12 to 20 in 2011 said that they purchased the alcohol themselves the last time they drank. A little more than 30 percent of that age group said they paid for the the last alcohol they drank. (The study didn’t ask teens about the ease of purchasing marijuana.)

And the Monitoring the Future study, which is conducted at the University of Michigan and has surveyed about 50,000 8th, 10th and 12th graders in the United States yearly since the 1970s, has found that alcohol access is consistently reported by students in all three grades to be the number-one substance that is ""fairly easy"" or ""very easy"" to get.

Monitoring the Future’s 2012 survey found:

* Nearly 58 percent of 8th graders said it was fairly easy or very easy to get alcohol compared with 37 percent saying the same of marijuana

* More than 78 percent of 10th graders said alcohol was fairly easy or very easy to get while just shy of 69 percent said the same of marijuana.

* Almost 91 percent of 12th graders said alcohol was fairly easy or very easy to get compared with nearly 82 percent saying the same for marijuana.

Monitoring the Future found that students in the three grade levels said every year that alcohol was more easily available than marijuana. According to the Monitoring the Future survey figures, availability of alcohol has decreased since the 1990s -- but so has marijuana availability.

Other studies suggested by Tvert did not address directly teens’ ease of access to marijuana or alcohol. Those studies did say that in the past few years there has been an increase in marijuana use among teenagers, after a period in which use had declined.

Our ruling

Rep. Edith H. Ajello said, ""Lots of studies seem to indicate that minors find it very easy to get marijuana, easier than to get alcohol.""

The verb choice and timing of Ajello’s comment proved crucial here. If she’d referred to how easily young people could purchase one or the other, and she’d said it in 2009, there would be more support.

But all the most recent, credible, national studies we found showed that teenagers report it’s easier to get alcohol than marijuana",False,"February 16, 2013"
"""Eighty percent of those who have applied for licenses have no cancer, no Parkinson's disease or glaucoma. They have nothing you would associate [with] the use of medical marijuana.""","When former U.S. Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, D-.R.I., launched a national group in January that opposes marijuana legalization, he also took issue with medical-marijuana laws that he says may have been well-intended but are misguided.

And he questioned whether many of those who get permission to use marijuana for medical reasons are using it for legitimate reasons.

""Eighty percent of those who have applied for licenses have no cancer, no Parkinson’s disease or glaucoma,"" Kennedy said in a Jan. 8 story  in The Providence Journal. ""They have nothing you would associate [with] the use of medical marijuana.""

(Kennedy’s group, Project SAM, which stands for Smart Approaches to Marijuana, argues that medical marijuana should only be used in non-smoked forms. )

Nineteen states and the District of Columbia allow its medical use, although it is still illegal under federal law.

In addition to cancer and glaucoma, among conditions approved for medical marijuana use are HIV/AIDS, severe or chronic pain, persistent nausea and multiple sclerosis.

We decided to examine both parts of Kennedy’s statement, beginning with the specific ailments people cite when seeking permission to use medical marijuana.

Kennedy’s group referred us to Kevin A. Sabet, a professor and drug policy institute director at the University of Florida, who is a former Obama administration adviser on drug policy and a co-founder of Project SAM. He guided us to statistical links on the  Project SAM website and e-mailed some figures related to medical marijuana programs in Colorado.

The most recent Colorado data, as of Nov. 30, 2012, showed 3 percent of that state’s roughly 107,000 medical-marijuana patients reported having cancer and 1 percent had glaucoma, while Parkinson’s was not listed as a specific reportable condition. Ninety-four percent reported severe pain as their condition or one of their conditions.

We checked with other states and found similar figures.

In most states, including Colorado, medical marijuana patients reported more than one condition.

In Arizona, where medical marijuana became legal in 2010, just under 4 percent of its 33,600 medical marijuana cardholders reported having cancer while 1.5 percent reported glaucoma. By far the most reported condition as of Nov. 7, 2012, was chronic pain at 90 percent.

Nevada, one of the earlier states to legalize marijuana for medical use, adopting it in 2001, showed cancer cases were about 3.6 percent of reported conditions -- and glaucoma just under 2 percent, as of Jan. 8, 2013. Severe pain was overwhelmingly the number-one condition, hovering at more than 3,200 patients monthly.The total number of patients with medical-marijuana cards in Nevada, fluctuates; as of Jan. 8, it was 3,580. In Rhode Island, where medical marijuana became legal in 2009, 5.9 percent percent of those who received approval in 2010 cited cancer or cancer treatment, according to the Department of Health.

Four percent of those getting approval in 2012 reported cancer. Glaucoma accounted for about 1 percent in both years while Parkinson’s is not listed as a separate qualifying diagnosis.  

Rhode Island, which has 4,860 people approved to use medical marijuana in its program, lists a wider range of diagnoses than several states we examined.

Forty-four percent of Rhode Island patients cited ""severe debilitating chronic pain"" in 2012; 17 percent reported muscle spasms and 11 percent reported severe nausea.

So the first part of Kennedy’s statement is right: Only a very small percentage of medical marijuana users cited cancer or glaucoma as their reason for using the drug; states we checked do not specifically list Parkinson’s, indicating few cite that ailment.

What about the second part of the statement, that 80 percent of the people using medical marijuana ""have nothing you would associate"" with it?

Sabet, from Project SAM, said Kennedy didn’t mean that the 80 percent have no legitimate reason to use the drug.

But we think that most readers would understand that statement to mean 80 percent didn’t have an ailment generally associated with medical marijuana use.

The facts show otherwise.

As our research found, chronic pain, severe pain or severe debilitating chronic pain -- the most common conditions medical marijuana users cite -- are among several conditions or diagnoses listed by states as qualifying reasons for using, contingent on whatever standard a state requires applicant and physician to meet.

The states with medical-marijuana laws require some form of sign-off from a physician on an application.

Dr. Syed Rizvi, a neurologist at Rhode Island Hospital and associate professor at Brown University, said the patients he has approved for medical marijuana have included those with multiple sclerosis, are extremely disabled, maybe in extreme pain, and may not have responded well to other medications.  He said he limits it to patients he has seen for some time, even years. Dr. Josiah D. Rich, a professor of medicine and community health at Brown University’s Warren Alpert Medical School, said in his experience and from what he knows of other physicians, there are other legitimate conditions than those Kennedy cited that are legal in states for medical marijuana.

""Some of my patients who have AIDS  … get very nauseous with the medicines they take,"" and therefore are approved to use medical marijuana, Dr. Rich said.

Our ruling

Former U.S. Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy said that ""eighty percent of those who have applied for licenses have no cancer, no Parkinson’s disease or glaucoma"" and that ""they have nothing you would associate [with] the use of medical marijuana.""

Kennedy is right about the comparatively small percentage of medical-marijuana patients who use it for the conditions he named.

But he is wrong that most of those using the drug do so for conditions not associated with it. In fact, states with medical marijuana laws allow use for chronic and severe pain -- the most common conditions cited by patients.

Does everyone who has permission to use medical marijuana actually have a true medical need for it? We don’t know, but neither does Kennedy",Half True,"February 3, 2013"
"""The average age of first marijuana use is 12.""","Former U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., recently organized a national group to oppose the legalization of marijuana. Project SAM, for Smart Approaches to Marijuana, also calls for limiting medical marijuana use to non-smoked forms of the drug.

After the launch of Project SAM, a Providence group called Protect Families First took issue with some of Kennedy’s positions.

Protect Families First, which says it supports ""progressive family values including pro-family marijuana reform,"" agreed with Kennedy on the need to increase resources for treatment of drug abuse and prevention. But the group says it supports strictly regulating, not prohibiting, marijuana use.

The organization also asserted that Kennedy’s position does not address the problem of children’s access to drugs.

In a news release issued Jan. 10 -- the same day Project SAM was announced in Denver -- Protect Families First listed several statistics, including this one: ""The average age of first marijuana use is 12, the lowest ever and still declining.""

That would mean a fair number of kids even younger than 12 are toking up. We wondered whether it was true.

We contacted Protect Families First, whose executive director, Rebecca McGoldrick, checked the information and sent an e-mail later that day saying the statement was wrong. She said a research intern had gotten confused about the numbers.

McGoldrick provided what she said were corrected statistics, citing a couple of studies. One, a national survey by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, an agency created by Congress in 1992 to reduce impact of substance abuse and mental illness on communities, found the average age of first use of marijuana among people ages 12 to 49 was 17.5 years of age in 2011.

Even though it was clear Protect Families First had made a mistake, we were curious enough to check a few more sources.

We examined several studies, including some that indicated an increase in marijuana use among young people over the past few years.

Monitoring the Future, a project run at the University of Michigan, has surveyed about 50,000 8th, 10th and 12th graders in the United States annually since the 1970s about various issues, including drug use. It found that more in the 2000s reported trying marijuana during middle school than in the late 1990s, but the percentages fluctuate.

In the 2010 survey, 26 percent of young people said they first smoked marijuana or hashish as high school freshmen. Second to that was the 21.6 percent who said they first smoked it in ""grade 7 or 8"" -- about ages 12 to 14.

Another report, by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, stated that only 8.1 percent of students nationally first tried marijuana ""before age 13 years.""

And the Rhode Island Department of Health’s latest health risk survey, from 2011, found that 7.1 percent of Rhode Island high school students reported having tried marijuana before age 13.

Our ruling

Protect Families First said in a news release that ""the average age of first marijuana use is 12, the lowest ever and still declining,"" a statement that grabbed our attention because it seemed so unlikely.

After we called them, the organization said that figure was in error.  And none of the studies we found suggested that 12 was the average age for first marijuana use",False,"January 20, 2013"
"""There is no evidence that poor people abuse drugs more frequently than any other socio-economic group.""","A Beaumont legislator opposed to drug-testing applicants for government benefits challenged Republican proponents to mandate testing of candidates for state office.

Democratic Rep. Joe Deshotel urged the unlikely prospect in a Nov. 13, 2012, press release after suggesting Gov. Rick Perry, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and others were targeting struggling Texans without reason.

Perry and Dewhurst had called on the 2013 Legislature, which convenes in January, to authorize drug screening of applicants for unemployment assistance or Temporary Aid for Needy Families, which provides government aid to children and their parents or relatives who are living with them.

Dewhurst said: ""We owe it to Texas taxpayers to structure our welfare and unemployment programs in a way that guarantees recipients are serious about getting back to work.""

Deshotel said in his response: ""There is no evidence that poor people abuse drugs more frequently than any other socio-economic group.""

None?

Deshotel, a House member since 1999, told us by phone that he should have said there is ""little evidence"" that low-income people abuse drugs more than others. By and large, he said, he believes Texans with more disposable income--those with greater wealth--are the biggest users of illegal drugs, especially cocaine.

Deshotel followed up by email, pointing out that in the federal government’s 2007 National Survey of Drug Use and Health, a little over half of unemployed and full-time employees reported trying marijuana. The survey indicates 23 percent of unemployed individuals had tried cocaine, compared to 19 percent of full-time employees and nearly 15 percent of part-time employees.

The annual survey, conducted since 1971, draws on face-to-face interviews of some 70,000 individuals aged 12 and older.

Since the survey does not gauge drug use levels by income level, the closest possible indicator may be job status. In the 2007 survey, nearly 2 percent of unemployed individuals reported more than 100 days of cocaine use in the previous year, compared to 0.4 percent of full-time workers. More than 10 percent of unemployed individuals said they had used marijuana more than 100 days, the survey says, compared to 4 percent of full-time employees.

Last year, PolitiFact Florida touched on the survey while tackling a flip-side version of Deshotel's claim. In June 2011, Florida Gov. Rick Scott told an interviewer: ""Studies show that people that are on welfare are higher users of drugs than people not on welfare.""
   
At the time, Scott’s office pointed out that the government used its 1999 and 2000 surveys to publish a report titled ""Substance Use Among Persons in Families Receiving Government Assistance.""

Among the findings, researchers concluded that ""past-month illicit drug use was higher in assisted families than in unassisted families among persons aged 12 to 64."" Specifically, the report said 9.6 percent of people in families receiving some type of government assistance reported recent drug use, compared to 6.8 percent among people in families receiving no government assistance.

PolitiFact Florida also cited research by Harold Pollack, a University of Chicago professor who studies substance abuse among welfare recipients, suggesting that  ""substance abuse and dependence are relatively uncommon"" for such recipients. Yet the same research found--by reviewing many different surveys--that ""approximately 20 percent of TANF recipients report that they have used an illicit drug at least once in the past year.""
   
Pollack told PolitiFact Florida that compared to other women of the same age, TANF recipients are more likely to use illicit substances, though he said most women who have used an illicit drug in the past year do not meet the diagnosis of being dependent on, or abusing, drugs. A lot of casual marijuana users may well test positive, Pollack said, but they do not have a ""drug problem.""

We ran Deshotel’s statement past Pollack, who called it an oversimplification, though he said substance abuse is widespread and not limited to low-income residents.

Pollack nudged us to contact Beau Kilmer, co-director of the California-based RAND Drug Policy Research Center, which says it provides decision-makers with research on substance use and drug policy. Kilmer emailed us his writing from a 2010 book stating that a ""wealth of evidence"" suggests substance use and poverty are ""closely connected.""

Surveys of the homeless show ""staggering rates of alcohol and drug dependency,"" Kilmer wrote. Like others, Kilmer cited the 2007 federal survey, writing that its results indicate that individuals living below the federal poverty line were 50 percent to 100 percent more likely than individuals with incomes at twice the poverty level to report use of an illicit drug in the past month or dependence/abuse in the past year, he wrote. However, Kilmer wrote, the ""limited scientific literature examining a causal connection between poverty and substance abuse remains unsettled.""

By telephone, Miguel Ferguson, an associate professor at the University of Texas School of Social Work, took issue with Kilmer’s characterization of the differences in illicit drug use suggested by the survey results.

The percentage differences underscored by Kilmer may be statistically significant, Ferguson said, but in real-world social terms, the contrast between 2 percent of survey respondents living at twice the poverty level and above having abused or depended on an illicit drug in the past year compared to 5 percent of individuals living below the poverty line is practically no difference--at best, he said, marginal. ""Given what I know about living in poverty and the stress that people are under, I am shocked that it is that low,"" Ferguson said.

We shared Kilmer’s chapter with Deshotel, who noted by email the slight difference in reported dependence on an illicit drug between the groups, adding: ""My ultimate argument is that there is no significant difference between those who use drugs who are poor and those are not that would warrant the state spending tax dollars to test some beneficiaries and not others.""

Deshotel also pointed out an April 17, 2012, New York Times news article indicating that after Florida imposed drug screens on its applicants for cash benefits, 2.6 percent of applicants failed the test--the most common reason being marijuana--over the first four months, or 108 of 4,086, according to results obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, which won a court order blocking the Florida drug screens. An additional 40 people canceled the tests without taking them, the newspaper said.

Separately, we asked the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a federal agency that supports research to prevent and treat drug abuse and addiction and mitigate consequences, to evaluate Deshotel’s statement. By email, Susan Weiss, the institute’s scientific adviser to its director, told us through a spokeswoman: ""There are a variety of factors that can contribute to drug abuse, socio-economic status being one of them, along with family support, peers/siblings that use drugs, genetics"" and ""school problems. Being poor doesn’t necessarily put you at risk, nor does being rich protect you from risk.""

All that said, Weiss later said, poverty can be a major stressor in a person’s life leading to drug use.

In 2011, Florida’s ACLU offered other government and academic research for PolitiFact Florida to consider.

Researchers at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, a part of the National Institutes of Health, published findings in 1996 that said welfare recipients ""using, abusing, or dependent on alcohol or illicit drugs are consistent with proportions of both the adult U.S. population and adults who do not receive welfare.""
   
The research relied on 1992 data and concluded that drug use among welfare recipients ranged between 1.3 to 3.6 percent, compared to 1.5 percent for non-welfare recipients.
   
The caveats here are much like the government research Scott’s office highlighted. Namely, it includes other types of welfare than cash assistance, and it's old. The report was published in 1996 and relies on 1992 data.
   
Another researcher used data from Michigan--a state that participated in drug-testing for welfare recipients until a federal court held in 2003 that subjecting every applicant to a drug test without reason was unconstitutional. In Michigan, 10 percent of recipients tested positive for illicit drugs. That's comparable to the National Survey on Drug Use & Health, which found that in 2007-08, 8.95 percent of all Michigan residents (grouping non-welfare and welfare recipients) said they used illicit drugs in the past month.

Our ruling

Deshotel said there is ""no evidence that poor people abuse drugs more frequently than any other socio-economic group.""

We agree with PolitiFact Florida that it's difficult to make broad generalizations about whole groups of people. And it's even more difficult to definitively measure drug use. Some research indicates drug abuse among the poor and those who are not poor is consistent. However, there also are studies showing a higher prevalence of drug use among some welfare recipients.

So, evidence is debated. Still, the idea that there is no evidence that low-income people use drugs more frequently does not hold up. As Pollack told us, that's an oversimplification",False,"November 26, 2012"
"Decriminalizing marijuana ""will save the state anywhere from $4 (million) to $11 million dollars.""","On June 13, 2012, Governor Lincoln Chafee signed into law legislation that decriminalizes possession of small amounts of marijuana. As of April 1, 2013, having 1 ounce or less will be a civil offense, punishable by a $150 fine.

Rep. John Edwards, D-Tiverton, was the bill’s prime sponsor as it moved through the Assembly for the third consecutive year.

During a June 5 House debate, he told the story of how, as a construction manager, he employed two skilled carpenters in their 50s who were barred from working on federal projects because ""they had a stupid arrest when they were young for simple possession"" of marijuana.

Most people don’t go to prison for having a small amount of marijuana, Edwards said, ""but they do get arrested and the arrest never goes away."" Not only would his bill curtail those arrests, said Edwards, ""it will save the state anywhere from $4 (million) to $11 million dollars and it will also allow our police to do what they do best and that’s catch criminals.""

We were curious where Edwards got his cost saving figures; $4 million to $11 million is a pretty wide window. Edwards told us he got his information from Wallace B. Gernt Jr. and Christopher Reilly, the president and vice president respectively of The Bradford Group, the Rhode Island public relations firm. One of its clients is the Marijuana Policy Project, a Washington, D.C., group trying to change marijuana laws around the country.

The facts

When we contacted Reilly, he acknowledged a certain haziness hovering over the figures: ""There’s a lot of different thoughts of where those numbers come from.""

Ah, OK.

Then he sent us two reports and had the Marijuana Policy Project forward a memo that a Harvard University economist sent Rhode Island lawmakers earlier this year.

One report was from the Special Senate Commission to Study the Prohibition of Marijuana, issued in March 2010. It notes that in 2009, Rhode Island police made 2,546 arrests for marijuana possession, first offense. (It doesn’t say how much pot each suspect had.)

But the report does not say how much money Rhode Island could save by decriminalizing marijuana.  It defines the savings only as ""significant"".

The second report was ""The Criminal Justice Costs of Marijuana Prohibition in Rhode Island,"" issued in 2010 by the Rhode Island nonprofit group OpenDoors, which helps people released from prison. That report, supported by the Marijuana Policy Project, says Rhode Island stands to save a whopping $12.7 million a year by decriminalizing possession of an ounce or less of marijuana.

We contacted the main author of that report, Nick Horton, who told us that most of the purported savings -- $11.2 million -- wasn’t calculated by OpenDoors at all. ""That figure is not mine,"" said Horton.

It turns out that number came from Jeffrey Miron, the Harvard economist, and his 2010 report that studied how much money the United States would save if it legalized all drugs.

In his one-page memo to Rhode Island lawmakers this spring, Miron provided the general equation he used to reach his $11.2 million figure but never plugged in any actual numbers:  ""I guess when you are a Harvard professor, you no longer have to ""show your work,’’ Robert Capecchi, a legislative analyst for the Marijuana Policy Project, wrote in an email when Politifact asked for the details.

When we called Miron, he said his estimate -- which related exclusively to police enforcement savings -- came from a 2010 report he did for the libertarian Cato Institute: The Budgetary Impact of Ending Drug Prohibition. The study found that by legalizing all drugs, the United States could save $41.3 billion a year.

The study includes a state by state analysis of drug arrests that Miron used. For instance, 2007 data from the FBI’s annual Uniform Crime Reports shows that in Rhode Island that year the police made 26,966 drug arrests. Of those, 1,922 were for marijuana possession. (Again, the data don’t say how much marijuana each suspect had.)

By dividing 1,922 by 26,966, Miron determined that 7 percent of all arrests that year were for marijuana possession.

He then used other data from state government and the U.S. census -- some coming from 2008 -- to conclude that the total police expenditure in Rhode Island was $287 million. Seven percent of that is $20.1 million.

Then he estimated that half of the marijuana arrests were incidental to other more serious charges. Kicking those out, he calculated the annual police savings would be $10.5 million.

That’s not the $11.2 million cited by OpenDoors, but Miron says the $700,000 difference is likely because the data he used was several years old.

In a follow-up conversation, Edwards conceded that he never thought the savings would total the $11 million he cited on the House floor. ""It’s more on the lower end of $4 million,"" he said.

He based that, in part, on some of his own calculations of prison savings -- a point that Miron, the Harvard economist, said he was surprised to hear Edwards talking about because ""almost no one is in prison for [minor] possession.""

But Edwards says he asked Corrections officials for a one-day snapshot of the prison population about a year or so ago. On that day, 42 people were being held for marijuana possession. He multiplied that by the average cost of holding one person at the ACI for a year ($44,000) and came up with a quick $1.8 million savings.

Corrections Department officials told us Edwards’ methodology is wrong because those inmates are scattered among many different units, so their absence would not lead to any staff reductions. They did say there would be some savings by having those 42 beds empty -- about $154,602.

That’s a long way from $1.8 million, let alone $4 million to $11 million.

Our ruling

State Rep. John Edwards was specific in his claim that decriminalizing marijuana will ""save the state anywhere from $4 (million) to $11 million dollars.""

Edwards later backed away from the $11 million figure.

The bill passed with overwhelming support. On March 27, Gov. Nathan Deal signed it into law.

A press release warned of synthetic marijuana’s dangers:

""As the usage has dramatically increased, instances of violence, bodily harm and even death have risen with it,"" it said.

We’ve heard that the drug is nasty stuff. But what’s this about violence, bodily harm and death?

A Deal spokeswoman sent PolitiFact Georgia news stories and poison control data to prove the governor’s point. We also talked to researchers and law enforcement officials and reviewed news stories and scientific studies.

The form of synthetic marijuana that’s sparking so much concern is sold at head shops and gas stations under brand names such as ""Spice"" and ""K2.""  

Georgia made it a felony to manufacture and sell it in 2010. Chase’s Law tries to keep underground chemists from tweaking their recipes to get around state restrictions.  

There’s little scholarly research on the drug, which appears to be new to the U.S.

Federal labs first detected these drugs in November 2008, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. The earliest U.S. news story we found about its rising popularity appeared in a Hutchinson  Kan., newspaper in November 2009.

All signs suggest that synthetic marijuana use is increasing dramatically, but data is in short supply.

Workers at the American Association of Poison Control Centers began tracking synthetic marijuana calls in 2010 after they noticed more inquiries, a spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia.

In 2010, they received 2,906  calls; in 2011, there were 6,959.

About 11 percent of high school seniors reported using synthetic marijuana in the past year, according to 2011 results of an annual survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. It was the first time researchers asked about the drug.

Existing data support Deal’s claim that reports of bodily harm have climbed. Georgia Poison Center call data show 10 users were admitted to a hospital’s critical care unit in 2010 after using the drug. Forty-five were admitted in 2011.

Rapid heartbeat, agitation, drowsiness, vomiting, hallucinations and nausea were among the drug’s most common effects, researchers have found.  

Media accounts report drug users injured in car crashes, falls and other accidents -- some fatal.

Whether synthetic marijuana is directly responsible for deaths -- and whether they’re increasing -- is a more complicated issue. We found no published studies on the drug’s lethality, but there have been ""scattered reports of deaths,"" said Lloyd Johnston, a University of Michigan professor who conducted the National Institute on Drug Abuse survey.

A count of news stories suggests there are more deadly cases. But whether the drug is a direct cause or contributing factor is not clear in some instances.

Consider Burnett’s death. Toxicology tests are still in the works. Whether the official cause of death was drowning, the drug or something else is unsettled.

Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokesman John Bankhead told PolitiFact Georgia of two other recent deaths:  We found other accounts of synthetic marijuana-related deaths. For example, a South Carolina coroner ruled that it was directly responsible for the October death of a college basketball player who collapsed during warm-up, according to multiple news accounts.

PolitiFact Georgia found less support for Deal’s claim about violence. We found no published studies on the subject. News stories, however, suggest there’s cause for concern.

For instance: 
To sum up:

Evidence supports Deal’s claim that use of the drug has ""dramatically increased,"" as has synthetic marijuana-related ""bodily harm."" Some evidence suggests that deaths have risen, too.

The link between the drug and violence is less clear. News accounts suggest there is an increase in both, but we found so few cases it’s hard to tell.

"Says opponent Beto O’Rourke ""wants to legalize drugs.""","A video posted by U.S. Rep. Silvestre Reyes of El Paso opens by showing a silent, grim-faced child. His image is followed by other kids individually saying ""no."" The words flash on screen: ""Beto O'Rourke,"" challenging Reyes in the 2012 Democratic primary, ""wants to legalize drugs."" ""Legalizing drugs is not the answer,"" a narrator says. ""Even our children understand.""

Does O’Rourke, a businessman and former member of the El Paso City Council, want to legalize drugs?

Marijuana, certainly, we learned.

But a news article in the Feb. 28, 2012, El Paso Times quotes O’Rourke saying he has not advocated the wholesale legalization of drugs.

The article quotes Reyes defending his ad by pointing to a book and a 2011 San Antonio Express-News op-ed column that O’Rourke co-wrote with Susie Byrd, a member of the El Paso City Council.

Their Dec. 4, 2011, column says the prohibition of marijuana has resulted in a lucrative but violent marijuana economy entwining Mexico and the United States.

""Mexican drug cartels smuggle many things into the U.S., but marijuana is the most profitable portion of the cartel's portfolio,"" the column says. ""Marijuana has the larger customer base with the most stable demand and steady prices. And, the Mexican cartels own the value of the marijuana from farm to market.""

El Paso, the column continues, ""bears daily witness to the violence that the marijuana economy inflicts on Juarez, our neighbor on the U.S./Mexico border. Since 2008, more than 9,000 people have been murdered in Juarez. The violence stems at least in part from a declared war between the two largest cartels for control of the El Paso/Juarez trade corridor.""

Meanwhile, they write, Americans, including high-school students, continue to use marijuana.

""At some point, we must challenge our elected leaders to enact laws that reflect reality,"" the column says. ""We must come to a reckoning, much the same way we did 80 years ago, and repeal a prohibition that does more harm than good. If Washington won't do anything different, if Mexico City won't do anything different, then it is up to us — the citizens of the border who understand the futility and tragedy of this current policy first hand — to lead the way.""

In December 1933, the federal prohibition of the manufacture, sale and transportation of alcoholic liquors, which had been in place since early 1919, was repealed on ratification of the 21st Amendment to the Constitution. Alcohol consumption had persisted in the intervening years while federal efforts to enforce prohibition cost 150 lives and billions of dollars, according to a December 5, 1933, New York Times report.

We did not track down O’Rourke’s just-published book, ""Dealing Death and Drugs, the Big Business of Dope in the U.S. and Mexico."" But we noticed the subtitle underneath the title on a portion of a Kindle version of the book: ""An Argument to End the Prohibition of Marijuana.""

A Nov. 21, 2011, El Paso Times news article about the book quotes O’Rourke opining on possible benefits from legalizing marijuana: ""We can do a much better job of keeping marijuana out of the hands of kids and keeping marijuana proceeds out of the hands of cartels that use those proceeds to murder, kill and terrorize with impunity, corrupt public officials, recruit people and arm themselves.""

Reyes also has offered as backup for his claim a resolution supported by O’Rourke when he was on the El Paso City Council. According to a news account on newspapertree.com, an online El Paso newspaper, the council in January 2009 unanimously endorsed the resolution, which included language added at O’Rourke’s suggestion urging the federal government to come to the aid of bordering Juarez by ""supporting an honest open national debate on ending the prohibition on narcotics."" The story says Mayor John Cook later vetoed the resolution, saying that as amended, it would not be taken seriously in Washington.

O’Rourke, talking to reporters about the resolution before the veto, said: ""I’m not advocating legalization, but I’m saying that we should at the very least have a conversation about ending prohibition. And that it is looking like one of the more attractive solutions out there right now to an otherwise intractable problem that’s getting worse by the day."" He added that the nation needs to rethink its drug war, which is ""not working.""

After declaring his House candidacy, O’Rourke defended the resolution in what appears to be a classroom speech, according to an undated video of his remarks brought to our attention by Reyes’ campaign. In the recording, O’Rourke recaps his rationale for advocating the resolution and says that he said at the time that ""given what’s going on in Juarez, given what’s at stake, I think that we owe ourselves an honest and open conversation about our drug laws and potentially, potentially, ending the prohibition on these drugs -- namely and most importantly marijuana.""

Reyes’ campaign also pointed out a ""declaration"" presented by O’Rourke and others at the U.S.-Mexico border on May 17, 2010, bemoaning conditions in Juarez and urging ""repeal of the ineffective U.S. marijuana drug laws in favor of regulating, controlling and taxing the production, distribution, sale and consumption of marijuana by adults.""

In a telephone interview, O’Rourke told us that he favors ending the legal prohibition on marijuana but has not been telling voters he will push such a change. He said that is ""not a priority of this community; it doesn’t reflect the desires of people I seek to represent as my constituents.""

Asked why he doesn’t describe himself as favoring legalization of marijuana, O’Rourke replied: ""That word (legalize) is so charged and weighted from years of popular culture references.""

Our ruling O’Rourke favors ending laws against marijuana and has urged a national conversation about legalizing other illegal drugs. But Reyes’ claim leaves the misimpression that O’Rourke favors legalizing all illegal drugs",Half True,"March 7, 2012"
"""Fifty percent of the graduating class of the year 2012 will have smoked marijuana or have done illegal drugs.""","Most Georgians missed it, but there was a presidential debate here after all.

Actually, it was a forum, and the candidates weren’t the Republicans vying for the White House. (CNN canceled a debate set for last Thursday in Atlanta when GOP candidates Mitt Romney and Ron Paul said they had other plans.)

These candidates were Libertarians, five of them, and they answered questions from a moderator for about an hour at their party’s Georgia state convention Feb. 25 in Athens. The Truth-O-Meter started swaying when Gary Johnson, who won a straw poll afterward with 79 percent of the vote, was asked a question about legalizing marijuana.

Johnson, who believes in legalizing marijuana, said an individual’s drug problem should be handled by his or her family -- not the criminal justice system. He then offered this statistic:

""Fifty percent of the [high school] graduating class of the year 2012 will have smoked marijuana or have done some illegal drugs,"" said Johnson, a former two-term governor of New Mexico.

We wondered whether Johnson, who initially tried running as a Republican for president this year, was correct?

For the record, Johnson doesn’t believe teenagers should have access to marijuana. Johnson does believe marijuana is less harmful than alcohol and thinks the money the federal government spends on marijuana enforcement could be better spent ""against the individuals committing real crimes against society.""

The Atlanta-based U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention keeps data on marijuana use. According to the CDC’s most recent data, from 2009, nearly 46 percent of 12th-graders had smoked marijuana at least once. Nearly 51 percent of 12th-grade boys had used marijuana, while the percentage of girls was lower, at just over 40 percent. In Georgia, the percentage of all 12th-graders who tried marijuana at least once was nearly identical to the national average.

The CDC figures showed the following for other illicit drug use by 12th-graders in 2009: 

There was no overall figure for the percentage of 12th-graders who used any illegal drug.

The federal National Institutes of Health has data on its website that says 42 percent of 12th-graders in 2009 had tried marijuana. The percentage had actually declined from nearly 48 percent in 2002. Officials there provided PolitiFact Georgia some data for all types of illicit drug use by 12th-graders.

""In 2011, 50% of high school seniors reported having tried an illicit drug at some time,
40% used one or more drugs in the past 12 months, and 25% used one or more drugs in the prior 30 days,"" Shirley Simson, a media specialist for the NIH’s National Institute on Drug Abuse, told us via email.

Simson said there’s been an increase in the past four years, primarily due to more teenagers smoking marijuana.

The National Center for Education Statistics has data on its website that says about 47 percent of the graduating class of 2009 had tried any type of illicit drug. The percentage has declined each year since 2000, when 54 percent of high school seniors had tried drugs.

We couldn’t find data about the percentage of high school seniors graduating this year who’ve smoked marijuana or have done any kind of illicit drug. The studies we’ve found show drug use among 12th-graders hovers around the 50 percent mark, with a slight decline in recent years",Mostly True,"March 7, 2012"
Federal law prohibits the growing of industrial hemp in the United States.,"In response to a viewer question about marijuana, Democrat Suzanne Bonamici said: ""Industrial hemp is something that right now is used in products and people with businesses right here in Oregon have to buy it from Canada because there’s a federal law that says it can’t be grown.""

We know that industrial hemp has been an issue in the Oregon Legislature. Didn’t the Senate pass something allowing farmers to grow hemp for food, health care products and clothing?

Our hunch was right. In 2009, state lawmakers approved Senate Bill 676, which authorizes farmers to grow hemp, subject to regulation by the Oregon Department of Agriculture. Oregon became the seventh state to do so, joining Maine and Hawaii.

But we can’t grow industrial hemp yet because the federal government has yet to authorize it.

""Until there is some change at the federal level, we are poised to begin the process of establishing rules for production,"" said Bruce Pokarney, spokesman for Oregon’s Agriculture Department.

The federal government does not allow the growing of industrial hemp in the United States",True,"January 14, 2012"
"Says the United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world with 2.3 million inmates, and the majority of Americans are imprisoned because they sold small amounts of drugs.","Presidential candidate Gary Johnson, a longtime advocate of legalizing marijuana, says U.S. prisons are packed with too many small-time drug dealers.

In a meeting with the editorial board of The Telegraph in Nashua, N.H., the former New Mexico governor explained some of the reasoning for his controversial position:

""We now have 2.3 million people behind bars in this country, we have the highest incarceration rate of any country in the world,"" Johnson said. ""The majority of those people behind bars are there because they sold small amounts of drugs.""

We'll examine his claim in two parts: Is the U.S. really a global leader in incarcerating citizens? And are small amounts of drugs such as marijuana really to blame?

Johnson’s New Hampshire Communications Director Matt Simon pointed us to some sources behind Johnson’s claim, citing data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics and World Prison Brief, a publication of the International Centre for Prison Studies at the King's College School of Law in London.

We checked the Bureau of Justice Statistics figures and confirmed there were 2.3 million prisoners in local jails and state and federal prisons at the end of 2009.

The World Prison Brief lists prison population rates per 100,000 residents of each country.

The U.S. tops the list with 743 prisoners per 100,000 residents, followed by Rwanda with 595, the Russian Federation with 559, Georgia with 547 and the Virgin Islands (USA) with 539.

So Johnson is right with the first part of his claim about the total and the top ranking.

But do small-time drug dealers make up the majority of U.S. prisoners?

It depends whether you consider local, state or federal inmates, according to Tracy Snell, a statistician with the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics.

The Bureau of Justice Statistics only investigates information regarding offense types every 5-7 years through inmate surveys, Snell said. So we had to go back to 2002 and 2004 for the most recent data that included the three levels of incarceration to determine what percentage of inmates were held for selling drugs.

The data reveal:

* Local level: 12.1 percent, which is far short of a majority.
* State level: 14.6 percent, also far short of a majority.
* Federal level: 50 percent.

Because the overwhelming majority of all prisoners are held at the state and local level, the number imprisoned for drug offenses is significantly short of a majority. Also, those numbers include all drug sales under the category drug trafficking. The percentages would likely be even smaller if they were limited to sales of small amounts of drugs the way Johnson suggested.

In our correspondence with Johnson’s campaign, Communications Director Simon admitted the error.

""After communicating with a few experts, I can now confirm that the third claim is inaccurate,"" Simon said. ""I believe the real number of those incarcerated for all drug-related crimes is closer to 25 percent of the overall population of incarcerated persons.

""Johnson may have been thinking specifically of the federal inmate population when he made the statement, and although there's difficulty in defining ‘small amounts,’ the statement is closer to being true if applied to inmates in federal prisons.""

Gov. Johnson also admitted his need to clarify, Simon said.

""I just spoke with Gov. Johnson about his error and he said, ’I stand corrected, thanks!’ so I'm sure he won't repeat this claim,"" Simon said.

So Johnson was correct to say that the U.S. has highest incarceration rate in the world, with an estimated total of 2.3 million inmates,but he was wrong that the majority of those imprisoned are being held for selling small amounts of drugs",Half True,"September 22, 2011"
"""The studies have shown us that [drug testing for welfare recipients] will be saving us money""","Rep. Doreen Costa, of North Kingstown, a Republican and member of the Rhode Island Tea Party, thinks the state could save money by requiring welfare recipients to pass a drug test. She is proposing that Rhode Island adopt a law modeled after one enacted in Florida,  which took effect July 1.

The law bans recipients who fail a drug test (and a confirmatory test) from receiving cash assistance for a year, unless they successfully complete substance abuse treatment at their own expense. If they complete treatment, they can reapply after six months. If they reapply and fail another drug test, they are banned for three years.

The child of someone who fails the test will continue to receive money if the parent designates a family member, such as a grandparent, to handle the  funds or if the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) designates a ""protective payee."" The selected family member must also pass a drug test and be approved by DCF.

Recipients would not be tested for alcohol or tobacco use.

Costa said the test would cost $25 to $35 per person and recipients would have to pay for it up front. The state would reimburse them if they passed.

""The studies have shown us that it will be saving us money, but we don't have the exact amount,"" Costa said on WHJJ's Helen Glover Show. ""If we could save the state $10,000, I'll take it. If we could save them a million, I'll take it. We have to start somewhere.""

We're not going to examine whether drug screening is a good idea. But we were intrigued by the question of whether there are studies showing that it would save money.

For this item, we will look at the prospect of savings in Rhode Island, because Costa told us that’s what she was talking about at the time.

We will also examine what studies in other states have concluded when legislators have considered drug-testing their recipients on welfare, formally known as the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program (TANF).

The short answer for Rhode Island is that, under the current system, no state money would be saved because ""100 percent of the cash given to TANF recipients is federal money,"" said Fred Sneesby, spokesman for the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training.

Under current law, the federal government doesn't allow Rhode Island to keep any money it saves by denying benefits to people who test positive for drugs, Sneesby said.

Nor will the federal government pay for such testing.

How much would testing cost the state? We did a back-of-the-envelope calculation based on data supplied by The Rhode Island Poverty Institute.

As of May 2011, there were 5,653 adults receiving TANF benefits, including 1,314 from two-parent families and the rest from single-parent families. The cost to the state would depend, in part, on how many people passed, because only those who failed would end up paying for their test. The state would pay for the rest.

When Michigan briefly did drug testing for welfare recipients (more about that state's experience later), about 92 percent passed, in part because they knew the test was coming.

If Rhode Island recipients passed at the same rate and testing cost $25 to $35 per person, as Costa suggested, that would result in a bill of $130,000 to $182,000 per year.

That doesn't include the continuing cost of testing new applicants, doing confirmatory tests to make sure the first test isn't a false positive and any administrative appeals filed by people who wanted to challenge any move to reduce their welfare checks.

So what about the studies that, Costa claimed, showed costs savings in other states?

When we asked her to pinpoint them, she couldn't cite any. She said she had done her research by going on Ask.com and Google.com and posing the question, ""Will drug-testing welfare recipients save money?""

We repeated that exercise. Our spot check showed that the top results consisted mostly of blog items, websites and news stories in which various politicians and commentators had asserted -- without real evidence -- that drug screening would save money.

However, we did find some studies, but they didn’t support her contention.

A 2009 analysis of a proposed drug testing law by Louisiana's Legislative Fiscal Office concluded that testing would save the state $480,373 in denied benefits while costing the state $184,114 for testing and $763,306 for treatment -- a net loss of $467,047.

If you strip out the treatment costs -- because Costa's proposal calls for people to pay for their own substance abuse treatment -- the net savings to the Louisiana taxpayer would be $296,259.

But Louisiana fiscal analyst Patrice Thomas told us that those calculations were prepared before the state was informed that the federal government would not pay for any of the testing and would not allow the state to keep all of the savings if people were denied benefits. Analyses of bills submitted in 2010 and 2011 showed the drug testing would be a money-loser for the state.

The most recent study we found was done in February 2011 by Idaho's Department of Health and Welfare. It estimated that 10 percent of welfare recipients would test positive for drugs and that 25 percent of that group would lose benefits after failing a confirmatory test, saving $1.13 million per year.

Idaho also assumed that the state would get to keep $67,905 of the savings. But those savings would be wiped out by the cost of the testing, estimated at $246,591.

Thus, for every dollar the state spends in testing, it would get back only 28 cents.

In January 2011, Indiana's Office of Fiscal and Management Analysis released an assessment of a drug testing proposal making the rounds in its legislature. It concluded the state would save between $57,000 and $87,000.

But that analysis didn't include any administrative costs. (Idaho estimated that for every dollar spent on drug-test costs, the state would need to spend $3.41 on various staff costs.) Even if you assumed that Indiana's extra administrative costs were the same as its testing costs -- $173,000 per year -- that would easily wipe out the savings to the state.

Florida isn't the first state to pass a drug testing law for welfare recipients. Michigan adopted one in 1999 but it was put on hold after five weeks because of a court challenge.

(About 8 percent of the 268 applicants tested during those five weeks scored positive for illicit drugs. Most had been using marijuana; fewer than 3 percent were found to be using harder drugs.)

The law was struck down in 2003 by the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals,  which ruled that drug testing without probable cause was ruled to be unconstitutional.

A similar challenge has been predicted for the Florida law.

Arizona does drug testing, but only for people who admit on a written screening test that they have used drugs in the past, gotten into legal trouble because of drugs, or lost or been denied a job because of drugs.

That screening test, derided by advocates of chemical testing because it's easy for people to lie, gives the state probable cause to test for drugs, avoiding the constitutional issue. (Among the people who flunked the screening test, 12.5 percent ultimately tested positive for illegal drugs.)

Minnesota and Wisconsin do drug testing, but only of convicted drug felons.

The Florida law, and the one Costa would like to see passed in Rhode Island, does not call for written screening.

To sum up: Costa, when asked about her proposal to test welfare recipients for drugs, didn't predict specific savings for Rhode Island, only that ""The studies have shown us that it will be saving us money.""

But she was unable to produce any studies to back up that claim.

The ones we found showed that the costs to the state exceed any savings.

And Rhode Island can't save money by kicking people off the welfare rolls because federal funds finance the payments, and the federal government does not allow states to keep money saved through mandatory drug testing",False,"August 26, 2011"
"""Certainly we're going to be the most restrictive state in the land … in terms of who can get medical marijuana, how it will be prescribed and how it will be achieved in terms of moving it into the marketplace.""","More than a year and a half after it was enacted, New Jersey is implementing its medical marijuana law.

State Sen. Nicholas Scutari, a primary sponsor of the law, said he’s glad Gov. Chris Christie decided to move forward with the program -- which, he said, is the most restrictive in the country by three measures.

""Certainly we're going to be the most restrictive state in the land … in terms of who can get medical marijuana, how it will be prescribed and how it will be achieved in terms of moving it into the marketplace,"" Scutari (D-Union) said during a July 27 NJToday interview.  

Is New Jersey really the most restrictive in those three categories?

Most of the experts we spoke with said New Jersey definitely has one of the most -- if not the most -- restrictive medical marijuana programs overall.

Within Scutari’s three parameters, we found the state senator’s statement sound.

Washington, D.C., and 16 states have medical marijuana laws. Maryland has a law, but it only allows medicinal marijuana use as a legal defense, so we aren’t considering it. The District of Columbia isn’t a state -- and Scutari said ""most restrictive state."" So, while we’ll look at Washington, D.C.’s program, it won’t factor into our final ruling.

We’ll compare New Jersey with other programs by Scutari’s three measures -- who’s eligible to get medical marijuana, how medical marijuana is recommended and how a patient actually gets it.

We should note that medical marijuana technically can’t be prescribed, but doctors can recommend it for patients.

Every state describes certain medical conditions or treatments that qualify a patient to receive medical marijuana.

New Jersey’s list of conditions is consistent with other states in some instances -- but of the 17 laws we are considering, only two -- New Jersey and Washington, D.C. -- don’t have a provision for chronic pain, according to a breakdown of medical marijuana laws by the Washington, D.C.-based Marijuana Policy Project, which supports the legalization of marijuana.

Tamar Todd, a staff attorney for Drug Policy Alliance, a drug policy reform organization, said while ""pain is one of the categories where it is most needed,"" it also is ""the category that allows the most abuse.""

The only mention of pain in New Jersey’s law states that a patient with cancer or AIDS or who is HIV positive, qualifies for medical marijuana ""if severe or chronic pain, severe nausea or vomiting, cachexia, or wasting syndrome results from the condition or treatment thereof.""

""[New Jersey’s law] avoids some of the big loopholes that exist in some other states’ laws,"" like California and Colorado, said Jonathan Caulkins, professor of operations research and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University.

Between New Jersey and Washington, D.C., the nation’s capital has the more restrictive list of conditions, said Karen O’Keefe, director of state policies at the Marijuana Policy Project, though D.C.’s law also includes some medical treatments that New Jersey does not.

New Jersey, like most other states and Washington, D.C., allows other medical conditions to be added to the program.

Now, let’s look at how a doctor can recommend medical marijuana for a patient and how a patient can get medical marijuana.

New Jersey lists several requirements a physician must meet in order to be eligible to recommend medical marijuana. One example is a provision requiring doctors to register with the state health department. New Jersey’s medical marijuana program is the only one in the country with that mandate, O’Keefe said.

Once a doctor recommends in writing medical marijuana for someone in New Jersey, the patient or a caregiver must go to one of six dispensaries -- what the state calls ""alternative treatment centers."" There is no provision allowing patients to grow marijuana at home in New Jersey, and patients can get a maximum amount of two ounces per month. Delaware -- which allows up to six ounces --  and D.C. -- which allows up to two ounces --  are the only other medical marijuana programs that don’t have a grow-at-home provision.

O’Keefe said, ""If you are talking about restrictive, I think it’s reasonable to say that having dispensaries only is more restrictive,""  because marijuana is being grown in a controlled setting, rather than in private homes.

The ruling

Scutari said New Jersey will be the most restrictive state in the nation for medical marijuana because of who can get it, how a doctor can recommend it and how it is distributed.

Most experts we spoke with agreed New Jersey is one of the most restrictive states for medical marijuana overall. But by Scutari’s three measures, PolitiFact New Jersey found that the Garden State is generally the most restrictive",True,"August 14, 2011"
"""Studies show that people that are on welfare are higher users of drugs than people not on welfare.""","Florida Gov. Rick Scott is defending his decision to sign a bill into law requiring drug tests for potential cash welfare recipients by saying that people who get welfare are more likely to be on drugs.

During an appearance on CNN on June 5, 2011, Scott was asked what evidence he had that people receiving welfare assistance in Florida are using drugs.

""Studies show that people that are on welfare are higher users of drugs than people not on welfare,"" Scott said. He started to continue his thought -- but was cut off by host T.J. Holmes. (You can watch the entire exchange by clicking here.)

""Sir, to that point ... that would stop people in their tracks. And I don't have whatever study you are referring to, but you're saying that people out there who need this assistance, lost jobs, are on welfare, have a higher tendency to use drugs,"" Holmes said.

""Absolutely,"" Scott responded. ""Studies show that people on welfare are using drugs much higher than other people in the population. But the bottom line is, if they're not using drugs, it's not an issue. Our taxpayers don't want to subsidize somebody's drug addiction. It's going to increase personal responsibility. It's the right thing to do for Floridians.""

Are cash welfare recipients more likely to be drug users than other Floridians?

Details about the drug-testing law

Scott had run for office promising a drug-testing requirement, and he worked to broaden the original drug-testing bill that would have applied only to recent drug felons. The final bill, HB 353, which Scott signed on May 31, forces all people who receive welfare cash -- called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families -- to pass a drug test in order to be eligible for the funds. If prospective recipients fail a first test, they would lose benefits for one year. A second positive drug test would make them ineligible for three years.

About 233,000 Floridians applied for cash assistance in 2009-10, according to statistics kept by the Department of Children and Families. During May 2011, 93,170 Floridians received cash assistance, a drop of 8.3 percent from a year ago. Payments can range from $100 to $200 a month per person.

Under the law -- which takes effect July 1 -- welfare applicants would have to pay for the test. If they pass, the state would reimburse them for the cost, which can range from $10 to $25.

Florida has tried to initiate drug testing before. The Legislature in 1998 approved a drug-testing pilot project for people receiving temporary cash assistance. But the results were underwhelming. Of the 8,797 applicants screened for drugs, only 335 (3.8 percent) showed evidence of having a controlled substance in their systems and failed the test, the Orlando Sentinel reported. The pilot project cost the state $2.7 million (or about $90 a test).

The Legislature ultimately abandoned the program.

Scott's case: Welfare recipients and drug use

Scott spokesman Lane Wright provided PolitiFact Florida with government and academic research that suggests people receiving government assistance are more likely to use illicit drugs than people who are not. The government analysis comes from the Department of Health and Human Services, which -- through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Agency -- conducts an annual National Survey on Drug Use & Health. (A lot of long names, sorry.) The survey has been conducted since 1971. Surveyors administer questions through face-to-face interviews at the subject's home. Results are based on tens of thousands of responses.

Government researchers used the 1999 and 2000 surveys to publish a report titled ""Substance Use Among Persons in Families Receiving Government Assistance.""

Among the findings, researchers concluded that ""past-month illicit drug use was higher in assisted families than in unassisted families among persons aged 12 to 64.""

Specifically, the report found that 9.6 percent of people in families receiving some type of government assistance reported recent drug use, compared to 6.8 percent among people in families receiving no government assistance at all. The government research, we should note, extends beyond the scope of what Scott is talking about -- cash payments through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program -- and includes families receiving food stamps, non-cash assistance through housing assistance or child care, and people receiving Medicaid.

It also is 11 years old.

But it does provide at least some grounding for Scott's claim.

We asked Bradford Stone, a government spokesman for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Agency, if researchers have used more recent survey data to complete the same analysis regarding drug use and welfare assistance. Stone said researchers have not.

The second report is from Harold Pollack, a professor at the University of Chicago who studies substance abuse among welfare recipients, and Lisa Metsch, a professor at the University of Miami.

The 2009 report, ""Substance Use Among Welfare Recipients: Trends and Policy Responses,"" concluded that ""substance abuse and dependence are relatively uncommon"" for people receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families dollars. Yet the same research found -- by reviewing many different surveys -- that ""approximately 20 percent of TANF recipients report that they have used an illicit drug at least once in the past year.""

In an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Pollack said that his research helps support Scott's claim -- but it also doesn't.

""It is true that compared to other women of the same age, TANF recipients are more likely to use illicit substances,"" Pollack said. ""That's a fact.

""On the other hand, there are a couple of major caveats,"" Pollack added.

Pollack said that most women who have used an illicit drug in the past year do not meet the diagnosis of being dependent on drugs, or abusing drugs. A lot of casual marijuana users may well test positive, Pollack said, but they do not have a ""drug problem.""

Nor are they feeding a habit with welfare dollars, Pollack said.

The other case: Welfare recipients and drug use

The American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes the drug-testing requirement, offered other government and academic research to consider.

Researchers at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, a part of the National Institutes of Health, published findings in 1996 that said welfare recipients ""using, abusing, or dependent on alcohol or illicit drugs are consistent with proportions of both the adult U.S. population and adults who do not receive welfare.""

The research relied on 1992 data and concluded that drug use among welfare recipients ranged between 1.3 to 3.6 percent, compared to 1.5 percent for non-welfare recipients.

The caveats here are much like the government research Scott provided. Namely, it includes other types of welfare than cash assistance, and it's old. The report was published in 1996, and relies on 1992 data.

Another researcher used data from Michigan -- a state that participated in drug-testing for welfare recipients until the program was ruled unconstitutional. In Michigan, 10 percent of recipients tested positive for illicit drugs. That's comparable to The National Survey on Drug Use & Health, which found that in 2007-08, 8.95 percent of all Michigan residents (grouping non-welfare and welfare recipients) said they used illicit drugs in the last month.

Lastly, the ACLU highlighted the work of professors Robert Crew Jr. and Belinda Creel Davis, who studied Florida's attempt to drug test welfare recipients.

In two research papers, ""Substance Abuse as a Barrier to Employment of Welfare Recipients"" and ""Assessing the Effects of Substance Abuse Among Applicants for TANF Benefits: The Outcome of a Demonstration Project in Florida,"" Crew and Davis assessed the results of the Florida program.

They found that only 5 percent of welfare recipients showed evidence of drug abuse. But, Crew and Davis noted, the number is low in comparison to other data and raises ""some questions about the procedures employed by the state.""

Yet, Crew and Davis also concluded: ""The evidence from Florida suggests that the concern on the part of both citizens and public officials about substance abuse among welfare recipients may be unwarranted. Evidence from previous research on the welfare population in Florida shows that controlled substances are low (about 5 percent) when measured by a urine test.""

The study also concluded that welfare recipients who do use drugs are able to compete for jobs just like middle- and upper-class drug users -- meaning drug use isn't creating their reliance on welfare.

But Crew, who teaches at Florida State University, told us that his research didn't try to compare drug use among TANF recipients and non-TANF recipients.

""We didn't try to compare that population in Florida,"" he said. ""I don't know how to do that.""

Crew said his research had two major conclusions -- which we previously noted. The percentage of welfare recipients who used drugs in Florida was ""pretty small,"" and in terms of those recipients finding work, ""it didn't make much difference whether they used drugs or not.""

Our ruling

Let's remember what Scott said. He told CNN's T.J. Holmes that, ""Studies show that people that are on welfare are higher users of drugs than people not on welfare.""

Scott's office provided evidence that supports that claim. Sort of.

And opponents provided evidence that refutes Scott's claim. Sort of.

What's obvious is that it's difficult to make broad generalizations about a whole group of people. And it's even more difficult to definitively measure drug use. Scott's statement is at least partially accurate because there are studies showing a higher prevalence of drug use among some welfare recipients. But he also is neglecting research that suggests that drug use among welfare and non-welfare recipients is consistent",Half True,"June 9, 2011"
"""Rhode Island continues to have the highest rates of substance abuse in the country.""","When state lawmakers this year took up legislation to create a high school program in Rhode Island for teens in recovery, they heard sobering testimony from the head of the agency that would run it.

Ian Lang, chief strategy officer of The Providence Center, a provider of mental-health and substance-abuse services, painted a disturbing portrait of addiction problems in Rhode Island.

""Rhode Island continues to have the highest rates of substance abuse in the country,"" he told members of the Senate Education Committee while describing plans to locate the small school in one wing of the center’s building on Hope Street.

Do we really have such a serious substance abuse problem?

In his remarks, Lang cited statistics from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Its sponsor, the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, says the survey  ""is the primary source of statistical information on the use of illegal drugs, alcohol, and tobacco by the U.S. civilian, non-institutionalized population aged 12 or older.""

The survey, begun in 1971, is conducted in door-to-door interviews with a representative sample of the nation’s population. About 900 people in Rhode Island respond annually to the questionnaire, parts of which are administered confidentially with computers.

Lang, citing survey estimates, testified that ""over 11 percent of Rhode Islanders 12 and over use illicit drugs, the highest rate in the nation, and that Rhode Island has the highest percentage of persons 12 years and over needing but not receiving treatment for illicit drug use, at 3.3 percent. We also have the lowest perceived risk of substance abuse in the country, according to national statistics.""

When we contacted Lang to discuss the survey results, he did some checking and realized he had actually cited old data. The most recent state-by-state comparison is based  on the 2007-2008 surveys. (The federal agency is a couple years behind and will release 2009 data later this year, a spokeswoman said.) Still, Lang said, Rhode Island continues to have among the worst substance-abuse rates in the nation.

""I think a lot of it has to do with the location... between Boston and New York and the easy availability of  drugs and the urban environment  we live in,"" he said. ""It’s a lot easier to get around here than if you were in the middle of nowhere....If you look at our sister states, it’s not just a problem in Rhode Island, it’s a problem in the Northeast,"" Lang said.

We decided to check the survey results ourselves. They turned out to be far more complex than we imagined. And troubling.

To begin with, states are not ranked individually. Instead, they are grouped into one of five ""quintiles."" So when Lang says Rhode Island’s rates are the ""highest"" in the nation, he’s using the survey definition, which is falling among the 10 worst states in any particular category.

We found that Rhode Island not only landed among the worst states in one category Lang cited -- the percentage of those 12 and over who have used illicit drugs in the past month -- we actually had the highest individual score. Rhode Island’s rate was 13.3 percent. (Oregon was second, at 12.1 percent.)

We wondered why Lang would select everyone 12 and over instead of focusing on the population that would be served by the recovery high school. The survey, after all, includes a category for youths ages 12 to 17. So how does Rhode Island rank in that category? Still in the highest fifth and, according to our review, second of all states, at 12.4 percent. (Vermont is highest, at 13 percent.)

Lang also cited survey estimates of how many people in Rhode Island need treatment for substance abuse, but aren’t getting it. For ages 12 and up, Rhode Island was in the ""highest"" group (ranking second at 3.9 percent). Again, we checked the rate for those ages 12 to 17, and the state remained in the top fifth, in sixth place at 4.9 percent.

Lang also highlighted the study’s examination of attitudes in Rhode Island toward drug use, namely whether people  consider monthly marijuana use and weekly binge drinking to be risky. The numbers generally indicate our state is more accepting than others of such behavior.

We decided to look into two areas of the survey that Lang didn’t mention, and turned up more troubling statistics. Turns out that Rhode Island topped all states for marijuana use for all age groups: an estimated 10.9 percent of residents 12 and older had used marijuana in the month prior to the survey. It also was tops for alcohol consumption by youth, including binge drinking.

Finally, we wondered whether the National Survey Lang cited is really the most authoritative. We put that question to Robert Morrison, executive director of the National Association of State Alcohol/Drug Abuse Directors.

""The national survey on drug use and health is one of the most widely used surveys in the country to get a picture of substance abuse in the nation,"" he told us.

In summary, the federal study Lang relied upon has a 40-year history and the statistics he cited were accurate. And when we delved into a variety of other categories from the same survey, we found that in many instances, Rhode Island has the ""highest rates of substance abuse in the country"" -- an alarming distinction",True,"June 9, 2011"
"""We have seized more currency, more drugs, more outbound arms in the past year than any year in our country’s history.""","As members of the Obama administration push for immigration reform, they’re casting themselves as border security hawks.

President Barack Obama said he has ""gone above and beyond"" what Republicans requested for border patrol.

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, a former governor of Arizona, was even more emphatic during a May talk at the Atlanta Press Club. She said ""there has never been a larger, more sustained and better effort"" on the border than today.

""We have seized more currency, more drugs, more outbound arms in the past year than any year in our country’s history,""  Napolitano said.

Has the country’s haul of contraband really reached such historic highs?

We asked the Department of Homeland Security for proof. It gave us statistics for seizures by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Immigration Customs Enforcement that compared two-and-a-half years under Obama and the last two-and-a-half years under President George W. Bush.

According to the data for the U.S.-Mexico border:

* Illegal currency seizures grew by about 75 percent from $124.5 million to $218.7 million.
* Illegal drug seizures grew 31 percent, from 3.2 million kilos to 4.2 million kilos.
* Illegal weapons seizures grew 64 percent from about 3,100 to 5,200.

We asked for more data, but despite more than two weeks of requests, DHS did not give us additional information. So we turned to other sources.

In October 2010, the Government Accountability Office, the nonpartisan investigative arm of the U.S. Congress, issued a report on the federal government’s effort to stop cross-border currency smuggling. Data show that cash seizures jumped after the March 2009 start of a program to boost seizures of outbound money and drugs.

During the first year of that program, Customs and Border Protection seized about $34 million heading out of the country on land, overwhelmingly from the southwest border. The agency seized $16.8 million in the year leading up to it.

The cash seizures, however, varied widely from about $1 million to $8 million per month and likely account for only a fraction of the money that crosses the borders. An estimated $18 billion to $39 billion is smuggled out of the southwest border each year, according to the GAO report.

Marijuana drug seizures increased almost 50 percent from 1.6 million pounds in fiscal year 2008 to 2.4 million pounds in fiscal year 2010, according to a separate March 2011 GAO report. We were unable to find similar firearms figures.  

Further complicating the issue is that as of fiscal year 2011, Customs and Border Protection no longer reports data on its success detecting contraband, according to the March 2011 report.

Experts on counternarcotics told us they have no reason to doubt Napolitano’s claim. In recent years, the DHS has doubled the number of border patrol agents, installed technology that makes it easier to detect contraband and paid more attention to coordinating their efforts with Mexico.

Improving the border effort, however, did not require an exceptional effort, experts told us.  Previously, there was little emphasis on seizing illegal guns, noted Vanda Felbab-Brown, a fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution.

""Yes, we are capturing more arms than ever because we now try for the first time; the baselines are extremely low,"" Felbab-Brown wrote PolitiFact Georgia in an email.

It’s also important to note that these increases in seizures are not proof DHS’ efforts are successful, said Eric L. Olson, a counternarcotics expert at the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. He said we need to know what percentage of contraband is being captured.  

If DHS drug seizures climbed 10 percent, but 100 percent more drugs are being smuggled across the border, that’s hardly a success.  

""They’re doing more things,"" Olson said of the DHS, ""but whether it is accomplishing anything is another question.""

That’s a question we may be unable to answer, he added. It’s extremely difficult to calculate the total amount of drugs entering the country.

To sum up:

The data DHS gave us is not enough to prove definitively that Napolitano’s claim that the agency has ""seized more currency, more drugs, more outbound arms in the past year than any year in our country’s history.""

We can say that seizures increased recently under the Obama administration, but they were so low in the past that the bump is not a major accomplishment. Also, the seized contraband is likely such a small percentage of what crosses the border that the increase’s impact on the illegal drug trade is slight.

By PolitiFact’s rules, the burden of proof is on the person who makes the claim",Half True,"June 3, 2011"
"""I'm well aware that medical marijuana is a recognized, medical, viable treatment for this sort of [pancreas] pain condition.""","On the night of April 22, 2011, Rep. Robert Watson, R-East Greenwich, was stopped at a Connecticut sobriety checkpoint and ultimately charged with both driving under the influence and marijuana possession.

In a floor speech the following Tuesday, the then-House minority leader said he was not under the influence. He said he had not smoked marijuana, and his blood-alcohol level tested at 0.05, which is below the legal limit of 0.08.

Watson told fellow House members he had ""a very small bag with trace amounts of marijuana and a smoking instrument."" He was carrying the marijuana, he said, in case he had an attack of pancreatitis.

""I'm well aware that medical marijuana is a recognized, medical, viable treatment for this sort of pain condition,"" he said in his speech, which garnered a standing ovation from Republicans and other House members at the time. (But a week later, the Republican caucus ousted him as minority leader.)

Watson, citing personal privacy, has not released details of his medical record; results of his blood test will be the subject of his court hearing in Connecticut. But we wanted to weed out the facts on whether marijuana is actually recognized as a treatment for the pain of pancreatitis, an extraordinarily painful condition that Watson described as akin to a gunshot to the chest.

First, some background.

The pancreas, located behind the stomach, releases enzymes that aid in digestion. It also releases the insulin the body needs to control blood sugar. The enzymes flow out a tube into the small intestine near the stomach.

Unfortunately, a portion of that tube is shared with the gallbladder. Sometimes tiny stones form in the gallbladder, migrate down the tube and block the portion that drains the pancreas. The result is painful inflammation -- pancreatitis.

Doctors can usually see the stones with ultrasound or some other form of imaging. In those cases, either the stone eventually works its way free or doctors remove it. In either case, doctors urge patients to have the gall bladder removed. End of problem.

The second major cause of pancreatitis is alcohol. When that's the case, doctors insist that patients abstain from drinking because one attack can lead to others, damaging the pancreas in a way that leads to chronic pancreatitis.

""The recommendation is pretty much to not take any alcohol because alcohol is a toxin to the pancreas,"" said Dr. Alyn Adrain, a gastroenterologist and clinical assistant professor of medicine at Brown University.

Heavy smoking may also increase the risk, said Dr. Vikesh Singh, director of the Pancreatitis Center at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. That risk can be difficult to tease out because smoking and drinking often go hand in hand.

Pancreatitis can also be caused by inherited deformities in the pancreas. There have also been at least two studies covering four patients suggesting that marijuana, by itself, can cause a pancreatitis attack. In other instances, doctors have trouble pinpointing a cause.

Watson politely declined to answer most questions about his condition, saying he believes his health should be a private matter. Watson did, however, reveal elements of his illness during his speech on the floor of the House.

He said his initial attack of pancreas pain was at Halloween. He said he went to the hospital the next day, where he had a severe reaction to a drug, prompting doctors to put him in a medically induced coma for five days.

He said he subsequently had other attacks. He did not disclose the number and severity.

""I did treat with medical marijuana on one of those rare occasions where I had that debilitating pain that had me flat on my back"" wondering whether to call an ambulance, he said.

He also reported having a recurrence the day before his arrest, but said he did not use marijuana then.

Watson said that when he tried the drug, ""it provided relief and it alleviated the pain . . . I believed it was responsible self-therapy.""

Watson said he had not applied for authorization to use medical marijuana.

But is marijuana ""a recognized, medical, viable treatment for this sort of pain condition,"" as he contends?

As a treatment for pancreatitis pain, let's be blunt. The simple answer is ""No.""

Both Doctors Singh and Adrain said there are no studies in the medical literature showing that marijuana is an effective treatment for the pain of a pancreatitis attack.

""There is no reason to use marijuana for acute pancreatitis,"" said Singh. ""There are no studies evaluating the use of cannabis for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis pain.""

""I've never given it for chronic pain from pancreatitis and I don't know anyone who has,"" said Adrain.

When we contacted Watson, he said his statement should be considered in the context of treatment for severe pain in general. The state's guidelines for medical marijuana use say ""qualifying debilitating medical conditions"" include ""a chronic or debilitating disease or medical condition or its treatment"" that produces any of six conditions, including ""severe, debilitating, chronic pain.""

In that context, the doctors we interviewed said marijuana MIGHT be useful in some cases, just as the drug helps some patients cope with cancer pain.

""It might help. There's just no good evidence to prove it’s worthwhile,"" said Singh.

Finally, we looked to Canada, where the use of medical marijuana has been legal for years.  Health Canada, which authorizes medical marijuana use, lists seven conditions -- multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury or disease, cancer, HIV, epilepsy, severe arthritis -- where the use is routinely accepted. For other conditions, a specialist must confirm ""that conventional treatments have failed or [are] judged inappropriate to relieve symptoms.""

And Dr. Mark Ware, associate medical director of the McGill University Health Centre Pain Clinic in Montreal, told us in an email that pancreatitis is a different kind of pain. ""This is a visceral pain syndrome and most cannabis studies have focused on neuropathic pain."" The personal reports you can find on the web ""have not been validated or evaluated.""

So as far as we could determine, it's neither recognized nor recommended by the medical community for this use. There are certainly no studies to support its use",False,"May 8, 2011"
"Transporting drugs ""is the price of admission"" for people crossing the border illegally.","John Loughlin, a Republican running for Congress in the 1st District, echoed a controversial claim about illegal immigration when he appeared July 9 on WHJJ's Helen Glover Show.

Loughlin, fresh from a trip to Arizona, said that it's common for people crossing the border illegally to be carrying drugs for drug traffickers.

""That's the price of admission,"" Loughlin said. ""So if you want your family to go -- you, your wife, your kids, you know --  'Here's a backpack full of drugs.' That's how you're going to get across the border.""

At another point in the conversation, he said, ""And these are folks that come across the border and in many cases they're human traffickers. And in order to get passage across the border you gotta carry a knapsack full of 80 pounds of drugs. And if you get tired in the middle of the desert, they take the drugs off your back and leave you for dead. They found many of them just left for dead in the middle of the desert.""

Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer made a similar claim June 25, when she asserted that ""The majority of people that are coming to Arizona and trespassing are now becoming drug mules.""

PolitiFact National examined Brewer's claim and, on June 30, judged it as False.

PolitiFact concluded that while most experts agree that there is growing overlap between drug smuggling and human smuggling, the evidence shows that only a small percentage of those crossing the border illegally are carrying drugs.

Even Brewer backed off her initial statement, issuing two clarifications. The second one said, in part: ""The simple truth is that the majority of human smuggling in our state is under the direction of the drug cartels, which are by definition smuggling drugs.""

So, by her logic, if you're being helped by a drug smuggler, you're a drug smuggler, even if you're not carrying drugs.

We alerted Loughlin's campaign to the previous PolitiFact story and asked for the source of the candidate's statements on the Glover show.

Loughlin's campaign manager, Cara Cromwell, responded by noting that Loughlin never specifically said the majority of illegal immigrants were transporting drugs. But his words and the context of his comments clearly gave the impression that carrying drugs is now the price of admission for getting into the United States illegally.

Cromwell also released a statement from the candidate saying that he got his information from law enforcement officials in Arizona, and she gave us a phone number for the Pinal County sheriff's office. ""While the information is anecdotal, it is nevertheless a sad but true fact,"" Loughlin said in the statement.

So we called, and then emailed, the Pinal County sheriff's office and asked how many people they had arrested for crossing the border since Jan. 1, and how many of those had been charged with drug offenses.

Spokesman Tim Gaffney said that from Jan. 1 to May 18, their office turned over 100 people to the U.S. Border Patrol for being in the country illegally, of which 41 were charged with marijuana smuggling. So far so good.

But it turns out that Pinal County is about 70 miles from the border, and those 100 people, said Gaffney, were picked up for a variety of reasons, not as they were crossing the border. ""None of them are from that. They're all just from officer contacts, from citizens calling in the individuals,"" Gaffney said. ""Almost all of them are traffic stops or citizens calling in regarding fights in progress or suspicious behavior where we get called to it.""

He referred us to the U.S. Border Patrol for broader numbers.

We then called Steven Cribby, spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, who pulled statistics for the Tucson sector, which covers 262 miles of Arizona border, from the New Mexico state line to Yuma, Arizona. It's also the biggest and busiest sector.

The 100 people (about 22 per month) picked up in Pinal County turns out to be a drop in the bucket. From Oct. 1, 2008 through Sept. 30, 2009, the border patrol apprehended 241,673 people (20,000 per month), Cribby said.

How many of the 241,673 cases involved drugs? Cribby said the Border Patrol logged 1,602 apprehensions in ""drug-related events"" for that period.

We did the math. That's less than 1 percent (0.66 percent) of all the apprehensions from that Border Patrol sector.

But Cribby stressed that not everyone who is apprehended in a drug-related event is actually involved with drugs. ""It just means they were apprehended in the same event,"" he said.

So the actual percentage could be even lower.

""For the most part, the people who are bringing drugs across, they're getting very heavily coached that as soon as you sense that the Border Patrol is coming to run away as quickly as possible"" back to Mexico, said Tucson sector agent Colleen Agle. ""And a lot of them try to come north with the intention of just hiding the load so that somebody who is already in the United States can come and pick that up. So they're trying to hide it and run back.""

So they're not even interested in staying in the United States.

This seems to confirm what PolitiFact found in June when it received data from the Department of Homeland Security showing that, in March 2010, drug and drug-trafficking charges accounted for just over 5 percent of immigrations and customs prosecutions while simple immigration violations accounted for almost 89 percent.

By saying that carrying drugs has become the price of admission for getting across the Arizona border illegally, Loughlin falsely created the impression that most immigrants sneaking across the border are being forced to pay this price.

After we informed the campaign that the drug mule claim had been questioned (and sent along the June 30 PolitiFact item outlining its problems), Loughlin acknowledged that he was using anecdotal information from the law enforcement people he spoke with, yet still characterized his ""price of admission"" comment as ""a sad but true fact.""

But anecdotes are not the best evidence.

The not-so-anecdotal numbers from Customs and Border Protection show that his fact is sad but not true",False Pants on Fire,"July 20, 2010"
"""The majority of the people that are coming to Arizona and trespassing are now becoming drug mules.""","Arizona Republican Gov. Jan Brewer created a frenzy in April 2010 when she signed a law that makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime and requires legal immigrants to carry papers that confirm their status. Then in late June, she linked illegal immigrants and drug smuggling.

The string of controversial comments began June 15, 2010, during a debate with three other candidates running for the Republican nomination for governor.

Republican candidate Matt Jette said that most people who cross illegally into Arizona are ""just trying to feed their families."" Brewer, according to the Arizona Republic, disputed that, saying, ""They're coming here, and they're bringing drugs. And they're doing drop houses, and they're extorting people and they're terrorizing the families.""

A few days later, on June 25, Brewer expanded upon her comments during a question-and-answer session with reporters. (A verbatim account of the exchange is available here.)

""Well, we all know that the majority of the people that are coming to Arizona and trespassing are now becoming drug mules,"" Brewer said. ""They're coming across our borders in huge numbers. The drug cartels have taken control of the immigration. … So they are criminals. They're breaking the law when they are trespassing and they're criminals when they pack the marijuana and the drugs on their backs.""

Brewer added, ""I believe today and in the circumstances that we are facing, that the majority of the illegal trespassers that are coming in the state of Arizona are under the direction and control of organized drug cartels, and they are bringing drugs in.""

Finally, later the same day, Brewer released a statement clarifying her comments for a second time.

""There has been some media attention in the last several hours regarding statements I made this morning regarding the level of drug and crime activity being perpetrated by illegal immigrants coming into and residing in Arizona. The simple truth is that the majority of human smuggling in our state is under the direction of the drug cartels, which are by definition smuggling drugs,"" the statement said.

""It is common knowledge that Mexican drug cartels have merged human smuggling with drug trafficking. For example, the Los Angeles Times on March 23, 2009, reported, 'The business of smuggling humans across the Mexican border has been brisk, with many thousands coming across every year. But smugglers affiliated with the drug cartels have taken the enterprise to a new level – and made it more violent – by commandeering much of the operation from independent coyotes, according to these officials and recent congressional testimonies.' This article and many federal government reports have drawn the same conclusions.

""The human rights violations that have taken place victimizing immigrants and their families are abhorrent. Border crossers are used by drug cartels as commodities. Mexican drug cartels have merged human smugglers who use their expertise in gathering intelligence on border patrols, logistics and communication devices to get around even tighter controls. U.S. border officials have stated that traffickers are gaining control of much of the illegal passage of immigrants from Mexico to the United States.""

Though Brewer did not use her written statement to retract any of her prior comments, she did change her focus a bit, singling out the criminal elements running joint drug-and-human smuggling operations rather than the immigrants that the cartels have been, in her words, ""victimizing.""

Whether or not this represents a backpedaling, we thought her earlier comments deserve scrutiny because they raise an interesting question -- whether there is a substantial connection between illegal immigrants and drug smuggling. So we talked to experts and looked over statistical data to see whether Brewer was justified in claiming that ""the majority of the people that are coming to Arizona and trespassing are now becoming drug mules.""
 
The governor's staff did not respond to PolitiFact's request for comment, nor did Customs and Border Protection. But most of the experts we spoke to agreed with the notion, raised in the Los Angeles Times article and by Brewer, that there is growing overlap between drug smuggling and human smuggling.

""Because of the militarization of the border and the increased difficulty in crossing, most border-crossers turn to 'coyotes,' "" or human smugglers, said Aarti Kohli, the director of immigration policy and legislative counsel for the Chief Justice Earl Warren Institute on Race, Ethnicity, and Diversity at the University of California (Berkeley) School of Law. ""Sometimes these coyotes have links with drug cartels and are engaging in drug smuggling along with alien smuggling. Both are federal offenses.""

That said, Kohli and others draw a clear distinction with Brewer's suggestion that the majority of illegal border crossers are ""drug mules.""

""If caught along the southwest border, the vast majority of migrants are prosecuted in federal district court, often 70 at a time, for misdemeanor illegal entry,"" Kohli said. ""If they are caught smuggling drugs, they would not be prosecuted"" in this way.

Federal statistics bear this out. We looked at the latest available statistics, covering March 2010, for prosecutions stemming from immigrations and customs activities by the Department of Homeland Security. They show that ""immigration"" charges accounted for almost 89 percent of cases, while drug and drug-trafficking charges accounted for just over 5 percent.

""These apprehensions do not catch everyone, obviously, but as the Border Patrol is particularly interested in interdicting contraband, I don't know of any strong reason to believe that the Border Patrol's arrests would have a disproportionately low share of smugglers,"" said Gabriel ""Jack"" Chin, a professor of law, public administration and policy at the University of Arizona.

The statistics also track with accounts of law enforcement sources.

""Based on conversations with front-line Border Patrol agents, it is clear that the majority of people encountered by the Border Patrol are not carrying drugs,"" said T.J. Bonner, president of the National Border Patrol Council. ""While it is true that the majority of human smuggling is controlled or at least regulated by the cartels, it does not logically follow that the majority of people who are smuggled by the cartels are therefore transporting drugs. The penalties for transporting drugs are far greater than the penalties for entering the country illegally, so people do not engage in that type of criminal behavior unless they are so inclined, are extremely desperate or are coerced by the cartels. The two latter categories are the exceptions rather than the rule.""

On the broader issue, it's worth noting that statistics have consistently shown that immigrants, including illegal immigrants, actually have lower rates of criminal activity and incarceration than do the native-born children of immigrants. Rubén G. Rumbaut, a sociologist at the University of California (Irvine), has written that 2000 Census figures show consistently lower incarceration rates for foreign-born Mexicans, Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Colombians, Ecuadorians and Peruvians when compared to incarceration rates of U.S.-born members of the same ethnic groups. While the category ""foreign-born"" is not identical to ""illegal immigrant,"" there is significant overlap in these particular ethnic groups, Rumbaut writes.

Ultimately, Brewer would have been on safe ground if she'd said that drug smuggling and human smuggling have become increasingly intertwined, and that sometimes, illegal immigrants have been coerced into serving as drug couriers. But that's a much more limited claim than what she initially said -- that ""the majority of the people that are coming to Arizona and trespassing are now becoming drug mules."" While the source she eventually cited -- the Los Angeles Times -- says that ""sometimes (smugglers) loaded up their human cargo with backpacks full of marijuana,"" the article doesn't back up her assertion that that ""the majority"" of illegal immigrants carry drugs into the country. More to the point, Brewer's contention is undercut by both federal prosecution statistics and the accounts of experts we spoke to",False,"June 30, 2010"
"""More people are driving under the influence of drugs than are driving under the influence of alcohol. A recent roadside survey showed that 16 percent of the people tested, tested positive for illicit or licit drugs. That's significantly higher than alcohol.""","Much has been made of the United States' success in reducing the amount of drinking and driving over the past few decades. But is there a growing problem with drivers on drugs?

During a March 31, 2010, interview on C-SPAN’s Washington Journal, Gil Kerlikowske -- the head of the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy, and more commonly known as the drug czar -- seemed to suggest as much.

""More people are driving under the influence of drugs than are driving under the influence of alcohol,"" Kerlikowske said. ""A recent roadside survey showed that 16 percent of the people tested, tested positive for illicit or licit drugs. That's significantly higher than alcohol.""

This surprised us, so we decided to take a closer look.

We located the study that Kerlikowske was referring to -- the National Roadside Survey of Alcohol and Drug Use by Drivers. It was conducted in 2007 for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration -- part of the federal Department of Transportation -- through a contract with the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation. It was the fourth major roadside survey (earlier ones were undertaken in 1973, 1986 and 1996) and was the first to look at drugs as well as alcohol.

The 2007 study randomly stopped drivers at 300 U.S. locations on weekend nights (10 p.m. through midnight on Fridays and Saturdays, and 1 a.m. to 3 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays) and also made some daytime stops for comparisons. Participation in the survey and its testing was voluntary. The stops targeted private vehicles, including motorcycles, but they excluded commercial vehicles such as semitrailer trucks. In all, 11,000 drivers participated, with 86 percent tested by breathalyzer, 71 percent by oral fluid samples and 39 percent by blood samples. (The blood test was for nighttime drivers only.)

Because the nighttime sample provides the most complete data on drug use, we'll stick to the nighttime sample for alcohol use as well.

During the nighttime tests, 2.2 percent of drivers registered a blood-alcohol content of at least .08 percent -- the level at which a driver is presumed impaired under Florida law.

By contrast, a whopping 16.3 percent of drivers tested positive for drugs, defined in the study as ""illegal, prescription, and over-the-counter products, including stimulants, sedatives, antidepressants, marijuana, and narcotic analgesics."" The most commonly detected drugs were marijuana (8.6 percent), cocaine (3.9 percent) and methamphetamine (1.3 percent).

If that were the end of the story, Kerlikowske's comment would be resoundingly accurate -- 16.3 percent is indeed ""significantly higher"" than 2.2 percent.
But there are two caveats that deserve a mention. •  Legal vs. illegal levels of alcohol. The 2.2 percent of drivers registering .08 or above is, by historical standards, impressively low -- that number has steadily declined since the first survey, from 7.5 percent in 1973 to 5.4 percent in 1986 to 4.3 percent in 1996 before dropping to 2.2 percent in 2007.

Still, that number underestimates the total percentage of drivers who registered some alcohol in their bloodstream. In all, the survey found that 12.4 percent of drivers had some alcohol in their bloodstream -- 7.9 percent with levels between .005 and .049 and an additional 2.3 percent with levels between .05 and .079.

Low, but detectible, blood-alcohol levels do not impair a driver as much as illegal levels do, but they can have an effect. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, such symptoms as ""mild euphoria, talkativeness, decreased inhibitions, decreased attention, impaired judgment and increased reaction time"" can begin at .03 percent, and numerous countries have set legal thresholds lower than .08.

Indeed, the California Department of Motor Vehicles says that blood-alcohol content below .08 percent ""does not mean that it is safe or legal to drive."" The state calls levels from .01 to .04 a ""possible DUI"" (driving under the influence) and .05 to .07 a ""likely DUI."" For drivers under 21, both categories are illegal outright.

•  We don't know much about how drugs affect the act of driving. Compared to the effects of alcohol, the impact of drugs on driving is not yet well understood. Some of this has to do with the long head start in research on alcohol and driving, and some has to do with the greater chemical complexity of drugs compared to alcohol.

The authors of the study were open about the limitations of today's knowledge. ""In addition to the prevalence of drug use by drivers,"" they wrote, ""several other questions need to be answered in order to assess the drug-impaired driving problem, including: Which drugs impair driving ability? What drug dose levels are associated with impaired driving? Which drugs are associated with higher crash rates?""

They added a strongly worded caveat. ""The reader is cautioned that drug presence does not necessarily imply impairment,"" they wrote. ""For many drug types, drug presence can be detected long after any impairment that might affect driving has passed. For example, traces of marijuana can be detected in blood samples several weeks after chronic users stop ingestion. Also, whereas the impairment effects for various concentration levels of alcohol are well understood, little evidence is available to link concentrations of other drug types to driver performance.""

To offer a more concrete example, it's unclear how much impact a joint of marijuana inhaled two weeks ago may have on a driver today. It could well be that the two-week-old joint is less of an impairment than a legal level of alcohol in the blood -- even though the study would count the marijuana user as part of that 16 percent ""under the influence of drugs"" yet exclude someone with .07 percent alcohol from the 2.2 percent of alcohol-impaired drivers.

Thomas McLellan, deputy director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, told PolitiFact that the sensitivity of the oral swabs makes it ""highly unlikely"" that marijuana use ""even half a day earlier would have shown up"" in the survey. Still, in addition to the survey authors' written caution, several independent experts we contacted agreed that the lack of data on drug-use-and-driving interactions suggests that the survey's results be taken with a degree of caution.

Barbara Harsha, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association, added that there's strong evidence that, regardless of the comparative data on substances in drivers' systems, ""drunk driving is still the bigger problem. . . . Alcohol-related crashes were 32 percent of the total in 2008. There’s no comparable data for drug-related crashes, since there are no standards for drug impairment while driving, but the estimates are in the 10 percent to 15 percent range."" If you look no further than the outcome of the survey he cites, Kerlikowske's comment are accurate. But the caveats listed above reduce our confidence that, as he puts it, ""more people are driving under the influence of drugs than are driving under the influence of alcohol."" There's reason to believe that not all of the 16 percent of drivers testing positive for drugs would have been ""under the influence of drugs."" The survey only reveals who has some level of drugs in their system, and does not provide an accurate measure of who was impaired by drugs when they were surveyed. By the same token, it's quite possible that many more than 2.2 percent of the study participants were indeed ""driving under the influence of alcohol"" even if they weren't over the .08 legal threshold. Did these two percentages approach each other in the middle, thus undermining Kerlikowske's statement? Maybe -- or maybe he is right after all. Ultimately, the research isn't yet detailed enough to be sure",Half True,"April 5, 2010"
"Only 15 percent of drug users are African-American, yet 74 percent of all drug offenders sentenced to prison are black","In another example of how the arrest of African-American scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. has driven pundits to talk about issues of race and crime, Arianna Huffington, the founder of the liberal Huffington Post news Web site, offered some statistics about race, drug use and incarceration during a July 26, 2009, roundtable on ABC’s  This Week with George Stephanopoulos  . Huffington said, ""It is really stunning that only 15 percent of the total drug population — drug offending population is African-American. And yet you have 74 percent of them who wind up in jail."" A staffer for Huffington clarified her point: African-Americans make up 15 percent of drug users, but 74 percent of drug offenders sentenced to prison. Her comment echoed longstanding calls by critics of U.S. drug policy and criminal sentencing guidelines. These critics have argued that blacks are unfairly targeted by U.S. drug laws as well as the ways those laws are enforced. So we decided to dig into Huffington’s numbers to see if they were correct.

An aide to Huffington said her numbers came from a 2006 ACLU report, ""Cracks in the System: Twenty Years of the Unjust Federal Crack Cocaine Law,"" and she did indeed report the numbers correctly from that study. The ACLU, in turn, footnoted those numbers to a fact sheet posted by a group called the Interfaith Drug Policy Initiative. When we checked that group’s Web site, however, we could not find any further footnoting for the statistics. So we decided to look at the raw federal data ourselves.

To determine whether blacks account for 15 percent of drug users, we first turned to the 2005 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, released by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services. That study is considered the most reliable in the field, though experts say it probably undercounts harder-core addicts who cannot be reached by survey takers. Among other things, the study quantifies the rates of illicit drug use by different racial and ethnic groups. The drugs studied include marijuana, cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens and inhalants, as well as the nonmedical use of prescription drugs. The numbers do not include tobacco or alcohol.

According to the survey, 9.7 percent of blacks, 8.1 percent of whites and 7.6 percent of Hispanics reported using illicit drugs within the prior month. To convert these figures into something comparable to what Huffington said, we cross-referenced these drug-use rates to the current populations of each ethnic group, according to the Census Bureau. Our calculations showed that 70 percent of drug users are white, 14 percent are black and 13 percent are Hispanic. On this fact, then, Huffington was very, very close.

She wasn’t as accurate, however, on the second half of her assertion, that 74 percent of all drug offenders sentenced to prison are black.

To verify her number, we turned to ""Prisoners in 2007,"" a report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, which is the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Justice. That report offered estimated figures for offenders sentenced to state prison for drug violations: 113,500 blacks, 72,300 whites and 51,100 Hispanics. On a percentage basis, this means that 29 percent of inmates for drug offenses were white, 20 percent were Hispanic and 45 percent were black — well under the 74 percent level asserted by Huffington.

In the federal system, the percentages are lower still for African-Americans. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, for fiscal year 2008, there were 25,273 federal sentences for drug offenses. Of that number, African-American prisoners didn’t even account for the highest percentage among the three biggest groups. Hispanics led with 40 percent, followed by blacks at 31 percent and whites at 25 percent.

One drug policy expert we contacted, Beau Kilmer of the RAND Corp., said our calculations were sound, though he added that Huffington’s comparison of drug use and incarceration has some logical holes. ""We have to realize most drug use is marijuana, and that’s not the reason why people are going to prison — it’s the harder drugs,"" Kilmer said.
   
Ultimately, Huffington was right about one number and quite a bit off with the other. However, even at the much lower rates of incarceration we found, black Americans — who account for about 13 percent of the U.S. population — are still imprisoned for drug offenses at wildly disproportionate rates",Half True,"July 28, 2009"
"""Barack Obama has consistently voted against tougher penalties for criminals.""","A recent attack mailer from the Republican Party of Florida calls Obama ""Soft On Crime."" ""Barack Obama has consistently voted against tougher penalties for criminals — including major offenses — allowing criminals to remain on the streets,"" the mailer states.  This mailer, like so many other mailers and TV ads, cherry-picks a few choice examples and conveniently ignores evidence that contradicts its conclusions. We'll review the four Obama positions highlighted by the mailer to back up its claim, and put Obama's position in a fuller context. We'll also examine Obama's fuller record on each front to show how the ad distorts its claims.  A mail ad targeting Barack Obama.  •   Against tough penalties for drug-related crimes.  ""Obama is against tougher penalties on crack-cocaine users and would use taxpayers dollars to provide addicts with hypodermic needles.""  When the federal Sentencing Commission voted in November to lower sentencing guidelines for crack-related crimes, and bring them closer to sentences for powder cocaine, Obama spoke approvingly of the action and said he supported applying the lower jail terms retroactively to current prisoners. Obama echoed concerns among some civil rights leaders and elected officials about disparities between mandatory prison terms for crack cocaine offenses, which affect mostly black prisoners, and terms for powder cocaine, which affect mostly whites. As for the second part of the claim, Obama did tell the Associated Press in February that if elected, he would move to repeal a 20-year-old ban on federal funding for needle exchange programs. And when he was an Illinois senator, Obama also supported a law that would allow the purchase of needles without a prescription. Obama's position was framed as an attempt to help stem the HIV/AIDS epidemic — particularly acute among black Americans — by encouraging drug addicts who might otherwise use contaminated needles to exchange them for clean ones. Obama also expressed concern about disease being spread to the innocent children of drug users. ""And what’s more important is the fact that many intravenous drug users are now passing on their afflictions onto a spouse who does not engage in drug use or, more tragically, an infant who, as a consequence of being born to a mother who engages in drug use, might be born with AIDS,"" Obama said. ""And so I think I recognize some of the cultural concerns and the symbolic concerns that people may have, what kind of message does this send. But I also think it’s just important to recognize the enormous costs and potentially fatal consequences that we’re placing on individuals when they are reusing dirty needles over and over again. We may think that’s what they deserve, but I personally, at least, think particularly because the impact often goes beyond the drug user themselves, that this is a modest, measured and effective strategy for dealing with this problem."" For the Republican Party of Florida to single out these two positions to conclude that Obama is ""against tough penalties for drug related crimes"" is grossly misleading. It's not hard to find a few examples of Obama initiatives that show just the opposite. For example, Obama took aim at the methamphetamine epidemic when he co-sponsored the Combat Meth Act of 2005, which sought to provide more money to investigate and prosecute methamphetamine offenses, tighten controls on the sale of meth ingredients, and provide assistance grants to the children of meth abusers. And in 1997, Obama voted to increase penalties for marijuana possession.    •   Against protecting children from danger.  ""Obama refused to take a stand and protect our children from guns fired at or near schools.""  This relates to a 1999 bill in the Illinois Senate that sought to allow adult prosecution for juveniles over the age of 15 charged with aggravated battery with a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school. Obama voted ""present,"" a procedural vote that carries the same effect as a no, though the bill passed overwhelmingly. Speaking before the general assembly at the time, Obama said, ""there is really no proof or indication that automatic transfers and increased penalties and adult penalties for juvenile offenses have, in fact, proven to be more effective in reducing juvenile crime or cutting back on recidivism."" Yes, Obama did not support this bill, but there are many other votes that contradict the mailer's blanket claim that Obama is ""against protecting children from danger."" In 2001, for example, Obama voted to increase penalties for repeat sex offenders; for those convicted of child abduction and child molestation. In 2005, he co-sponsored legislation to require sex offender data be available on the Web.    •   Against tougher penalties for street gangs.  ""Obama voted against making gang members eligible for the death penalty if they kill someone to help their gang.""  In 2001, Obama was one of nine Illinois senators who voted against a bill that would have allowed the death penalty for a person convicted of first-degree murder ""in furtherance of a gang activity."" Obama argued the law was too vague about what constituted gang activity and would disproportionately affect black and Hispanic neighborhoods. Again, this bill is not the entirety of Obama’s record with regard to gangs. Someone could just as easily have highligted a few other votes to reach an exactly opposite conclusion. In 2003, Obama voted to prohibit released gang members from associating with their old gang members. In 2004, he voted in favor of a law to make gang recruiting at a school a crime.  •   Against protecting families from abuse.  ""Obama is against a cooling-off-period of 48 hours for those who abuse their family.""  Obama served on the Illinois Senate Judiciary Committee that declined to pass a bill that would have required anyone convicted of domestic battery to serve at least two days in jail. According to a Copley News Service story on April 20, 1999, opponents of the measure feared it would take away too much discretion from judges and tax already overcrowded jails. Specifically, the article says Obama ""questioned whether the bill would hurt prosecutors in the long run. Victims are usually reluctant to testify, so prosecutors have to push more for plea bargains. If defendants know they face a minimum two-day sentence, more will choose to fight their cases in court."" Not mentioned in the mailer is that in 2001, Obama co-sponsored a bill to increase penalties for domestic batteries committed near domestic violence shelters. Or that in 2002, he co-sponsored a bill to toughen penalties for repeat domestic violence offenders. In each case, the RPOF has taken selective votes or positions to prop up sensational headlines that are belied by a fuller examination of Obama's record. Similarly, the claim that Obama has ""  consistently  voted against tougher penalties for criminals"" — when weighed against the entirety of Obama's record — is untrue",False,"October 27, 2008"
