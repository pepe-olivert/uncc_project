"“Humans are not causing climate change.” Magnetic pole shifting “is causing havoc worldwide in weather, climate, earthquakes, tsunamis, etc.”","Is the Earth’s magnetic field affecting our climate and causing disasters? One claim on social media suggests so. ""Humans are not causing climate change,"" a Feb. 10 Instagram post’s caption read. ""We have no way of knowing when this shift will occur or how quickly but it’s been an earth phenomenon for eons. Magnetic pole shifting is complex and I suggest you do some research as it is causing havoc worldwide in weather, climate, earthquakes, tsunamis etc."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Images accompanying the post refer to earthquakes in Turkey and Indonesia and to other real phenomena observed by scientists involving the sun and the Earth’s inner core. Can these crises and changes be attributed to magnetic pole shifts? Experts say no. The Earth’s magnetic field, called the magnetosphere, protects against the erosion of our atmosphere by solar wind, cosmic rays from deep space and other harmful energy. In a 2021 blog, Alan Buis of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory explained why variations in Earth’s magnetic field are not causing climate change. Buis wrote that the position of Earth’s magnetic north pole has gradually drifted by more than 600 miles since 1831, when it was first precisely located. Although this does affect navigation, he said, ""there is little scientific evidence of any significant link between Earth’s drifting magnetic poles and climate."" Pole reversals — when Earth’s magnetic north and south poles swap locations — are common in Earth’s geologic history, having occurred 183 times in the last 83 million years. Hundreds of thousands of years can pass between pole reversals.  The magnetic field does weaken during a pole reversal, but Buis noted that plant and animal fossils from the period of the last major pole reversal ""don’t show any big changes."" At some points in the Earth’s history, there have been ""geomagnetic excursions"" —  shorter-lived but significant changes in the magnetic field’s intensity. The last one, called the Laschamps event, occurred around 41,500 years ago. At the time, the magnetic field significantly weakened and the poles reversed. In a study published in Science in February 2021, lead author Alan Cooper, formerly of University of Adelaide in Australia and the South Australian Museum, joined 32 other scientists in arguing that the Laschamps event led to shifts in global climate. The scientists analyzed the rings of ancient New Zealand kauri trees to track changes in radiocarbon levels during the pole reversal. That research, however, was criticized by other scientists who published a response in Science. Led by researchers from Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany and the Institut Català de Paleoecologia Humana i Evolució Social in Spain, they argued that ""other scientific studies indicate that that proposition is unproven from the current archaeological, paleoanthropological, and genetic records."" ""In our view,"" they wrote, ""Cooper et al. have used the archaeological and paleontological data selectively in order to create a narrative that could support the Laschamps as the main driver of a global environmental crisis."" Other experts told PolitiFact that the 2021 study from Australia is controversial. Monika Korte, interim leader of the geomagnetism section at the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, said it is ""quite disputed among scientists."" The current magnetic field changes are much less than what occurred during the Laschamps event, she said.  Andrew Biggin, a paleomagnetism professor at the University of Liverpool, said that even if someone were to accept the Lanchamps study’s claim that the shift produced changes in the global climate, that event stands apart from what is happening with climate now: ""The Laschamps event 42,000 years ago was far, far more severe a geomagnetic event than anything we are seeing today,"" he said. ""There’s no evidence that Earth’s climate has been significantly impacted by the last three magnetic field excursions, nor by any excursion event within at least the last 2.8 million years,"" Buis wrote in August 2021.  Variations in the magnetic field do not affect the Earth’s environment at its surface. The earthquakes in Turkey and Indonesia were not caused by magnetic pole shifting. According to the United States Geological Survey, electromagnetic variations have been observed after earthquakes, ""but despite decades of work, there is no convincing evidence of electromagnetic precursors to earthquakes.""  Korte and Biggin both said magnetic pole shifting does not influence the occurrence of earthquakes.  The energy that drives the climate system in the upper atmosphere — where electromagnetic currents exist — is only a minute fraction of the energy that drives the climate system at the Earth’s surface, Buis said. This means it does not have enough energy to influence the climate as we experience it.  He said there is also no known physical mechanism that can connect the Earth’s weather conditions on its surface with electromagnetic currents in space.  Experts agree that humans are the more significant contributor to climate change.  ""Solar wind particles entering all the way into the atmosphere might have a small influence in the overall weather and climate system, but their role is definitely much weaker than that of the current man-made climate change from greenhouse gas emissions,"" Korte said. Biggin said, ""Any current magnetic influence on the climate will be totally dwarfed by the anthropogenic influence of carbon emissions.""  PolitiFact previously fact-checked the claim that humans are not causing climate change and rated it False.  Scientists trace this phenomenon to the Industrial Revolution, which began in 1760. Since that period, carbon dioxide rose 40% and methane by 150%. High levels of these and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap heat at the Earth’s surface, warming the planet.

There is wide consensus among climate scientists that the Earth is warming and that humans directly contributed to this change by burning fossil fuels.  An Instagram post said ""humans are not causing climate change"" and blamed climate change, earthquakes and weather disturbances on  magnetic pole shifts. There is broad scientific consensus that the climate is changing and that human activity is responsible primarily because of the burning of fossil fuels. Pole reversals have occurred several times in the Earth’s geologic history. A 2021 study suggested a pole reversal 41,500 years ago had an effect on the climate. But the study has been subject to debate, with other scientists arguing that the research cherry-picked data and ignored other evidence.  Either way, experts say changes in the magnetic field don’t affect the weather and climate on the Earth’s surface or the occurrence of earthquakes",False,"February 15, 2023"
"“Right now, driving 100 miles in an electric vehicle is more expensive than driving an internal combustion engine car.”","Last year’s soaring gasoline prices drove many Americans to consider electric vehicles as a cheaper alternative to paying at the pump. A recent Facebook post claims that’s a misguided quest, and it’s more expensive to drive an electric car than one with an internal combustion engine. ""Are you one of those people driving down the road past the gas station, smugly thinking ‘at least I'm not paying for gas,’"" said conservative radio host Erick Erickson in a video shared Jan. 27 on Facebook. ""Or do you think, ‘At least I'm not destroying the planet so long as I don't think about the coal-fire plant powering my car,’"" Erickson continued. Then, citing a post published by car blog Jalopnik, Erickson said, ""Right now, driving 100 miles in an electric vehicle is more expensive than driving an internal combustion engine car.""  The video was excerpted from an episode of Erickson’s podcast, on which he also claimed the U.S. government is driving up petroleum prices to push people toward electric cars, and that increasing dependence on renewable energy sources like solar and wind power will eventually spark an energy crisis.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) The Jalopnik blog post Erickson mentioned refers to a report released in late January by Anderson Economic Group, which looked at fuel costs for midpriced vehicles and luxury cars from Oct. 1 to Dec. 31, 2022.  Because of rising electricity costs, the report found that for the first time in 18 months, it was cheaper to fuel a midpriced internal combustion engine car than it was to charge an electric vehicle. The comparison did not hold true for luxury vehicles, though. The report said drivers of midpriced electric cars paid about $11.60 to charge their vehicles at home for 100 miles of driving. Drivers who used commercial charging stations paid about $14.49. By comparison, drivers of similarly priced internal combustion engine cars paid about $11.29 in fuel costs for 100 miles of driving.  Fuel costs were higher for luxury cars. For those vehicles, electric car owners paid about $12.40 for at-home charging and about $15.95 for commercial charging for 100 miles of driving. Those with internal combustion engine vehicles paid about $19.96.  The Anderson Economic Group calculated the costs based on the price of the underlying energy — such as gas, diesel and electricity — excise taxes, the cost of operating a fuel pump or charging station and driving to a fueling station.  But the group’s conclusions and methodology have critics. Car and Driver magazine pointed out the report based its fuel, electricity and tax costs on prices in Michigan. Each of the costs vary by state, but the study did not account for this:  Another criticism of the study is that it didn’t account for electric vehicles’ impact on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Although the report acknowledged the ""environmental costs of different types of vehicles,"" it focused solely on the cost of fueling.  Car and Driver said calculating the environmental costs between electric and internal combustion engine cars may be difficult, but focusing only on fuel costs ""feels disingenuous."" Estimates vary for the environmental benefits of an electric car, but the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit science advocacy organization, found in 2015 that, regardless of its electricity source, an electric car produces less than half of the greenhouse gas emissions of a similarly sized internal combustion engine car.  Several estimates found that after being driven for 15,000 to 20,000 miles, an electric car reaches the point of offsetting the carbon emissions made by its production.  Anderson Economic Group’s report also didn’t account for the difference in maintenance costs between electric and internal combustion engine cars.  In 2020, Consumer Reports found that it costs about half as much to maintain electric cars because they have ""fewer moving parts than internal combustion engines, and they don’t require fluid changes."" The organization compared nine electric cars priced at less than $50,000 that were popular in 2020 with three comparable internal combustion engine vehicles. It found the lifetime ownership cost for electric cars was $6,000 to $10,000 cheaper than their gas-powered counterparts.  We contacted Erickson for comment. He acknowledged our query on Twitter but did not respond to the request for comment.  Citing a post by car blog Jalopnik, Erickson said, ""Right now, driving 100 miles in an electric vehicle is more expensive than driving an internal combustion engine car."" The claim was based on a study conducted by the Anderson Economic Group, which found that from Oct. 1 to Dec. 31, 2022, for midpriced vehicles, it was more expensive to charge an electric car than to fuel one with an internal combustion engine.  But the comparison did not hold true for luxury vehicles. And the report didn’t account for differing costs across the nation for fuel, electricity and taxes. It also did not factor in other points of cost comparison between the vehicles, such as maintenance and environmental costs.  The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context",Half True,"February 14, 2023"
Wind farm construction is a possible cause of dead whales washing ashore in New Jersey.,"Is a surge in whale deaths on the Atlantic Coast caused by underwater sounds related to wind energy? ""Dead whales are washing up on the Jersey shore in record numbers, and so far there’s one very curious possible cause: green energy,"" read an Instagram post by Faust Checho, a podcast host and actor. ""They’re building large-scale wind farms off the East Coast — conducting underwater surveys before construction,"" he said in the video post. ""They’re using pulses of low-frequency sound beneath the ocean’s surface."" The post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) We didn’t get a reply to emails we sent to an address for Checho’s podcast or to a message we sent to him on Instagram. There has been an increase in Jersey Shore whale strandings. But government and private experts said there is no evidence to support the claim that whales are being killed by sounds emitted during underwater surveying ahead of wind farm construction.  They said the main causes of death remain whales being struck by ships or becoming entangled in fishing lines. ""I’ve been using the analogy that it’s Sherlock Holmes looking in closets for the murderer when there’s a guy in the drawing room with a smoking gun,"" said Paul Sieswerda, executive director of the Gotham Whale research and advocacy group in New York. On Jan. 30, 12 New Jersey Shore mayors called for a moratorium on offshore wind energy activities. They asked for investigations to determine whether the work contributed to seven whales washing ashore in 38 days.  The unprecedented number of stranding deaths ""coincides with ongoing activity from acoustic survey vessels,"" the mayors said in a letter to the New Jersey congressional delegation.  A whale death in the Maryland area led Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., to call for a moratorium ""until it is definitively proven that this construction and geotechnical testing are not the cause of repeated whale deaths."" New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, has said the recent whale does are tragic but that wind farm preparation work should not be halted. He cited statements from federal officials denying any link between the deaths and the work. Because of an increase in whale deaths in the Atlantic Ocean, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration made two ""unusual mortality event"" declarations, one in 2016 for humpback whales and one in 2017 for right whales. An unusual mortality event is an unexpected stranding of marine mammals that ""involves a significant die-off"" and ""demands immediate response,"" according to the federal agency. There have been 181 strandings of humpbacks in the 13 Atlanta Coast states from 2016 through 2023. Nearly one-third (59) occurred in New York or New Jersey. In 2023, there were five strandings in New York and New Jersey as of Feb. 7 — compared with six in all of 2022. The strandings of right whales have occurred mostly in states other than New York and New Jersey. Federal officials said wind energy had no role in the deaths In response to the recent strandings, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said, ""There is no evidence to support speculation that noise"" from wind development-related work  could potentially cause whale deaths and ""no specific links between recent large whale mortalities and currently ongoing surveys for offshore wind development."" The ""greatest human threats"" to large whales, the agency said, are whales being struck by vessels or becoming entangled in fishing lines. Sieswerda, the former curator of the New York Aquarium and the New England Aquarium, told PolitiFact that necropsies show that the most common cause of whale deaths, including the recent ones off the Jersey Shore, are whales being struck or entangled.  The sonar used undersea surveys ahead of wind energy development is not loud enough to endanger whales, he added. The increase in whale deaths ""is troubling, and why that is happening I don’t have a good answer,"" Sieswerda said, ""other than perhaps they’re changing their feeding areas to areas of high boat traffic."" Ed Hale, a professor at the University of Delaware’s Sea Grant Program, said humpback whales can tolerate even underwater explosions and drilling, much more significant sound disturbances than what has occurred on the Jersey Shore for wind farms.  More whales seem to be attracted to prey in the area, which are concentrated in some of the shipping lanes of the eastern seaboard’s busiest ports. That increases the chances of collisions that can kill whales, Hale said.  Trevor Branch, professor at the University of Washington School of Aquatic and Fisheries Sciences, said Navy sonar has been linked to beaked whale strandings, but not right whales or other large whales.  ""It's very unlikely but not impossible"" that the link indicates that sounds from work for wind farms could cause larger whale deaths. ""I'm not aware of any published research suggesting such a link,"" he said. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and some New Jersey environmentalists have said that whales in the area are also affected by climate change. They said temperature changes affect food supplies and other ocean characteristics, causing whales to change their movements. An Instagram post claimed that wind farm construction is a possible cause of dead whales washing ashore in New Jersey. New Jersey has seen four whale strandings so far in 2023, the same number as in 2022. But experts said it is premature and unproven to tie the deaths to preparation work for wind farm construction.  The experts said there is no evidence that the work has caused any of the deaths. They said the leading human causes of the strandings are whales being struck by vessels or becoming entangled in fishing lines. The statement contains an element of truth, in that the deaths  coincide with preparation work for wind farms. But there is no evidence so far that the work caused the deaths",Mostly False,"February 8, 2023"
Global warming is a “fraud.”,"Multiple social media posts continue to downplay or, in some cases, outright deny the existence of climate change despite overwhelming evidence supporting the scientific consensus it exists and is fueled by human activity.  One Facebook post shared Jan. 25 went as far as calling the concept a ""fraud.""  Nick Adams, a conservative pundit, shared a post featuring a photo of himself with text superimposed on the image assailing climate change.  ""Global warming is the most significant fraud perpetrated on humanity this century,"" Adams said in the text.  Adams included a caption with the photo that dismisses technology meant to combat climate change, saying, ""no more windmills, no more solar panels and no more electric cars.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) PolitiFact has debunked similar claims about climate change being a hoax or scam in the past.  Adams doesn’t explain why he says climate change is a fraud; however, evidence proving its existence is plentiful and dates as early as the 1800s.  The concept of the greenhouse effect, where gases in the Earth’s atmosphere trap and retain the sun’s heat, was first proposed in 1824 by French physicist Joseph Fourier.  Fourier calculated that, based on its size and distance from the sun, Earth should have been colder than it was in the 1820s. He theorized that Earth’s atmosphere acted as an insulator, trapping heat close to the planet’s surface.  Following Fourier’s theory, scientists in separate experiments during the late 1800s observed that certain gases such as carbon dioxide exhibited heat-absorbing properties.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency considers carbon dioxide one of the primary greenhouse gases contributing to climate change. Nearly 80% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States in 2020 were carbon dioxide. Although the Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, NASA said the current warming trend the planet is undergoing is happening too rapidly to be natural.  Human activity spurred by the Industrial Revolution caused an increase in burning fossil fuels, releasing large amounts of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere.  ""It is undeniable that human activities have produced the atmospheric gases that have trapped more of the Sun’s energy in the Earth system,"" NASA’s website said. ""This extra energy has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred."" The release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere from human activity is happening at a rate that’s 250 times faster than from natural sources following the last ice age, according to NASA.  Earth’s average temperature has increased by around 2 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880, when modern temperature measurements began, and continues to rise, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration reported. Besides the evidence of climate change’s existence, NASA said 97% of ""actively publishing climate scientists"" agree it’s real and driven by humans.  A vast majority of domestic and international scientific organizations acknowledge the reality of climate change and humanity’s role. A Facebook post claimed climate change is the ""most significant fraud perpetrated on humanity."" Most of the world’s scientists found that climate change is real and fueled by human activity.  Climate change’s impact on the world can be traced back to the 1800s, when the Industrial Revolution led to an increase in the burning of fossil fuels and a corresponding release of greenhouse gases into the Earth’s atmosphere. The gases trap heat from the sun, warming the planet and causing temperatures to rise",False,"January 31, 2023"
“NASA stopped exploring the ocean.”,"A video shared on Instagram claimed that NASA, the federal agency most associated with space, has stopped exploring Earth’s oceans.

The post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) In September, Lead Stories and USA Today fact-checked similar videos and rated them false.  This new claim is wrong, too. ""NASA has been involved in ocean science research since its founding"" in 1958, a NASA spokesperson told PolitiFact. The work happens in the sea and from satellites.  Here’s some of what we found: NASA’s Physical Oceanography program involves research for understanding the ocean’s role in climate. Study areas include sea level change, ocean surface topography and ocean surface salinity. Researchers also study ocean salinity as it relates to weather phenomena. In December, NASA presented a 2½-hour program on its Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission, which will ""survey nearly all water on the Earth's surface for the first time."" The journal Science reported that the $1.5 billion mission will study circular movements of water known as eddies, ""the most energetic feature of the ocean, critical to getting climate models right.""  In January 2022, the BBC reported on NASA’s exploration of ""the deep ocean to search for clues of what oceans on other planets could look like."" The Systematic Underwater Biogeochemical Science and Exploration Analog program, or SUBSEA, uses remotely operated vehicles launched from a sea vessel to study ocean depths, according to NASA. In 2024, NASA plans to launch a space observatory for further ocean study. On an oceanography page of its website, NASA explained why it studies oceans:  ""Part of NASA's mission is to develop an understanding of the total Earth system and the effects of natural and human-induced changes on the global environment. Our oceans play a major role in influencing changes in the world's climate and weather."" An Instagram post said: ""NASA stopped exploring the ocean.""

“NOAA makes it official… CO2 warming is a hoax.”,"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has a website devoted to helping people understand climate change, but some social media posts claim the agency’s own data dispels the notion that the planet is warming.  ""NOAA makes it official,"" reads a screenshot of a tweet from Junkscience.com founder Steve Milloy. ""Last 8 years... global cooling... at a rate of 0.11°C/decade.... despite 450+ billion tons of emissions worth 14% of total manmade CO2 in the atmosphere. CO2 warming is a hoax.""

But climate change isn’t a hoax, and human emissions of carbon dioxide contribute to global warming.  ""Not only do CO2 and temperature correlate, but there is a causative relationship as well that is unequivocal,"" said Howard Diamond, climate science program manager at NOAA’s air resources laboratory. Diamond told PolitiFact that the data cited in the social media posts was cherry-picked — in this case, eight years out of more than 140 — and ignores long-term data that shows global average temperatures increasing.  Diamond said global temperature has risen at a rate of +0.08º Celsius a decade, or +0.144º Fahrenheit a decade.  ""For someone to state that the planet has been cooling for the last eight years, or even the last 80 years, simply defies the scientific data and is made up in someone’s mind,"" Diamond said.  Also, the annual global human emissions of carbon dioxide is now up to 38 gigatons, Diamond said. That’s relatively small compared to the 750 gigatons that move through the natural carbon cycle each year, he said, but ""it adds up because the land and ocean cannot absorb all the extra human-sourced CO2 being emitted by the burning of fossil fuels.""  About 40% of this additional human-emitted carbon dioxide is absorbed by oceans, Diamond said. The rest remains in the atmosphere, and ""as a consequence,"" atmospheric carbon dioxide is at its highest level in 15 million to 20 million years, he said.  There was a brief temperature decline after 2016 — then the warmest year on record — that reflected a strong El Niño event, according to NASA. Similar periods of cooling have followed other El Niños, a climate pattern that affects the weather.

But climate change is not a fabricated crisis, and the scientific community’s consensus is that human activity since the Industrial Revolution has fueled the changes.  PolitiFact has rated False similar statements that said climate change is a natural occurrence not influenced by greenhouse gas emissions from human activity.  Ronald Amundson, an environmental science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told PolitiFact that although it’s true that Earth’s climate has changed naturally throughout history, those changes — such as the ice ages mentioned in the Instagram post — are unrelated to what’s happening now.  NASA said natural changes to the Earth’s climate, including ice ages, are caused by small changes in the Earth's orbit, which affect how much solar energy the planet receives.  ""That is not the same as the human-driven climate change that is occurring now,"" Amundson said. Modern climate change ""has no natural cause"" and is a result of human changes to the atmosphere, he said.   He said if greenhouse gases from human activity had no bearing on the Earth’s climate, and didn’t trap heat within the atmosphere, we would be entering into a ""general cooling situation"" rather than the warming that’s happening.  The amount of solar energy the Earth has received hasn't seen a net increase since the 1950s, but global temperatures have continued to rise. NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency found that humans started to influence the Earth’s climate significantly with the start of the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century. An increase in manufacturing and fossil fuel usage resulted in the release of large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.   Whendee Silver, a UC Berkeley environmental science professor, said gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane help trap heat within the Earth’s atmosphere, warming it and changing the climate long term.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that the Earth’s average temperature has risen by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit — an average of 0.14 degrees Fahrenheit every decade — since 1880, when modern global temperature measurements began.  An Instagram post says, ""Climate change is a naturally occurring phenomenon that can be tracked throughout prehistoric eras."" Earth’s climate has naturally changed in the past, partly because of variations in the planet’s orbit, which affected how much solar radiation the planet received. But the scientific consensus is that human activity is mainly driving current changes in the Earth’s climate. The increase in manufacturing and burning of fossil fuels led to large releases of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, trapping heat and causing global temperatures to rise",False,"January 23, 2023"

Climate change is “dictated by solar activity and the moon” and has “nothing to do with mankind.”,"The consensus within the scientific community is that human activity fuels global climate change, but a video clip shared on Instagram on Nov. 13 featuring a known climate skeptic claims people aren’t to blame.  In the video, Piers Corbyn, an astrophysicist, said heat waves are caused by ""certain circulation patterns"" from solar activity and phases of the moon.  ""These things are dictated by solar activity and the moon,"" Corbyn said in the video, an excerpt from his 2010 appearance on Russia Today, a Russian state-funded news channel. ""They have nothing to do with mankind."" He accused people who say human activity contributes to climate change of ""just trying to make money."" The Instagram post’s caption says, ""this guy gets it, pay attention,"" and includes hashtags such as #globalwarminghoax and #climatechangehoax.   The Instagram post was flagged as part of Instagram’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) Climate scientists have said the sun and moon influence the Earth’s climate, but not enough to contribute to the large-scale climate changes of the last several decades. PolitiFact has rated False similar statements that minimize human activity’s role in climate change. NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency determined that humans began to significantly impact the Earth’s climate during the Industrial Revolution, when manufacturing and burning fossil fuels led to the release of large amounts of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. About 200 scientific organizations have concluded that human activity drives climate change.  Corbyn, brother of British politician Jeremy Corbyn, received a degree in astrophysics in 1981. He launched a weather forecasting company in 1995 called WeatherAction, which he has used to label climate change as ""propaganda"" and promote anti-vaccination conspiracy theories related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  In 2021 he compared the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine in the United Kingdom to the Holocaust.  If the sun were partially responsible for climate change, there would have been a measurable increase in solar radiation starting in the late 1970s when scientists began to notice a rapid rise in global temperatures, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. However, according to NASA, scientists found no noticeable increase in solar radiation since 1978, when they began using satellites to measure the amount of solar energy Earth receives. A 2008 study conducted in the United Kingdom found solar activity had been declining for 20 years but led to no drops in global temperatures.  If the sun played an outsized role in climate change, every layer of the Earth’s atmosphere would experience warming. NOAA and NASA reported that there is warming in the lower atmosphere but cooling in the upper stratosphere, which is consistent with climate change caused by a greenhouse gas buildup in Earth’s lower atmosphere, which traps in heat. That doesn’t mean the sun doesn’t affect Earth’s climate, but its effect is significantly smaller than Corbyn claims.  The video’s reference to ""certain circulation patterns"" is about how air moves across the Earth through atmospheric circulation. Because the sun’s heat is more focused along the equator, warm air flows away from that area toward the north and south poles.  As the air travels through the poles, it cools, then drops back to the equator to be rewarmed, repeating the pattern, according to the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. This air movement influences specific areas’ daily weather and the regional climate, but not global climate change. Researchers at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom have studied the moon’s potential impact on climate change. The study, which has not been peer-reviewed, found that shifts in the moon’s orbit can increase or decrease the Earth’s climate by about 0.04 degrees Celsius depending on the lunar cycle.  Ed Hawkins, the study’s lead author, told the New Scientist, a British magazine, that the moon has a ""small effect"" on the climate and doesn’t explain any of the long-term trends that have been observed with rising global temperatures.  An Instagram post says climate change is ""dictated by solar activity and the moon"" and has ""nothing to do with mankind."" Scientists found that the sun and moon do affect Earth’s climate, but their influence is small and does not account for the rapid planetary climate changes of the last several decades.  An overwhelming number of scientists and scientific organizations agree that human activity significantly affects climate change",False,"November 29, 2022"
John Kerry at COP27 climate summit spoke about wanting to “wipe out the middle class … get you under the central banking digital currency system.”,"During the United Nations’ COP27 climate summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, John Kerry, the United States’ special presidential envoy for climate, discussed the need for private companies and governments to work together to address climate change. An Instagram post has interpreted his remarks as an attack on capitalism and the middle class.  A man shared a video of himself talking about Kerry’s Nov. 7 remarks, using a screenshot from a Gateway Pundit article as his background. The article’s headline said, ""John Kerry Spills the Beans at U.N.’s COP27 Meeting: They Want to Replace Capitalism with a New Economic System."" ""They want to wipe out the middle class, they want to get you under the central banking digital currency system, or you’ll see a carbon tax, you’ll see a social credit score, and they will take your rights away,"" the man said in the video. Many of the man’s talking points come from the post from the Gateway Pundit, a conservative website known to spread misinformation.  The ""they"" mentioned by the man and Gateway Pundit post appears to be the First Movers Coalition, a partnership between the U.S. and the World Economic Forum. The coalition began in 2021 and involves more than 50 private companies pledging to invest in greener technologies and renewable energy sources within the transportation and industrial sectors.  A World Economic Forum spokesperson told PolitiFact there’s no truth to the claims from the Instagram video and The Gateway Pundit. Those claims are related to conspiracy theories surrounding the World Economic Forum’s ""The Great Reset"" policy ideas. The Instagram post was flagged as part of Instagram’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) During a COP27 panel, Kerry spoke about the First Movers Coalition, which went from 25 member companies in 2021 to 65 members in 2022. He detailed the need for these companies to spearhead efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and keep global temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-Industrial Revolution levels.  Companies pledging to be more environmentally friendly should boost demand for greener technology, Kerry said.  ""We have an enormous challenge ahead of us to bring to scale new technologies and to harness the deeply capable capacity of private sector entrepreneurs in order to bring them to the table because, without it, no government has enough money to accelerate, to support the process,"" Kerry said. ""We need everybody engaged in this."" The Instagram video doesn’t say why encouraging companies to invest in greener technologies would end capitalism or destroy the middle class.  However, the Gateway Pundit claims that creating an artificial demand for environmentally friendly items, such as electric cars and nonlivestock meat alternatives, would have detrimental consequences. In one example, the outlet said promoting meat alternatives would lead to a decreased demand in beef and a reduction in livestock in the U.S. in favor of ""crickets and other insects"" as protein.  However, the Environmental Protection Agency has said that extreme weather events such as floods, droughts and heat waves are what can decimate crops and kill livestock.  Kerry did not mention a central banking digital currency system, carbon tax or a social credit score during his speech at COP27.  Yann Zopf, a World Economic Forum spokesperson, told PolitiFact the organization believes digital currencies ""have a role to play in building a global financial system"" in a post-pandemic world, but it can only recommend, not mandate its use.  Zopf said the World Economic Forum is not a legislative body; its role is to enable cooperation between private companies and governments. ""The claims (in the Instagram video) are false and misleading,"" he said. The World Economic Forum said the Great Reset’s proposals are designed to shape ""global relations, the direction of national economies, the priorities of societies, the nature of business models and the management of a global commons"" in a post-COVID-19 world. The initiative recommends that governments better coordinate tax and fiscal policies, update trade agreements and use technological innovations to address health and social challenges.  Because of its broad proposals to ""reset capitalism,"" the Great Reset has been the target of multiple conspiracy theories. An Instagram video claimed Kerry spoke about wanting to ""wipe out the middle class … get you under the central banking digital currency system.""

"""They say the ocean will rise one-eighth of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years.""","Announcing his run to retake the White House, former President Donald Trump made a claim that seemed to ridicule expert projections about climate change.

""You cannot mention the nuclear word; it’s too devastating. The Green New Deal and the environment — which they say may affect us in 300 years — is all that is talked about. And yet nuclear weapons, which would destroy the world immediately, are never even discussed as a major threat. Can you imagine?"" he said. ""They say the ocean will rise one-eighth of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years, but don't worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot."" Trump’s quip got some laughter from the audience. But his dismissal of predictions for climate change-driven sea level rise is ""so far from accurate as to appear to have been entirely fabricated,"" said Michael Oppenheimer, director of the Center for Policy Research on Energy and the Environment at Princeton University. A Trump spokesperson did not respond to our emails. Trump made virtually the same claim as president during a 2019 rally. As our friends at FactCheck.org reported, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said then that global sea level was increasing by about one-eighth of an inch per year. Reports issued in 2022 continue to dispel Trump’s claim: NOAA reported that U.S. sea level in 2100 is projected to be around 2 feet higher on average than it was in 2000, ""if we are able to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions."" The estimate grows to 7.2 feet if on a ""pathway with high greenhouse gas emissions and rapid ice sheet collapse."" The National Ocean Service, a part of the NOAA, predicted that sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 to 12 inches from 2020 to 2050 — as much as the rise that was measured from 1920 to 2020. Gary Griggs, an earth sciences professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, said the state of California has advised coastal communities to plan for sea level increases of between 1 foot and 2½ feet by 2050. Griggs also said that NOAA’s tide gauge for Palm Beach shows a rise of 0.15 inches per year. Almost 30% of the U.S. population lives in relatively high population-density coastal areas ""where sea level plays a role in flooding, shoreline erosion and hazards from storms,"" according to NOAA.  In coastal urban areas around the world, roads, bridges, subways, water supplies, oil and gas wells, power plants, and other infrastructure ""are all at risk from sea level rise,"" the NOAA report said. Global warming is causing the global mean sea level to rise, because glaciers and ice sheets worldwide are melting and adding water to the ocean, and the ocean’s volume is expanding as the water warms, the agency said. The nonprofit Climate Central projected in September that in the U.S., property with an assessed value of at least $108 billion is at risk from rising seas by 2100. Trump said, ""They say the ocean will rise one-eighth of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years."" Experts predict rises in sea level many times larger than what Trump claimed.

Biden’s Nov. 4 stop included a speech to local Democrats and employees of Viasat, a satellite internet provider and communications firm headquartered in Carlsbad.  During the speech, Biden focused on his administration’s economic achievements, including the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, which included nearly $40 billion in subsidies to encourage domestic semiconductor production. Viasat designs semiconductors for many products, including satellite internet gear and encryption devices for the U.S. government, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Biden also touched on reining in the cost of insulin and his administration’s historic climate investments.

Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, trap heat in the atmosphere, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Methane is one of the main greenhouse gases that contributes to climate change, according to the World Meteorological Association and the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  All organisms produce methane, according to a study in the journal Nature.  Cattle are ruminants — grass-chewing animals with hooves and multichambered stomachs.

However, we found several instances of climate change predictions, including those going back to the 1970s, that closely matched what came to pass.  Kirk did not respond to a request for comment. It isn’t uncommon for climate skeptics to claim climate predictions have been wrong. Many climate change predictions are based on modeling, which involves putting data into a computer program and having the program make predictions. It’s not a perfect science, as it’s difficult to account for all the relevant data about an entire planet.  One way to determine a model’s accuracy is to look at old models and see how well they withstood the test of time. A 2019 study in the journal Geophysical Research Letters showed that of 17 climate models published from 1970 to 2007, 10 closely matched the global average temperatures that occurred. That number increased to 14 after ""accounting for differences between modeled and actual changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and other factors that drive climate,"" according to a 2020 NASA article about the study.  Another 2012 study in the journal Nature Climate Change found that 1990 predictions from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change were fairly accurate. IPCC had suggested that by 2030, Earth would have warmed about 1.1 degrees Celsius, which would amount to about 0.55 degrees Celsius by 2012. The warming that occurred was about 0.39 degrees Celsius.  Despite the difference in the projected and actual temperatures, the 1990 prediction is accurate, Penny Whetton, senior principal research scientist at the Australian government agency Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and a lead author for the Third Assessment Report of the IPCC, told the nonprofit news website The Conversation in 2012. The difference between the projected 0.55 degrees and the observed 0.39 degrees is because of natural fluctuations, Whetton said. ""This is good evidence to show that what the IPCC has been saying for a while is coming true,"" she added.  Gavin A. Schmidt, director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, has noted that plenty of climate predictions have come true. For example, in a 2021 opinion column, he pointed to the Nobel prize-winning Suki Manabe, who in 1967 correctly predicted surface warming and stratospheric cooling. And since its 1990 prediction, the IPCC has continued to make predictions that end up being close to real, observed temperatures. Schmidt said in an email interview with PolitiFact that Kirk’s ""summary of the success of climate modeling is simply wrong."" Schmidt said there are always examples of sensationalized predictions in the scientific community, but Kirk was ""clearly implying something about the mainstream scientific community, not unsupported outliers."" Kirk says for climate change environmentalists, ""not a single one of their predictions ever come true.""  The claim is not supported by evidence.

Debbie Lesko opposes Democrats’ climate change plans. Recently, she harsh words for the push to expand the use of electrical vehicles.  ""The average cost of replacing an electric vehicle battery is over $10,000, while the average cost of replacing the battery of a gas-powered car is $100-$200,"" Lesko tweeted Aug. 30. ""Democrats’ green energy only agenda will bankrupt the American people.""  The average cost of replacing an electric vehicle battery is over $10,000, while the average cost of replacing the battery of a gas-powered car is $100-$200. Democrats’ green energy only agenda will bankrupt the American people. Do the different price tags for batteries reflect the overall relative cost of electric and gas-powered cars? Automotive experts say they don’t. ""It’s apples-to-oranges to compare the batteries for EVs and conventional cars,"" said Hanna Breetz, an assistant professor with ASU’s school of sustainability ""They’re different technologies, doing different things in the vehicles. So the numbers aren’t wrong, but you could push back saying that it’s a specious comparison.""  A traditional battery simply starts the car engine, while the battery for an electric vehicle stores all the power needed for moving the vehicle.  Replacing gas-powered cars and light trucks with electric versions is central to the government’s climate plans. The U.S. Transportation Department has set a goal of having 50% of newly sold vehicles be electric zero-emissions vehicles by 2030.  Because of the complex nature of hybrid vehicles — cars that use a blend of gas and electric power systems — this fact-check focuses solely on the batteries in traditional gas-powered vehicles and those in fully electric vehicles. Andy Garberson, head of marketing for the consulting group Recurrent Auto, said that electric vehicle battery prices can vary widely, depending on the car model. Generally, the cost falls between $2,000-$20,000. Lesko’s numbers are in the middle of that range. Her prices for traditional batteries are also reasonably accurate. Beyond that, Lesko’s comparison is misleading, said Jeffrey Wishart, an automotive systems concentration professor at Arizona State University. ""The high-voltage propulsion battery in EVs should not be compared with the 12-volt starting/lighting/ignition batteries of all cars,"" Whishart said ""The fair comparison would be to compare the cost of the high volt battery and electric motor with the cost of the internal combustion engine and gasoline tank."" Standard 12-volt batteries are cheaper because they are simpler and produced in high volume, which reduces production costs. Mark Schrimer, director of corporate communications of Cox Automotive, an automotive data and online systems vendor, said 12-volt batteries are interchangeable across car makes and models, while the batteries for electric vehicles are custom made. In a traditional car, a 12-volt battery plays a limited role.  The battery packs in full electric vehicles ""are very high-tech items, made of advanced materials; they are custom made for each vehicle and not interchangeable,"" Schrimer said. Lesko also overlooks that manufacturers generally provide multi-year warranties for EV battery replacement, which often last up to 100,000 miles or 10 years. California requires 10-year/150,000 mile warranties on all electric and hybrid vehicles. Michael Kuby, a geographical studies and urban planning professor at ASU said that ultimately, the price comparison ""depends on the total cost of ownership."" The lifetime cost of owning electric vehicles is a moving target. Technology improvements and the economics of producing them in larger volumes both work to push costs down.  Consumer Reports found that even with higher upfront costs for electric vehicles, lower operating and maintenance costs make them a better deal for buyers. They estimate that EV owners save between $6,000 and $10,000 over a car’s lifetime. A study from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory found that EV owners save as much as $14,500 on fuel costs over 15 years. Lesko said that ""the average cost of replacing an electric vehicle battery is over $10,000, while the average cost of replacing the battery of a gas-powered car is $100 to $200."" Her numbers are in the ballpark, but beyond that, her comparison breaks down. The two types of car batteries play fundamentally different roles in the operation of a car. A traditional battery only starts the engine. An electric vehicle battery stores all the power needed for moving the vehicle. In addition, early studies found that over a car’s lifetime, consumers save money with electric vehicles because of lower fuel and maintenance costs.  The tweet includes numbers that are fairly accurate, but it omits important context that would change a reader’s understanding of the price difference",Mostly False,"October 19, 2022"

""Marco has denied climate change and refuses to deal with the issues that affect our environment,"" Demings said in a Sept. 23 tweet. ""Florida deserves better.""  Generally, climate change refers to shifts in temperatures and weather patterns driven largely by humans and their burning of fossil fuels. The connection between climate change and hurricanes is complicated and involves ongoing research, PolitiFact reported. Rubio's past skepticism of climate change science is well documented.  When a liberal group in 2013 said Rubio is ""a climate change denier,"" we rated the statement Mostly True. The caveat was that some of Rubio's remarks about climate change bordered on skepticism rather than outright denial. But Rubio's stance has shifted in recent years. Since 2018, Rubio has said Earth's climate is changing and humans, to some degree, have contributed to the changes.  Rubio's position on climate change seemed ambiguous before he set his sights on national office. As Florida House speaker in 2007, for example, Rubio referenced the existence of global warming and embraced energy diversification.  ""Global warming, dependence on foreign sources of fuel, and capitalism have come together to create opportunities for us that were unimaginable just a few short years ago,"" Rubio said in a speech to state legislators. ""Florida has the opportunity to pursue bold energy policies, not just because they're good for our environment, but because people can actually make money doing it.""  At the time, Rubio didn't outright acknowledge humans' ​​​​impact on the environment. By 2009, as he launched his bid for the U.S. Senate, Rubio began questioning whether humans have caused climate change.   Asked about human impact on the climate in 2009, Rubio told the Miami Herald: ""I'm not a scientist. I'm not qualified to make that decision. There's a significant scientific dispute about that."" Rubio took his firmest stance against the concept that people can affect the environment in 2010, telling the Tampa Tribune ahead of the election that he didn't ""think there's the scientific evidence to justify it."" He won that election and has served in the U.S. Senate for more than a decade. Throughout his early years in Congress, Rubio opposed environmental legislation spearheaded by former President Barack Obama. ""I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it,"" he said on ABC News' ""This Week"" in 2014. ""And I do not believe that the laws that they propose we pass will do anything about it. Except it will destroy our economy."" We rated Rubio's claim about human activity not contributing to climate change False. At other times, Rubio skirted the question without outright denying the human role. ""Sure, the climate is changing,"" Rubio said at a Republican presidential debate on March 10, 2016. ""There was never a time when the climate was not changing."" At the debate, he did not acknowledge human contribution to climate change. By 2018, Rubio began saying in public remarks that humans, to some degree, have contributed to climate change. His comments came after Hurricane Michael devastated the Florida Panhandle and drew national media attention.  In an interview with CBS' John Dickerson, Rubio said: ""My view is climate, sea level rise, these are measurable things. You can measure that. So there, it's not even a scientific debate at some point, it's just a reality debate."" Dickerson pressed Rubio further on whether he thought humans were the chief contributor to climate change, to which Rubio said, ""That's what a lot of scientists say."" But Rubio noted that a few scientists ""dispute what percentage"" can be attributed to humans.  PolitiFact has examined similar attempts to minimize humans' role in climate change. We found that increased levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases can cause the Earth to warm. Humans have increased the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by nearly 50% since 1750, according to NASA.  Rubio's campaign also pointed to two op-eds Rubio wrote for USA Today in 2019. In the first op-ed, he acknowledged that ""Earth's climate is changing."" In the second op-ed, he encouraged ""proactive adaptation,"" which he said ""could reduce damage caused by climate change.""  He also joined the bipartisan Senate Climate Solutions Caucus in February 2020. ""Changes in our climate, such as the rise of sea levels, are measurable facts,"" Rubio said in a press release. ""I look forward to working with my colleagues to find real and responsible solutions in a bipartisan way."" Democrats and environmentalists have criticized Rubio's actions as ""greenwashing"" — meaning he says he supports solutions to climate change but rejects measures that would make the most impact, such as reducing carbon emissions through cap and trade. Meanwhile, Rubio has criticized Democrats' approach to climate change as an excuse for bad policies. Demings said Rubio ""has denied climate change."" For about a decade, Rubio denied or downplayed humans' role in changing or worsening the climate. In recent years, he has acknowledged that humans contribute to climate change. He isn't on board with Democratic plans to respond to the crisis, but he has shown more interest in what he calls ""responsible solutions"" to climate-related issues such as rising sea levels. Demings' claim leaves out the details of Rubio's current position",Half True,"October 11, 2022"
"""55,000 years ago the world was 2 degrees warmer Celsius than it is today.”","Former oil executive Dan Peña has made his stance on climate change clear. As far as he is concerned, it’s not an issue. As evidence of why, in May 2021 Peña told an audience the story of a visit he and his wife made to Antarctica. Scientists were drilling ice core samples to determine former Earth temperatures, he said, and one scientist described to onlookers what those samples revealed. ""‘Fifty-five thousand years ago, the world was 2 degrees warmer Celsius than it is today,’"" Peña said the scientist told him. ""And I said, ‘Well, you mean the whole world?’ And he said, ‘Yes.’ ... In the cosmos of time, it’s not a fart in the wind. In the cosmos of time in the 13.8 billion years that we’ve been on this miserable planet, it’s not a fart in the wind.""  The Earth is about 4.54 billion years old, not 13.8 billion. The first life appeared about 3.7 billion years ago. The video segment was filmed at an event hosted by London Real, a company that makes videos on self-improvement, business, finances and other topics. The notion that the Earth was 2 degrees Celsius warmer 55,000 years ago has been previously debunked by Climate Feedback, a scientific reference, but videos of Peña making this claim have continued to appear on social media including Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. Some of these posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) Teams of scientists do drill ice cores in Antarctica, including at the British Antarctic Survey and the National Science Foundation Ice Core Facility. As snow falls, it compresses, and in the Antarctic’s cold, it doesn’t thaw, even over hundreds of thousands of years. Scientists collect and study ice cores to discern information about temperatures as far back as 800,000 years ago. Tiny air bubbles trapped in the ice provide information about what the environment was like at the time, including carbon dioxide concentrations.  Bethan Davies, a senior researcher at the School of Geography, Politics and Sociology at Newcastle University in England, told PolitiFact in an email that she knows of no reputable source that claims Earth temperatures were higher 55,000 years ago. ""It shows a solid misunderstanding of Earth’s palaeoclimate and the drivers of past temperature change,"" said Davies, who also runs AntarcticGlaciers.org, a website about the study of glaciation and the Antarctic. The temperature in one studied region of Antarctica was -35.6°C 55,000 years ago, according to data published in 2016 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It said that in 2006, the average temperature in that area of Antarctica was -28.7°C — that was about 6.9°C warmer than the temperature in that region 55,000 years ago.  There is also data about the Northern Hemisphere going back 120,000 years that shows it was colder 55,000 years ago in Greenland, too.  To visualize Earth’s climate 55,000 years ago, note that this was the time of wooly mammoths. This would have been during a period of slight warming compared with the rest of that glacial period, but it was not warmer than today, Davies says.  There are periods in Earth’s history in which the planet was much warmer than today, or even too hot for humans to live. For instance, 600 million to 800 million years ago, long before the dinosaurs, the global average temperature was 90° Fahrenheit (32°C) as opposed to the 20th-century global average, which was about 57° F (14°C) according to modern measurements by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The global average of 2021 was 1.51°F (0.84° Celsius) warmer than that, according to NOAA’s 2021 report on average land and sea temperature. However, that there have been gradual periods of warming in the past doesn’t mean that climate change is a hoax, normal, or safe. Although the Earth’s temperature has fluctuated, both in deep time and over the last century, the speed at which the climate is changing affects ""water, energy, transportation, wildlife, agriculture, ecosystems, and human health,"" according to NOAA. Even natural climate variations are disruptive, as temperatures, sea-level changes, and other phenomena result in changes to the atmosphere and weather, as well as extinctions of plants and animals. Human-driven change is of particular concern, though, as human activity is happening at rates the United Nations calls ""unprecedented"" and ""irreversible"" for centuries or millennia, too fast for the natural world and human society to safely adapt.  A video circulating on Facebook showed Peña saying Antarctic ice cores show the Earth was 2 degrees Celsius warmer 55,000 years ago. Scientific research looking at the Southern and Northern hemispheres shows that assertion is wrong. Although the planet’s temperatures have fluctuated over billions of years, research published in 2016 shows the Antarctic was 6.9°C colder compared with 2006, the most recent year for which ice core data has been collected",False,"October 10, 2022"
"Kamala Harris said about Hurricane Ian that “if you have a different skin color, you're going to get relief faster.”","After Hurricane Ian made landfall in both southwest Florida and  South Carolina, an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris stirred up its own storm. Harris was speaking with actress Priyanka Chopra Jonas on Sept. 30 before the Democratic National Committee's Women's Leadership Forum in Washington, D.C. She paused to listen as Chopra Jonas spent a minute and 12 seconds asking a winding series of questions about Hurricane Ian relief efforts, the Biden administration’s climate efforts in the U.S. and the global implications of climate change.  ""I’m gonna unpack that question,"" Harris responded with a laugh, before giving a more-than-five-minute answer that touched on a number of topics, including Hurricane Ian, the Biden administration’s climate policies and disparities among those harmed by climate change. But conservatives, including Florida Sen. Rick Scott, seized on a shortened, out-of-context clip of Harris’ answer to make it seem as if Harris said federal storm relief would be based solely on race and equity.  Scott, a Republican, claimed on CBS’ ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday that Harris said relief would be ""faster"" if you ""have a different skin color."" Host Margaret Brennan said ""disasters are a time when people can come together"" and asked Scott about what she described as ""disturbing rhetoric"" from former President Donald Trump and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. Brennan asked Scott whether he rebuked those comments, but he focused on Harris instead. ""I think what we got to do is we got to bring everybody together,"" Scott said. ""I'd also say that what Vice President Harris said yesterday or the day before yesterday, that, you know if you have a different skin color, you're going to get relief faster, that’s not helpful either."" When Brennan said that wasn’t what Harris had said, Scott shot back, ""That's exactly what she meant.""  We reached out to Scott’s office for evidence to back his claim but have not heard back. Harris’ comments made the rounds on social media and conservative news outlets such as Fox News and The Daily Caller before Scott’s TV appearance. Conservative activist Ryan Fournier said in a tweet that Harris ""said the administration will be giving hurricane resources ‘based on equity’ by directing funds to ‘communities of color.’"" Fournier’s post received more than a million video views and responses from high-profile people like Elon Musk and Christina Pushaw with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ re-election campaign.

There’s an unlimited supply of water being generated “deep within the Earth.”,"Climate change has resulted in drier and hotter weather around the world. It has exacerbated a growing water crisis that experts say puts drought-prone areas at risk for longer and more severe water shortages. But a recent Instagram video implies there’s nothing to worry about. Earth is generating an unlimited supply of water, a man floating in a lake says in the video. ""There’s water deep within the Earth, which is always coming up all the time, and is the combination of hydrogen and oxygen to create water, so that we have unlimited water,"" the man says as he bobs while wearing a personal floatation device.  ""We get fooled because we think that because it stops raining that we’re running out of water — but that’s actually the secondary water cycle … So it can have the illusion that we’re running out of water. But in reality water is coming out of the Earth 24/7, 365 (days a year), when hydrogen and oxygen are mixing together to come up through the water veins right up into the earth."" The Instagram post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Instagram is owned by Facebook’s parent company, Meta. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The video oversimplifies the complexity of the Earth’s water supply and the reasons scientists warn about a water crisis in some parts of the globe. Hydrogen and oxygen do combine to make water. And there is water underground in the form of groundwater, but it’s not being spontaneously created, as the video claims.  Greg Pierce, co-director of the Water Resources Group at the University of California, Los Angeles, and an adjunct assistant professor in its urban planning department, said the video’s overall message is wrong in its understanding of how water works. Groundwater occurs when the water from rain or melted snow and ice is absorbed into the soil and stored in small spaces between rocks and other sediment, according to an explainer from the Environmental Protection Agency. An aquifer can form underground, storing water that can then be pumped out for use. Sources of groundwater can be found between 10 feet underground to several thousands of feet underground. Pierce said there is plentiful, untapped water deep underground. But it’s not realistic to suggest that it’s simply there for the taking.. Not only would it be prohibitively expensive to drill to the deepest sources of groundwater in the Earth, but also the technology  to do so isn’t available. ""Going beyond even five hundred feet is costly. And if you go beyond a few thousand, which is where most of the water that’s ‘untapped’ is, we barely have the technology,"" he said. ""There are also some concerns around destabilizing (the geology of an area) if you extract at depths that are too low."" Water is being constantly circulated on the planet from the ground to the atmosphere, and back again, as part of the hydrologic cycle. Pierce said the main concern regarding the global water supply stems from the fact that water is being extracted from aquifers faster than it can be replenished. Scientists call this ""overdraft,"" and it impacts the amount of water available at a specific place at a specific time.  It’s unknown where Earth’s water originated, but the widely accepted scientific theory is that the planet was struck by asteroids and comets containing ice billions of years ago. Some sources of groundwater have been built over millions of years, so it would take an equivalent amount of time before it is replenished, Pierce said. Overdraft has led to many aquifers becoming smaller. ""We’re actually collapsing the storage of the aquifer basin where that water was held,"" Pierce said. ""If you over-extract, it collapses and becomes narrower so you can’t store as much water."" Norman Miller, a UC Berkeley adjunct professor in geography, said climate change has affected groundwater availability.  Since the start of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-1700s, the Earth has experienced rising temperatures. That creates more water vapor in the atmosphere. ""The net result is dry regions become drier and wet regions become wetter, with more intense precipitation when it does precipitate,"" Miller said. Miller said there’s no ""deep water emerging magically"" from the Earth. A video claims the world isn’t running out of water because an unlimited supply is being constantly generated underneath the Earth’s surface. While there is water underground, it’s not being spontaneously generated. It’s the result of rainfall and melted snow and ice seeping into soil and being stored in aquifers. Water is constantly being circulated across the Earth, going from the atmosphere to the surface and back again. Climate change and over-extracting from an aquifer have an impact on the availability of groundwater in a specific region at a specific time, but it doesn’t mean the world is running out of water. Drier areas are predicted to become drier as a result of less rainfall, while wet areas become wetter because of an increase in rain",Mostly False,"September 7, 2022"
"Joe Biden and Raphael Warnock ""are spending $1.5 billion on ‘urban forestry’ and raising taxes on those making under $200k to pay for it.”","In Georgia’s closely watched Senate race, Herschel Walker, the Republican challenger to Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, keeps circling back to a subject rarely discussed in political campaigns: trees. It began at Walker’s Aug. 21 campaign appearance, when he said of Democrats, ""They continue to try to fool you that they are helping you out, but they’re not. Because a lot of money, it’s going to trees. Don’t we have enough trees around here?"" Herschel Walker on the federal climate change bill: “They continue to try to fool you that they are helping you out. But they’re not. Because a lot of money it’s going to trees. Don’t we have enough trees around here?” #gapol #gasen  https://t.co/1HpulYTJl4 The following day, Walker doubled down, saying in a tweet, ""Yes, you heard me right … Joe Biden and @ReverendWarnock are spending $1.5 billion on ‘urban forestry’ and raising taxes on those making under $200k to pay for it. Yes, I have a problem with that."" Yes, you heard me right…Joe Biden and @ReverendWarnock are spending $1.5 billion on “urban forestry” and raising taxes on those making under $200k to pay for it. Yes, I have a problem with that. Walker was referring to the Inflation Reduction Act recently signed by President Joe Biden. He accurately represented the amount of money allocated to support urban tree cover in the Inflation Reduction Act. But his assertion that the effort is being funded by ""raising taxes on those making under"" $200,000 is misleading, since the analysis that drew that conclusion didn’t take into account the savings to Americans from other parts of the bill. When PolitiFact contacted him for this article, Walker said through his campaign, ""Our inner cities need less crime, not more trees."" It wasn’t long ago when a large majority of Republicans indicated they supported tree-planting efforts. A 2020 survey by the Pew Research Center found that 88% of Republicans supported planting about a trillion trees to absorb carbon emissions, which scientists say would help arrest climate change.  Also in 2020, President Donald Trump noted in his State of the Union address that he had worked to make sure the U.S. joined the World Economic Forum’s One Trillion Trees planting initiative. And House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., co-sponsored the One Trillion Trees Act along with 33 other House Republicans. (It did not advance.) More recently, though, Republicans and GOP-aligned groups have used trees as a rhetorical punching bag. In August, the group Citizens Against Government Waste ran a Facebook ad that ridiculed spending in the Inflation Reduction Act on such ""wasteful"" efforts as ""‘tree equity,’ ‘clean’ garbage trucks and studying cow farts."" The new law allocates $1.5 billion to the U.S. Forest Service’s Urban and Community Forestry program, which averages to $150 million a year over the bill's 10-year life. That’s a substantial cash infusion for the program, which has been funded at around $30 million to $40 million per year for the past few years, said Matt Spitsen, program development manager for the Arbor Day Foundation, which promotes tree planting.  Walker said the legislation would raise ""taxes on those making under $200k."" But the tax provisions in the measure are aimed at wealthy money managers and big companies. One of the law’s two major tax elements would significantly scale back a tax-code provision known as ""carried interest,"" which allows money managers to pay taxes on much of their income at capital-gains rates, which are lower than the regular rates for personal income. The other provision would require companies reporting at least $1 billion in profits to pay at least 15% in corporate income taxes, which many currently do not do. An analysis by the congressional bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation found the law would raise taxes, on average, in every income bracket. Overall, the federal tax burden for all Americans would rise by an average of 1.4% in 2023, and by less in future years. For those earning between $30,000 and $100,000, the increase would be less than 1% in 2023.  But there’s an important caveat: The joint committee analysis looked only at the tax side of the bill, not at spending provisions that could offset those tax increases for most families. The latter includes tax credits for people who buy electric vehicles and implement energy-efficiency improvements; multiyear subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act; and a drug-negotiation provision for Medicare. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget concluded that the $64 billion in health insurance subsidies alone ""would be more than enough"" to erase the tax increases for people earning less than $400,000 under the Joint Commission on Taxation’s analysis.  The funding for trees is to be used ""for tree planting and related activities, with a priority for projects that benefit underserved populations and areas,"" according to the bill.  Before the bill’s passage, the U.S. Forest Service program’s budget was spent largely on placing staff in every state to support local urban foresters. The new, expanded budget will allow the program to award grants to local nonprofits seeking to improve tree cover in their geographic areas, Spitsen said. The idea is to ""help cities plant more trees in the places where they're needed most,"" said Jad Daley, president and CEO of the advocacy group American Forests. The national program’s focus on racial and economic justice seeks to direct the bill’s funding to neighborhoods that are low-income and relatively treeless.  ""Across the nation, on average, the lowest-income neighborhoods in America have 41% less tree cover than the wealthiest neighborhoods,"" Daley said. And neighborhoods where a majority of residents are people of color have 33% less tree cover on average, he said. ""Essentially, shade and cooling is distributed according to race and income,"" he said. A jet comes in for approach over downtown Phoenix as temperatures exceed 100 degrees in the morning hours. Phoenix officials are planting thousands of trees to lower temperatures. (AP) Supporters cite several benefits from expanding tree cover. One major benefit is reducing mortality from heat. Between 1999 and 2010, 8,081 people died in the United States from heat-related deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About three-quarters of those deaths were primarily because of heat, and in the rest, heat was a contributing factor.  That’s about five times the number of deaths from hurricanes over the same period, even counting the unusually high death toll from Hurricane Katrina in 2005. And it was about 12 times the number of deaths from tornadoes over the same period. More recent data from a University of Pennsylvania study found even higher numbers for heat-related deaths: an estimated 13,000 to 20,000 between 2008 and 2017. ""The allocation of funds to tree planting in cities can have an immense impact on heat risk,"" said Brian Stone Jr., an urban environmental planning and design professor at Georgia Institute of Technology. Stone said his research found that in combination with other strategies, planting trees in Atlanta ""can reduce heat-wave mortality by more than 20%."" Trees also ease carbon levels in the atmosphere. Trees, like all plants, store and immobilize carbon dioxide, which is a key driver of climate change. Daley said it’s estimated that 130 million metric tons per year of carbon dioxide are being stored in trees and forests. ""So it's a really big slice of the natural climate solution,"" he said. Tree-planting is ""a meaningful contribution to actually pull carbon dioxide out of the air."" Finally, trees help save money on cooling. Research published by the U.S. Forest Service suggests that, on average, urban trees and forests help decrease residential electricity use by 7.2% annually. That produces savings in utility costs and also reduces emissions from power generation.  Walker said, Biden and Warnock ""are spending $1.5 billion on ‘urban forestry’ and raising taxes on those making under $200k to pay for it."" Walker is correct about the amount being spent on efforts to bolster urban tree cover, but he exaggerated when he said the bill will ""raise taxes"" on middle- and lower-income Americans.  Analyses that reached that conclusion looked only at the tax provisions in the bill. The spending provisions could offset those increases, or surpass them, by saving Americans money on green improvements, Affordable Care Act premiums and prescription drug costs",Half True,"September 1, 2022"
“The Earth just started spinning faster than ever before and scientists are gravely concerned.”,"Twenty-four hours is hardly enough time in a day, but now the internet says the days are getting shorter! Are scientists worried? Should you be worried? Several posts on Facebook, mostly posted Aug. 7 on meme pages, have stated that the Earth ""just started spinning faster and scientists are gravely concerned.""  The claim was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We wondered if either part of the statement was true.  First: Yes, on June 29, 2022, the official length of day was 1.59 milliseconds shorter than 24 hours. That’s the fastest the Earth has ever spun since we started keeping track with precision of atomic clocks. However, that’s ""nothing out of the ordinary,"" according to a press release from NASA. According to Wolfgang Dick, a spokesman for the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service, it’s inaccurate to suggest there was anything sudden about this change. ""(T)his fluctuation is quite normal,"" wrote Dick to PolitiFact in an email.  The International Earth Rotation and Systems Service, based in Frankfurt, Germany, maintains global time and reference frame standards. Several things can affect the rotation of the Earth and, thus, its spin speed, including a slight wobble of the Earth on its axis, called the Chandler wobble. The moon stabilizes the Earth’s wobble to some extent. According to Forbes, possible reasons that the Earth spun faster in June include seismic activity, changes in the Earth’s core, and polar ice caps melting.  Second: Are scientists ""gravely concerned?""  We contacted Leonid Zotov, an associate professor at the National Research University Higher School of Economics in Moscow and senior researcher at Sternberg Astronomical Institute, Lomonosov Moscow State University, who recently presented his paper on Earth’s changing rotation.  ""The changes in Earth's rotation are quite small, at the level of milliseconds,"" he told us. ""The(y) cannot make any harm."" He also noted that the Earth changes the speed at which it spins regularly over the course of a year, going slightly faster in the summer, with no detrimental effects.  Still, Zotov describes these changes as ""really interesting."" ""There are correlations with climate anomalies,"" he wrote. ""My personal belie(f) is that this year's drafts and such events as La Niña in (the) central Pacific could be related to acceleration in our planet's rotation.""  With enough sped-up days, we might need to add a ""negative leap second."" As a leap day amounts to adding a day to a year, a negative leap second would subtract one second from the time. But changing official calendars can be complicated and isn’t always harmless. For example, a leap second added in 2012 crashed several websites, including Reddit.  It’s true that the Earth spun slightly faster on June 29, 2022 — 1.59 milliseconds faster than usual. Facebook posts suggested this means Earth is now continuously spinning faster, at a pace so significant that scientists are worried.  But 1.59 milliseconds isn’t significantly outside of expectations. There is no evidence to suggest this should pose a danger to anyone on Earth, so scientists are not ""gravely concerned",Half True,"August 31, 2022"
“96% of U.S. climate data is corrupted.”,"Global temperatures are rising, and there is ample evidence to support that fact. But that hasn’t stopped some people from claiming they’ve found proof that climate change concerns are overblown. An article circulating on Facebook claims that U.S. agencies’ use of flawed data exaggerates the severity of climate change. ""96% of U.S. climate data is corrupted,"" reads the headline of one July 27 blog post from the Heartland Institute, a conservative think tank. ""Official NOAA temperature stations produce corrupted data due to purposeful placement in man-made hot spots,"" the blog post said, referring to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Heartland Institute cited a report it paid for and produced. That report analyzed a small sample of 128 temperature stations out of several thousand volunteer-run stations and found that 96% of them failed to meet NOAA placement recommendations. It appears those findings were extrapolated to conclude that the placement of these temperature stations ""strongly undermines"" the legitimacy and magnitude of long-term climate change trends. ""The correct approach is to write a scientific paper and submit it to a scientific journal,"" said Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist currently serving as research lead at Stripe, a San Francisco-based technology company. ""In this specific case, the author of the report, Anthony Watts, submitted a paper on the topic around 10 years ago, but was unable to successfully convince other scientists of the validity of his findings and to pass the peer review process."" Donald J. Wuebbles, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Illinois, characterized Watts as a ""well-known climate denialist."" With that in mind, we set out to learn more about data collection and climate change. Scientists, volunteers and automated instruments collect climate data such as air chemistry, temperature, precipitation and wind speed, according to NOAA. Instruments carried on balloons can provide data from points more than 10 miles high. Satellites track temperature, winds and clouds.  NOAA and the National Weather Service have two programs that monitor weather conditions in the U.S., said Robert Rohde, lead scientist at Berkeley Earth, a Berkeley, California, organization providing global temperature data.  One program, the Cooperative Observer Program (COOP), relies on more than 8,700 volunteers who record daily temperature data using weather monitoring equipment.  The other program is a network of about 900 more sophisticated, automated weather stations often set up in connection with airports or weather bureaus, Rohde said. The standards for installing those stations are more rigorous than Cooperative Observer Program stations, he said.  The Heartland report looks exclusively at 128 COOP stations of thousands. Rohde said that ""immediately undermined"" its conclusion that 96% of climate data is corrupt. It is unclear how those stations were selected.   According to National Weather Service instructions, COOP stations should be installed over level terrain at least 100 feet from ""any extensive concrete or paved surface,"" and should not be placed where water or drifting snow collects.  Rohde said that some COOP stations are closer than recommended to structures, artificial surfaces or vegetation. ""In the worst cases, local impediments may greatly disturb the temperature readings reported,"" he said, resulting in temperature readings ""dominated by the surfaces and other features in the immediate vicinity of the sensor.""  The Heartland report argued that such temperature stations, which might be placed near structures or parking lots, resulted in corrupted data.  But that allegation ignores key facts. First, climate scientists know that weather station data can be impacted by poor siting, and they adjust data accordingly. Second, climate change analysis focuses on changes over time. ""Siting problems often cause the station to be consistently a bit too hot, or too cold, but that bias often remains more or less uniform over time,"" Rohde said. ""In such cases, it may still be possible to estimate trends related to climate change even if the observations themselves are not ideal."" Research has not proved that poor station siting results in biased conclusions, however. A 2013 study found that the network of stations can provide reliable data on temperature trends even when stations rated ""poor"" are included. NOAA spokesperson John Bateman told PolitiFact the agency has known about the concerns caused by problematic station sites for decades, and it has ""developed techniques to account for and correct these potential problems."" The Heartland Institute told PolitiFact that its conclusions were valid because experts did not disagree that some COOP stations are at sites that fail to meet NOAA’s quality recommendations. The group argued that because of those stations, any methods used to adjust the data and remove bias would ""actually make the problem worse."" In 2009, NOAA acknowledged that the placement of a number of temperature stations did not follow National Weather Service siting recommendations. Still, a peer-reviewed 2006 study that sought to evaluate the potential bias caused by poor station locations ""found no bias in long-term trends,"" NOAA said. That study evaluated a small subset of data, so its conclusions had limitations.  Researchers account for temperature station locations and measurement times, said Mark Richardson, a research scientist at the California Institute of Technology’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory who studies climate change. ""So, even if a thermometer is in a warmer place, like a city, the effect of the local warmth is filtered out to prevent it from affecting trends."" NOAA publishes U.S. weather station data online, and groups such as Berkeley Earth, NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, the United Kingdom’s Met Office and the Japan Meteorological Agency use it to build climate records. ""The independent groups all agree about the pattern of U.S. and global temperature changes,"" Richardson said.  Since 1880, average global temperature has increased by at least 1.9 degrees Fahrenheit (or 1.1 degrees Celsius), according to Goddard Institute for Space Studies’ temperature analysis. By way of comparison, Richardson said that the Earth cooled about 4 to 6 degrees Celsius tens of thousands of years ago and a nearly 4 kilometer thick mass of ice known as the Laurentide ice sheet spread over Canada and reached parts of the U.S.   Awesome visualization and a much-needed update to Laurentide Ice Sheet margins thru time! https://t.co/RUxxFhrI1k ""The warming rates we are living through are truly astonishing for Earth, even if they feel slow day to day,"" Richardson said.

A headline on Facebook claimed ""96% of U.S. climate data is corrupted"" because the NOAA’s temperature stations were purposefully placed ""in man-made hot spots.""  Although some temperature stations are not placed in ideal conditions, experts said they are there to provide a consistent historical record and added that the data is evaluated and adjusted for biases.  There is widespread consensus that annual global average temperatures are rising, experts said",False,"August 19, 2022"
Says Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson “called climate change ‘bull----’ during a record heatwave” and “raked in over $700k in fossil fuel cash.”,"With passage by Democrats of a new measure aimed squarely at tackling climate change, the issue is taking on a new urgency in the fall election. Those who opposed the measure, including U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., are being targeted by environmental groups and others. That includes the claim of using an expletive to dismiss climate change, and pulling in campaign money from oil and gas companies. In an Aug. 13, 2022, tweet, the League of Conservation Voters took aim at Johnson, saying he ""called climate change ‘bull - - - -’ during a record heatwave"" and ""raked in over $700k in fossil fuel cash."" Let’s take a closer look at both parts of that claim.  Caught on camera  So did Johnson make light of climate change?  While speaking to the Republican Women of Greater Wisconsin on June 5, 2021, Johnson’s speech did, in fact, turn to climate change.  ""I don’t know about you guys, but I think climate change — as Lord Monckton said — bull - - - -,"" Johnson said, based on a video of the luncheon. He was referring to Lord Christopher Monckton, a noted British climate change skeptic, and mouthed the expletive before adding aloud: ""By the way, it is.""  Legions of scientists have researched climate change and determined it is real, with its impact seen in heat waves and drought in some areas, and rising sea levels in others.  When asked later about his comments by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Johnson tried to soften the remark a bit, saying that he is not a climate change denier, nor is he a climate change alarmist.  ""Climate is not static,"" he said. ""It has always changed and always will change.""  But the bottomline: Yes, Johnson was caught on video referring to climate change that way.  So, what about the second part of the tweet? Exactly how much has Johnson gotten from the oil and gas industry?  When we asked for backup for the claim, David Willett, senior vice president of communications for the League of Conservation Voters, said the information came from OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan nonprofit research group that tracks money in politics.  According to OpenSecrets, Johnson has taken $753,247 from the oil and gas industry since 2009. That period covers Johnson’s entire tenure in office, since he first won election in 2010. The site does not further break down how that money was spent on Johnson. It doesn’t say whether the money was directly contributed to Johnson’s campaign or whether other groups spent it on his behalf, such as for ads against opponents during an election.  Included in the donors to Johnson is Koch Industries, which does some work in the oil and gas industry. Donors affiliated with the company have contributed about $67,000.  As a point of reference, Johnson is far from the top recipient of donations by the industry.  U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, has received more than $8 million in donations during his time in office, while U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, has taken over $4.1 million.  In fact, Johnson doesn’t even crack the top 20 recipients in Congress of oil and gas industry donations, according to OpenSecrets. Neither is the oil and gas industry the largest contributor to Johnson, according to OpenSecrets. Over the years, securities and investment, real estate and manufacturing have been some of the largest industry donors. The League of Conservation Voters claimed Johnson ""called climate change ‘bull - - - -’  during a record heatwave"" and ""raked in over $700k in fossil fuel cash."" Both parts of the claim check out, from a much-publicized comment made at a luncheon in 2021 to publicly available campaign contributions, as organized and analyzed by a reputable nonpartisan group.  Indeed, Johnson has actually received more than $750,000 from the oil, gas and energy industry since the 2010 election, though it’s far from his biggest source of money — and he’s far from the top recipients in Congress",True,"August 19, 2022"
"""Bill Gates and AOC say that a cow emits more pollution than a car.""","Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., have talked in the past about the pressing need for governments and corporations to take climate change seriously, including the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the agriculture industry. One Facebook post took this a step further by claiming the two said ""a cow emits more pollution than a car."" The post features an image of Gates and Ocasio-Cortez with a cartoon illustration of a cow. Underneath the image is text that makes a reference to using an idling car in an enclosed space for carbon monoxide poisoning. ""How bout I spend the night in a garage with a cow, and they spend the night in a garage with a running car,"" text underneath the image reads. ""Then we can meet up the next morning to discuss."" Variations of the claim have popped up elsewhere on social media. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The emissions coming from a cow and those from a car are not one in the same. A cow produces methane gas when partially digested food like grass is fermented within the rumen, one of a cow’s four stomach compartments. That gas is built up during fermentation and expelled by the cow through belching and, occasionally, flatulence. Cars with internal combustion engines primarily produce carbon dioxide as a byproduct when fuel is burned to provide energy. A single cow will expel an average of 220 pounds of methane per year, according to the University of California, Davis. Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency reports that a typical car will emit an average of 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. Methane gas is nearly 30 times more potent than carbon dioxide when it comes to contributing to climate change, UC Davis reports. Despite methane's potency, it only lasts for about 12 years in the atmosphere before a majority of it is removed through oxidation. Experts at UC Davis theorize that it’s possible the amount of methane that cows emit into the atmosphere is the same as the amount that breaks down. As for carbon dioxide, the university said it can last anywhere from several hundred to a thousand years in the Earth's atmosphere before breaking down. Meaning the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will continue to build up more and more in the atmosphere and will take centuries before disappearing. There are an estimated 253 million passenger cars and trucks within the U.S., with about 1.8 million of them being electric powered. The U.S. has around 91.9 million head of cattle.  A spokesperson for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation told PolitiFact Gates has never said anything about cows producing more pollution than cars. Although a representative for Ocasio-Cortez’s office did not return a request for comment, we could not find any public remarks or written statements similar to the claim in the Facebook post made by the congresswoman. However, both have talked in the past about the link between the agriculture industry and climate change. Gates published a research paper in October 2021 detailing the need to make green technologies more affordable and accessible than their carbon-emitting counterparts. He mentioned in the report that livestock contributed 6% of global greenhouse gas emissions while passenger cars emitted 7%. Gates has also previously talked about the possibility of developed nations transitioning entirely to eating synthetic beef to help reduce the need for livestock, thereby lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Ocasio-Cortez briefly came under fire in 2019 when an FAQ shared by her office regarding the Green New Deal, a proposed resolution she co-sponsored to help address climate change, included a line about ""farting cows."" ""We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast,"" the FAQ said. The mention of ""farting cows"" did not appear in the resolution itself. The resolution also mentioned the need to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, but makes no comparison to the emission of cars with those of cows. Similar to Gates, Ocasio-Cortez has also advocated for the need to eat less meat and dairy products as a way to help address climate change. She’s made statements about it on social media and in an interview on the canceled Showtime series ""Desus & Mero."" ""It’s not to say you get rid of agriculture. It’s not to say we’re going to force everybody to go vegan or anything crazy like that,"" she said on the show. ""But it’s to say, listen, we’ve got to address factory farming. Maybe we shouldn’t be eating a hamburger for breakfast, lunch and dinner."" A Facebook post claims Gates Ocasio-Cortez said cows emitted more pollution than cars. Although both have talked about climate change in the past and the roles that fossil fuels and livestock play in greenhouse gas emissions, neither have said anything resembling the claim in the Facebook post. The methane emitted by cows is more potent in contributing to climate change, but it breaks down in the atmosphere considerably more quickly than the carbon dioxide from cars",False,"August 15, 2022"
Electric cars in California are not sustainable as only 10% of their batteries are recyclable and the state can’t recycle them.,"As part of his $10 billion zero-emission vehicle plan to fight climate change, California Gov. Gavin Newsom wants to phase out gasoline-powered cars in favor of electric powered ones by 2035. And President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, passed Aug. 7 by the U.S. Senate, would give Americans a tax credit of up to $7,500 to defray the cost of buying an electric vehicle. But an Instagram post claims difficulty with recycling lithium-ion batteries, the fuel cells in electric vehicles, will render this push toward zero-emission vehicles impractical. A video posted June 9 and shared by others features a woman talking about California officials advocating for more renewable energy and for residents to drive electric cars. The woman makes several claims, including that the push for more electric cars is not a ""sustainable solution"" as there isn’t a plant in California that can recycle their batteries once they die. ""There’s only three (electric car battery recycling plants) in the United States, and they can only recycle about 10% of the materials, which means the balance will go into landfills,"" she says. ""This could do more damage to our planet in a matter of 10 years than fossil fuels have done in 100 years."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Instagram is owned by Facebook’s parent company, Meta. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) While the woman was right in saying California doesn't have a plant dedicated to recycling electric car batteries, the situation isn't as dire as she claimed. The woman was also wrong in her statement about the recyclability of lithium-ion car batteries.  Most electric car batteries last at least 100,000 miles before their ability to hold a charge seriously degrades, according to Carfax. With Americans driving an average of 13,476 miles each year, that translates to at least seven years of reliable service. Most batteries will go for significantly longer than the initial 100,000 miles before dying. The first major wave of electric car batteries dying off is expected to happen within the next 10 to 15 years, the BBC reported. Unlike lead-acid batteries, which are small and easily recyclable, electric cars use battery packs that are larger and composed of hundreds of individual lithium-ion batteries. The hazardous materials within a battery pack can spark a fire or explode if handled or disposed of incorrectly. Also, California lacks an electric car battery recycling plant; there are only five such facilities currently operating in the U.S. However, Alissa Kendall, a UC Davis civil and environmental engineering professor, told PolitiFact that California not having a recycling facility was a ""particularly irrelevant"" point, as there are ""many things we recycle or process in the U.S. economy that don’t have a site in every state."" Kendall said Nevada-based Redwood Materials launched an electric car battery recycling program in California in February and partnered with California car dealerships and battery dismantlers to collect lithium-ion batteries. The batteries will be sent to Redwood’s recycling facility in Nevada. Kendall was the lead author of a California Environmental Protection Agency report in May that said electric car battery recycling was a relatively new, but growing industry.The report also made several recommendations to the California Legislature for improving  electric car battery recycling. Meanwhile, there are several ways  to recycle electric car batteries, all of which reclaim significantly more material than the 10% the Instagram video cited. One method is through smelting, which melts a battery down at a high temperature until its materials separate from one another. Because this method requires a lot of greenhouse gas-producing energy but recovers only about 40% to 50% of a battery’s material, it’s less widely used, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported.. The other two recycling methods, which are more widely used, involve shredding lithium-ion batteries into small pieces. A shredded battery can be recycled directly, by removing and separating its parts by hand, or through hydrometallurgy, in which the batteries' pieces are submerged in a solution and chemically separated. These shredding methods can recover up to 90% to 95% of a battery’s components. Kendall said lithium-ion batteries’ worst-case environmental impact  would still be less than  fossil fuels’.  ""While we certainly can improve mining practices and recycling systems for every material and product in our economy, there are very few measures whereby oil and gas extraction and refining are less harmful than lithium extraction (for electric car batteries),"" she said. A woman in an Instagram video claims California’s push for electric cars is not sustainable in part because California does not have a recycling facility that can handle the lithium-ion batteries in cars and that the recycling facilities in the country can recycle only 10% of the batteries’ material.  While California so far has no lithium-ion battery recycling plant, the California Environmental Protection Agency report said lithium-ion battery recycling is still a fairly new industry with room for growth. Also, companies from other states are partnering with California to recycle its batteries. Furthermore, current recycling methods can recover from half to up to 95% of the material used lithium-ion batteries, far more than the post’s claim of a 10% recovery rate",False,"August 11, 2022"
Photo shows electric cars that were bought for civil servants in France and then abandoned because “it was too expensive to replace the batteries.”,"A photo of dozens of cars parked snugly in a field is getting, shall we say, traffic on social media as users share this description of the image: ""This is France. They bought electric cars for civil servants. But it was too expensive to replace the batteries. And THIS is the Green New Plan to save our country.""   A reverse image search of the photo turned up many unsourced blog posts, as well as fact-checks from when this picture was circulating online more than a year ago.  The upshot: this photo was taken in China, not France, and it doesn’t show the former vehicles of French civil servants that were dumped because the car batteries died.  A post sharing the image was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In the photograph, Chinese license plates can be seen, as can a watermark in the image’s bottom right corner crediting a photographer who goes by the name Greg Abandoned. The photographer posted the picture on his Instagram account on June 19, 2021. He photographs abandoned things and places in China and elsewhere around the world, and a similar image to the one being shared on Facebook is the cover of his book, ""Abandoned China,"" which he describes on his website as ""an album of pictures and stories from abandoned locations, collected from over 3 years of exploring in China from 2018 to 2021."" Though his Instagram post doesn’t identify where the cars were photographed — ""I don’t share locations, please respect that,"" the post says — news outlets have published similar pictures of the same kinds of of cars with the same buildings in the background in Hangzhou, China.  In 2019, the South China Morning Post reported that ""thousands of unused electric cars were seen parked alongside a river on the outskirts of Hangzhou"" and that they belonged to an electric car rental company called Microcity. The company is among hundreds of car-sharing companies that have emerged in China in recent years, the Morning Post said, and several such startups have since shuttered.  We found no evidence that the cars in the photo were abandoned because of the cost of replacing their batteries, as the Facebook post says. Microcity’s former brand manager, Lou Gaofeng, told Agence France-Presse in 2021 that the cars in the posted photo ""belonged to Hangzhou Microcity."" He said not all the Microcity electric cars parked in the region were defective. ""Some of them had problems, some could still be used, others were old enough to be sold to another company and disassembled."" We previously fact-checked a claim about a different photo that was described as showing a ""boneyard"" of electric cars abandoned in France because the cars’ batteries were too expensive to replace. They were vehicles that belonged to a French car-sharing service that also failed, and the cars were being resold or sold for parts",False,"August 10, 2022"
"In its July “red alert” for extreme heat, the U.K.'s Met Office warned that high temperatures could cause blood clotting.","The United Kingdom has been hot this summer — super, super hot. It’s been so hot that U.K.’s health and meteorology agencies have issued unprecedented heat warnings.  But contrary to some social media posts, these agencies have not warned that extreme heat would heighten the risk of blood clots.   Recently, an image has been making the rounds claiming that the U.K.’s Meteorological Office, a weather and climate office, has warned that temperatures in the ""high 20s and 30s Celsius"" (or 68 degrees and 86 degrees Fahrenheit) is causing blood clotting. It shows a headline from The Telegraph stating ""‘Your blood thickens and then clots:’ What extreme heat can do to your body.""  This is the social media preview headline for an article in The Telegraph, and it was previously a headline on the article itself, although now the headline is different. The image appeared on Facebook, where it was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The U.K.’s Meteorological Office, or Met Office, did issue its first-ever red extreme heat warning beacuse of temperature forecasts of 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and above. Red is the highest-level warning for the Met office, indicating it is ""very likely that there will be a risk to life, with substantial disruption to travel, energy supplies and possibly widespread damage to property and infrastructure."" However, PolitiFact found no Met statements that mentioned blood clots. A press representative at the Met Office wrote in an email to PolitiFact: ""I’m not aware of any claims we made about blood clots ourselves, but they might be getting slightly confused with the U.K. Health Security Agency Level 4 Warning — which would have spoken more about potential health impacts (as it’s designed for the health industry)."" But the Level 4 alert from the Health Security Agency doesn’t mention blood clots, either.  Cardiovascular diseases and respiratory illnesses are among the more common causes of death from excessive heat; however, dehydration, heat exhaustion and heatstroke are bigger concerns overall. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls heatstroke ""the most serious heat-related illness."" That said, there was some truth in the initial headline of the Telegraph article captured in the screenshot. Although the headline ""your blood thickens and clots"" was framed in a way that sounds absolute, heat does sometimes cause blood clots, including fatal ones. In 2017, the American Heart Association published a study about the danger of heat waves. Dr. Camilo Mora, lead author on the study and professor of geography and the environment at the University of Hawaii, Manoa, confirmed that heat waves can and do cause fatal blood clots. ""Perishing during a heatwave is like a slow torture with 27 endings to choose from,"" he wrote.  A study released May 19, 2022, analyzed excess deaths because of heat in the contiguous U.S. from 2008 to 2017. The findings state that ""each additional extreme heat day in a month was associated with (a) 0.07 additional death per 100,000 adults."" A 2014 study found that the most common excess hospital admissions during extreme heat events were for ""fluid and electrolyte disorders."" The National Institutes of Health wrote on July 21, 2022, that heat can put excess stress on the cardiovascular system, which ""can lead to a faster heart rate and an increase in inflammatory markers related to severe blood clotting."" Some people who shared or commented on these social media posts indicated they suspected a cover-up for blood clotting that is actually caused by the COVID-19 vaccines. This may be because there were rare cases of blood clots linked to the Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines, the latter of which is not approved for use in the United States. But that link is small.  Getting COVID-19 carries a risk of blood clots 8 to 10 times higher than the risk from the mRNA vaccines manufactured by Pfizer and Moderna.  According to an April 2022 report, deep vein thrombosis, particularly blood clots in the leg, occurs four times more often in COVID-19 patients (0.4%) than in the control (0.1%). About 20% of people who end up in the intensive care unit because of COVID-19 develop blood clots, which is much higher than people in the ICU for other reasons.  Social media posts claim that the U.K.’s Meteorological Office warned about blood clots with extreme heat.  While blood clots are not the most common adverse effect of extreme heat waves, they can and do happen.  However, the U.K.’s Met Office did not warn about blood clots, as that office focuses on meteorology rather than health",False,"July 29, 2022"
"""Plankton in the Atlantic Ocean is 90% gone.""","Sea life has been struggling for years because of pollution, overfishing and climate change. A now deleted Instagram post claimed the world’s oceans are in even more trouble.   The July 21 Instagram post featured an image of the ocean with superimposed text that read ""Breaking: Plankton in the Atlantic Ocean is 90% gone."" ""In what could be the most disturbing news in ocean conservation, if not human, history — data reveals worse than expected state of plankton (the foundation of life on earth) with a 90% drop in the Atlantic, driving another nail in the coffin of our dying ocean,"" the text continued. The Instagram post cited a study released by the Global Oceanic Environmental Survey Foundation, or the Goes Foundation, a Scotland research group that  measures plankton levels in the Atlantic Ocean. Howard Dryden, a marine biologist and the study’s lead author, was quoted in the Instagram post’s caption saying the Atlantic Ocean was ""pretty much dead."" Similar posts have popped up elsewhere on social media. Scientists have since questioned the study’s validity and the Goes Foundation’s data gathering methods. Dryden has said news outlets and social media have misinterpreted the study.   The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Instagram is owned by Facebook. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Plankton come in two groups: phytoplankton and zooplankton. Phytoplankton are plantlike organisms often found near the water's surface. They can absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. Zooplankton are animals that include creatures as small as krill and as large as a jellyfish. They stay in deeper waters during the daylight to avoid predators and rise up to the surface at night to feed on phytoplankton.  The Instagram post took its information and Dryden’s quote from a story about the foundation’s study in a story published July 17 by The Sunday Post, a Scottish newspaper. The Post's story originally had the headline of ""Our empty oceans: Scots team’s research finds Atlantic plankton all but wiped out in catastrophic loss of life,"" and said the study found a majority of Atlantic Ocean plankton had disappeared over two years because of pollution from toxic chemicals and microplastics. However, the article did not say that the study collected samples from a limited part of the Atlantic Ocean at 15 degrees north latitude, and that the foundation’s findings have not been peer-reviewed. Dryden told PolitiFact there was a ""breakdown in communication with The Sunday Post,"" and that the newspaper has since updated its story clarifying the scope of the foundation’s study. ""What should have been said was that there has been a 90% decline in the equatorial Atlantic, not the whole Atlantic,"" Dryden said. ""This is still a major finding, because it could mark the beginning of the spread further afield."" The Goes Foundation described its plankton and pollution survey as an ""ongoing Citizen Science project"" involving 13 sailing vessels, one manned by researchers for the foundation and 12 others crewed by sailors given monitoring equipment. The crews used custom paper filters to collect water samples. Scientists would later analyze the filters to see whether plankton were in the water. The crews involved in the survey found only a minuscule amount of plankton. Dryden said the foundation's findings ""should be verified by a second independent study,"" and that the organization is working on getting its findings peer-reviewed, although that could take two years.  He said the organization felt it had to make the information public as soon as possible because ""it is so important for the survival of the oceans and climate change."" Oceanographers and marine biologists contacted by PolitiFact disagree with the study’s methods and findings, saying they have not observed a 90% drop in plankton around the equatorial Atlantic Ocean, or anywhere else. Mark Ohman, a biological oceanographer at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, said the study ""does not even begin to meet the standards of peer-reviewed science."" He said the study’s sampling method was ""not an appropriate way to take quantitative plankton samples"" and led to unreliable results because: The study didn’t specify when and where the samples were taken in the Atlantic, which would affect how much plankton was in the water, Ohman said. And the study failed to highlight plankton’s importance in ocean food webs and in regulating the Earth’s climate and oxygenating the atmosphere, he said. ""This study makes no contribution to understanding of any of those key processes, is rife with distortion and misunderstanding, and completely lacks credibility,"" Ohman said. There have also been no widespread changes to the plankton levels in the Atlantic Ocean, said David Johns, head of the Continuous Plankton Record Survey, which was established in 1931 to measure and monitor the ecological health of marine plankton. ""We have analyzed over a quarter-million samples from over 70 years of sampling, and have categorically not seen the declines reported by Dryden, and do not agree with his results,"" Johns said. Ohman said there has been no drop in overall zooplankton populations in the northeast Pacific Ocean, and a rise in phytoplankton. The Continuous Plankton Record Survey works with a large network of scientists around the world. None of the scientists has reported seeing the same declines mentioned in the Goes Foundation survey. There have been some plankton population declines that can be attributed to climate change, but not water pollution as mentioned in the survey, Johns said. ""A reduction as mentioned in Dryden’s report would not only be catastrophic, but also immediately obvious,"" Johns said. ""No plankton, no food for higher trophic levels such as fish, whales, filter-feeding shark and seabirds."" An Instagram post claimed 90% of plankton in the Atlantic Ocean had vanished. The post based its information on a study by the Global Oceanic Environmental Survey Foundation that claimed water samples it took in a part of the Atlantic Ocean showed the dramatic reduction. The organization said its findings could not be applied to the entire ocean, only the specific area from which the samples were taken. However, marine biologists and oceanographers have several issues with the organization’s sampling method and findings and say they have not seen a dramatic drop in the plankton population. In some cases, these experts say, plankton have been increasing. If such a dramatic drop in plankton occurred, it would have a disastrous impact on marine life that would have already been observable",False,"July 27, 2022"
Jane Goodall’s comments about population growth at World Economic Forum show COVID-19 pandemic was planned.,"Did conservationist and primatologist Jane Goodall, a longtime advocate for chimpanzees and the planet, plant the seed that convinced world leaders to unleash the COVID-19 pandemic? That’s what one social media user alleged in a video posted on Instagram, two years after Goodall, a United Nations peace messenger, discussed unchecked population growth’s effects on the environment at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January 2020. Goodall said many of today’s environmental problems wouldn’t exist if the globe had the population it had 500 years ago.  ""They’re not even hiding it any more,"" reads a caption on a July 24 Instagram post. ""Just wait til you find out how many world leaders are a part of the wef…"" ""Wef"" is short for World Economic Forum. The poster expands on his claim in the video, in which he plays a clip of Goodall’s remarks, then cuts in to ask: ""What was the population in the year 1500? About 500 million. What on earth could take place that would cause a planet with 9 billion people on it to be reduced by 95% to 500 million? Hmmm…I wonder if a virus could do that?"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Goodall did make the human population growth comments seen in the video, but she has been making the same arguments for years. And there’s no evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic was intentionally started by world leaders, especially not because of her January 2020 comments, in an effort to lower the population. COVID-19 was already circulating in China a month earlier. Goodall was speaking about human population growth as it relates to sustainability and protecting the Brazilian rainforest, and thus, the environment, in a panel discussion at the forum. Her point, essentially, was that there are more people than the world has resources for, particularly in developing nations. She also said education and family planning are important to check population growth and protect the environment. Speaking at a panel discussion called ""Securing a Sustainable Future for the Amazon,"" Goodall discussed her Trillion Trees Project, part of her effort to protect and restore forests to help the climate. She mentioned four things activists and governments need to focus on to help: poverty, eating less meat, political corruption and human population growth. You can see the full context of her statements in the video above, but she finished with: ""Finally, we cannot hide away from human population growth, because, you know, it underlies so many of the other problems. All these things we talk about wouldn’t be a problem if there was the size of population that there was 500 years ago."" Earlier in the discussion, Goodall spoke of visiting Tanzania and helping to start a scholarship program to keep girls in school after puberty. ""It’s been shown all around the world as women’s education improves, family size drops, and it was the growing human population that was the worst problem destroying the forests in this area,"" said Goodall, who also described starting workshops on family planning. At no point did Goodall advocate for lowering the population.  Goodall has spoken about unchecked population growth and its effect on the environment as far back as 2003 and again in 2007. She made the same points in a video address to a Population Matters conference in 2019. ""I would encourage every single conservation organization, every single government organization to consider the absurdity of unlimited economic development on a planet of finite natural resources,"" she said then. ""Already in some areas, we are using up these precious natural resources faster than Mother Nature can restore them. We can’t go on like this. We can’t push human population growth under the carpet. We must find ways to address it."" COVID-19’s origin is not yet certain, but there’s no evidence that the virus, which has killed nearly 6.4 million people worldwide, including more than 1 million in the United States, was intentionally released to lower the world’s population.  PolitiFact has debunked the notion that the pandemic was somehow planned many times since it began. You can find all our coronavirus-related fact checks here. Although a possible lab leak wasn’t ruled out in a preliminary report in June by a team of scientists investigating the pandemic’s origins for the World Health Organization, two studies published this week in the journal Science say the virus likely jumped from animals to humans in a live market in Wuhan, China. The pandemic has affected population growth, according to the 2022 United Nations World Populations Prospects Report released in July.  ""The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all components of population change, including fertility, mortality and migration,"" said the report, which notes that the average life expectancy fell from 72.8 years in 2019 to 71 years in 2021, mostly because of COVID-19. Despite deaths from the virus, the world’s population is still growing — it’s expected to hit 8 billion people by November and peak at 10.4 billion in the 2080s — although the growth rate is the lowest it’s been since the 1950s, the report said.  It’s clear the pandemic had nothing to do with Goodall’s comments at the 2020 World Economic Forum, as the virus was circulating in China in December 2019, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An Instagram post alleges that the COVID-19 pandemic was planned because Goodall spoke about unchecked human population growth’s effect on the environment at a World Economic Forum meeting in January 2020. But the virus had been circulating in China a month before Goodall made her remarks, and she has made similar comments over at least the past two decades. Despite the pandemic’s toll, the world’s population is growing and is projected to continue to do so. There’s no evidence the pandemic was planned",False Pants on Fire,"July 27, 2022"
Germany weather maps show media exaggerating effects of climate change.,"The overwhelming consensus among scientists is that climate change is real and that it’s most likely caused by humans.  But many social media users are trying to convince others that the media is exaggerating climate change’s effects, with weather forecasts now showing normal summer temperatures in scary red colors to deceive viewers. A July 22 Facebook post showing two maps reads ""Proof that climate change is real. See how the map is getting more red???"" The maps appear as screenshots from two weather forecasts from Germany. The top image is from 2017 and shows temperatures on a green background. The bottom image is from 2022. It shows slightly lower temperatures on a map that is red, orange and yellow. The post, which we found being shared in other social media posts, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post is misleading, said Sabine Renken, a spokesperson for ​​Hessischer Rundfunk, a German public broadcasting corporation that leads the ARD Weather Competence Center. The center produces weather forecasts used in shows across ARD, an association of the nation’s regional public broadcasters. The images, although from the same TV program, were designed to show two different things. The 2017 image with its green coloring shows expected high temperatures for the next day. It’s a screen grab from a June 21, 2017, weather report on a daily news magazine broadcast called ""Tagesthemen,"" which translates to ""Daily Topics."" The green map was not designed to reveal anything about the temperatures, Renken told us. In the full video of that weather report, forecaster Claudia Kleinert points to additional graphics that show showers and thunderstorms, wind direction and the forecast for the next few days, with temperatures cooling, over the same green background. The 2022 image with the red background similarly shows the next day's highs —  this time on a color-coded heat map that was designed specifically to show a change in temperatures across the day. It appeared in a June 20, 2022, weather report from ""Tagesthemen."" Video shows that just before she showed the red map, she pointed to cooler early morning temperatures in green. The red, orange and yellow heat map was part of a change in graphic format implemented in 2020, according to a spokesperson for the broadcaster that produced the weather segment. ""Until 2020, there were no uniform weather forecasts in the ARD,"" Renken said. She said the weather reports were supplied by different editorial offices and companies and looked different in different broadcasts. Hessischer Rundfunk took over production of the weather forecasts in January 2020, Renken said, and the design and presentation were adapted for the broadcasts then. Renken disputed the notion that the two different maps show a conspiracy by weather forecasters to push a climate change agenda.  ""The two graphics differ in design and presentation. Until the end of 2019, the temperature maps supplied in the ""Tagesthemen"" only represented the temperature in numbers — the green background had no relation to the temperature,"" Renken said. In fact, in 2017, a weather report on a separate public broadcasting news program called ""Tagesschau,"" a daily newscast that appears on the same channel and uses the same set as ""Tagesthemen,"" showed the same style of map as those shared in this post, with a green background to show lower temperatures early in the morning, and then transitioned to red to show the weather warming during the day. Many weather forecasts traditionally use colors to differentiate between cold, moderate and hot temperatures.  A look at the national forecast on July 25 from The Weather Channel, which is based in the U.S., shows the color red being used to show warm temperatures, with pink used for extreme heat and yellow and orange for milder temperatures.  Weather Central uses a similar color scheme, as does the National Weather Service, though red there is reserved for temperatures exceeding 100 degrees. WGN-TV, a Chicago station, uses a similar method to differentiate temperatures. Renken pointed us to a 2019 article from an ARD fact-checker that debunked a similar claim about maps from 2009 and 2019 that alleged that ""Tagesschau"" was manipulating them to exaggerate the effects of climate change. A Facebook post claims that green and red colors showing temperatures in two different weather maps five years apart in Germany show the media is manipulating the maps to push a climate change agenda by adding red to make it seem hotter. But the maps in the post show two different things — one, from 2017, shows a general weather forecast on a green background; one, from 2022, shows only temperatures on a red background. The earlier green background had nothing to do with the temperatures, while the red background in 2022 did",False,"July 27, 2022"
"""The emissions generated by watching 30 minutes of Netflix is the same as driving almost 4 miles.”","Don’t touch that dial — or rather, don’t exit that tab of Netflix — if you’re worried that streaming services are as bad for the environment as a short drive. A popular screenshot of a tweet claims, ""Your Netflix binge-watching is making climate change worse, say experts. The emissions generated by watching 30 minutes of Netflix is the same as driving almost 4 miles.""  The tweet from @BigThink crossed over to Facebook, where it was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We wondered whether the comparison between driving a specific distance and watching Netflix for a specific amount of time checks out.  Broadly speaking, watching streaming services does impact climate change through energy use, data transfer, and the production of devices such as TVs and computers. But the comparison presented doesn’t add up. We found the claim on Facebook, Twitter and meme pages. Often, a screenshot of the original tweet is shown with a response from the Twitter account @lexcanroar.  The @bigthink tweet was originally meant to promote this article on bigthink.com, but the tweet has been deleted. The article now includes a correction dated Jan. 24, 2020. The correction says the article originally ""relied on data produced by the The Shift Project,"" which is a French think tank advocating a shift to a post-carbon economy. The article, which is about the carbon impact of streaming services, no longer contains any comparison between driving and Netflix. According to its website, the specific claim about the half-hour of viewing came from an oral interview, quotes from which were published in AFP, a French cooperative news agency. The original statement on AFP was: ""Watching a half-hour show would lead to emissions of 1.6 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent, said Maxime Efoui-Hess of French think tank the Shift Project. That's equivalent to driving 3.9 miles (6.28 kilometers)."" The claim warped to include Netflix as it gained media traction. In response, the International Energy Agency published a fact-check in February 2020 by digital/energy analyst George Kamiya. Finding the exact comparison between driving and Netflix is difficult, as all kinds of data fluctuate. As Kamiya wrote, watching on different devices and driving different cars affects the comparison. Even the year makes a difference, because energy efficiency for data transfer is growing rapidly, as is the efficiency of cars and the availability of electric cars. Driving at different speeds or using energy from different countries can influence these numbers, too. That said, Kamiya came up with an estimate based on averages in 2019. He wrote that streaming a 30-minute show on Netflix in 2019 released around 18 grams of emissions.  According to a report published by the Environmental Protection Agency in March 2018, the average American passenger car emits 404 grams of carbon dioxide per mile. That means 4 miles of driving emits about 1,616 grams of CO2, which is about 90 times Kamiya’s estimate of the emissions of a 30-minute Netflix show. If you do a little more math, you’ll find that the estimated emissions of a 4-mile drive is around the same as 45 hours of video streaming in the U.S.  Kamiya described streaming as ""a fairly low-emitting activity."" The Shift Project responded to Kamiya’s fact-check with this document in June 2020, stating that Kamiya was correct about the Netflix claim being wrong, and that some of the data in one of its earlier reports had been flawed. (Kamiya also challenged the results of the Shift Project’s newer report in a November 2020 update to his IEA article.)  The claim in the Facebook post said, ""The emissions generated by watching 30 minutes of Netflix is the same as driving almost 4 miles.""  The claim is attributed to The Shift Project, which describes it as an ""error"" that ""appeared during an interview."" Carbon emissions are complicated to gauge across different people who use different devices, drive different cars, get energy from different sources, and so on. However, an estimate from the International Energy Agency estimated that when this claim was made in 2019, 4 miles of driving  had more similar carbon emissions to streaming 45 hours of Netflix",False,"July 26, 2022"
"""If every person on earth just recycled, stopped using plastic straws, and drove an electric car, 100 corporations would still produce 70% of total global emissions.""","If you're on the climate doom side of the internet, you may have seen claims that blame 100 corporations for producing 70% of all the harmful emissions that are driving climate change, otherwise known as greenhouse gas emissions. ""If every person on earth just recycled, stopped using plastic straws, and drove an electric car, 100 corporations would still produce 70% of total global emissions,"" says a 2021 tweet from self-described socialist @GoodPoliticGuy that was shared on several other accounts.  These social media users aren't the first — and they probably won't be the last — to place the majority of the climate change burden on 100 companies. The claim originates from a widely shared 2017 report from Climate Accountability Institute, a nonprofit advocacy group and the nonprofit charity Carbon Disclosure Project. Headlines from The Guardian, CNBC, Fortune and more claiming 100 companies are responsible for 71% of all emissions quickly followed. But the report found that 71% of global industrial greenhouse gases can be attributed to 100 companies from 1988 to 2015. Keyword: industrial, which represents a part of total global emissions, but not all of them. Total global emissions account for the greenhouse gases that are released from food production, burning gasoline, deforestation, oil production and more. The study focused on just the carbon dioxide and methane emissions from fossil fuel and cement production, which still make up a majority of global atmospheric greenhouse gases. It's wrong to suggest that consumers don't factor in global warming. Research shows the human activities driving climate change the most are from heating buildings, electricity use, agriculture, farming and fossil fuel-burning facilities and vehicles. The original study did not include emissions from land use, land use change or forestry, or from sources such as landfills, agriculture and farming. It also did not include data on indirect emissions, which come from purchased energy such as heating and electricity, citing concerns about double-counting emissions attributable to corporations. The study relied on data collected by the Carbon Majors Database, which focuses on greenhouse gas emissions data from the largest company-related sources. In other words, The data derives from records of carbon dioxide and methane emissions relating to fossil fuel (oil, gas and coal) and cement producers dating back to 1854. Richard Heede, the Climate Accountability Institute's director and the study’s co-author, leads the Carbon Majors Database. It contains operational and product-related carbon dioxide and methane emissions related to 100 fossil fuel producers, aka the ""carbon majors,"" which include ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, Chevron, Peabody and BHP Billiton. It’s difficult to discern how much total global emissions can be attributed to the top 100 polluting corporations, but there are ways to get a ballpark idea.  If you use the total global emissions calculated by the Climate Analysis Indicators Tool, an average of around 60% of global emissions can be traced back to those 100 companies from 1990 to 2015. But CAIT's research includes emissions from agriculture, land use and electricity that wasn't considered in the 2017 study. If you use the total global emissions excluding land use and land-use change and forestry emissions from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, then an average of around 63% of those emissions can be traced back to those 100 companies from 1988 to 2015. But Potsdam's research includes nitrous oxide and F-gases — fluorinated gases used in industrial applications — and considered only fossil fuel-related carbon dioxide and methane emissions. Heede said in an email to PolitiFact that his recent research — not yet published — indicates that the emissions the study considered (carbon dioxide and methane from fossil fuels and cement production) account for 70.4% of total human-made emissions from 1988-2018. That could mean that about half of total global emissions can be traced back to those 100 companies. But the timelines are not equal, and it's not peer-reviewed. There are many ways to categorize where greenhouse gas emissions come from, such as by country, by economic sector or, in Heede's research, by corporation. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is the United Nations body responsible for human-induced climate change data and the internationally trusted source for global emissions statistics. The panel divides total human-made greenhouse gas emissions into different economic sectors, including ""industry."" That's not to be confused with Heede's definition of ""industrial greenhouse gases,"" which includes all fossil fuel use and cement process emissions. Additionally, the 71% figure from the study that focused on 1988 to 2015 has become outdated. Heede said recent research from the Global Carbon Project now attributes 69.5% of global fossil fuel and cement emissions from 1751 to 2018 to the top 100 fossil-fuel producers. So, 100 corporations are not responsible for 71% of total global emissions. The study found that 71% of global fossil fuel and cement emissions can be attributed to 100 companies, and Heede was intentional with careful wording.  Heede also said direct emissions that come from company operations, such as extracting and refining oil, typically account for around 12% of a ""carbon major"" company's total emissions. The other 88% comes from the consumption of the products. For example, Chevron, the top emitter of U.S.-tied fossil fuel companies, directly emits harmful greenhouse gases when it explores new areas to drill oil or when it refines that oil into gasoline. But of the approximate 48,267 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent Chevron emitted from 1965 to 2018, around 42,474 of it (or 88%) is estimated to come from the cars burning gasoline, the airplanes burning fuel, etc. ""I hold the companies accountable for producing and marketing harmful products and for deceptively perpetuating the carbon age for fun and profit,"" Heede said. Climate activists have used the study to push for tighter emissions regulations and counter the argument of increased individual responsibility, like cutting out plastic straws or driving electric vehicles. Heede is doubtful either of the climate activists' calls will be answered. Without regulations forcing corporations to produce less, there is little reason to believe consumers will reduce their consumption enough to dramatically slow climate change. ""It is unlikely that human behavior will change enough to avert serious climate damages,"" Heede said. ""We love our stuff, we love to eat high on the food chain, we keep getting into wars over resources, we like the way we live: big houses, big cars, lots of material goods. Yet only a fraction of U.S. emissions are within our immediate control."" Retrofitting houses to be more energy- and carbon-efficient, driving an electric car and composting waste can help, Heede said, ""but industry and commerce and landfills and transportation will still have a large carbon footprint."" An Instagram post claimed, ""If every person on earth just recycled, stopped using plastic straws, and drove an electric car, 100 corporations would still produce 70% of total global emissions."" No, 100 corporations do not produce 70% of total global emissions. The 2017 study that is often cited found that 100 corporations could be attributed to 71% of fossil fuel and cement emissions. The difference between the two claims is in the denominator of the corporation emission equation: it's not all emissions, just industrial greenhouse gas emissions from 1988 to 2015. Research that accurately compares the total global emissions to the data collected from the 100 most-polluting corporations worldwide does not exist yet. The study tied emissions from consuming ""carbon major"" products to the companies that produced those products. So, in theory, everyone driving an electric car would create less demand for gasoline and decrease companies' emissions",False,"July 22, 2022"
Images of Plymouth Rock prove sea levels are not rising.,"Legend has it that, upon arriving in North America, the Pilgrims stepped off the Mayflower onto the large boulder that now sits in a place of prominence on the Plymouth, Massachusetts, waterfront.  Plymouth Rock is a well-known tourist attraction, but its connection to early U.S. history is unproven. And despite what some social media users have claimed, the landmark cannot be used to disprove that sea levels are rising. An Instagram user shared a July 17 meme about the rock that read, ""Plymouth Rock, 2022 still at sea level.""  On July 12, a Facebook user shared another meme featuring two pictures of Plymouth Rock side by side, one labeled ""1620 at sea level"" and the other ""2022 still at sea level.""  (Screengrab from Facebook.) The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) These Plymouth Rock memes do not prove that sea levels remain unchanged; the posts are false and misleading. There is no evidence the rock proudly displayed under the portico in Plymouth today is the exact place where Pilgrims first disembarked the Mayflower in Plymouth, much less that it was found at sea level. (The Pilgrims first landed in Provincetown, Massachusetts, on Nov. 11, 1620. The Mayflower anchored in Plymouth Harbor a few weeks later.) There are two primary accounts of the Pilgrims’ Plymouth landing, but ""both simply say that the Pilgrims landed. Neither mentions any rocks in their account of the landing,"" said Plymouth’s Pilgrim Hall Museum’s website. ""The first references to Plymouth Rock are found over 100 years after the actual landing."" The National Museum of American History site refers to the story of the Pilgrims landing at Plymouth Rock as ""oral tradition,"" and said no contemporary accounts of the landing mention a rock. Plymouth’s tourism website said in 1741 an elder identified Plymouth Rock as the exact landing spot. Although the veracity of the elder’s claim is unknown, Plymouth Rock ""quickly became an American icon,"" the site added.  Visitors stand in a pavilion while looking at Plymouth Rock, in Plymouth, Massachusetts, on Nov. 18, 2018. (AP) Once the boulder was identified as Plymouth Rock, its nomadic history began. ""In 1774, a team attempted to move the rock from shore and place it next to Plymouth’s liberty pole in the town square,"" said the National Museum of American History. ""Before it could be removed from the beach, it accidentally broke in two.""  One part of the rock remained in place; the other piece was moved to the town square.  More than 100 years later in 1880, ""the two pieces were reunited back on the shore and cemented together,"" the National Museum of American History said. In most images of the rock, it is easy to see where it was fused back together. Pilgrim Hall Museum’s website said ""1620"" was also cut into Plymouth Rock in 1880.  In 1920, the rock was moved again, when Plymouth’s waterfront was redesigned and the shoreline was rebuilt, according to Pilgrim Hall Museum’s site. The rock has also been underwater before, during extreme weather and exceptionally high tides called king tides.

Pilgrims would have got their feet wet landing on #PlymouthRock today. @ericfisher @Plymouth_400 pic.twitter.com/DxgQQXxu3J Furthermore, experts said the rock is not a useful landmark for measuring sea level changes. Michael Oppenheimer, a Princeton University professor of geosciences and international affairs, said a single, stationary object ""anchored in bedrock and free of tectonic activity"" can sometimes be used to measure local sea levels.  ""But all it can indicate is local sea level, not ‘sea levels’ generally or the global mean rise,"" Oppenheimer said. Local sea level rise can significantly differ from the global mean sea level rise because of land sinking or tectonic activity, he said.  Gary Griggs, a University of California, Santa Cruz, professor of earth sciences, said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been tracking sea levels relative to land in Boston, near Plymouth Rock, for 100 years. These records show that sea levels have risen about 11.4 inches in the past century.  Satellite data, which has been used to measure sea level rise since 1993, indicates an average rate of global sea level rise of about 13.9 inches per century, Griggs said. That rate is accelerating; over the past decade, the rate has increased to about 19.7 inches per 100 years, he said. ""This is relatively simple science, and there are no alternate interpretations or facts,"" Griggs said. ""Sea-level rise is directly connected to a warming climate. The warmer the planet gets, the more sea water expands, and the more ice melts, all adding to sea level."" Oppenheimer also said global mean sea levels are rising annually and that the rise is accelerating. ""There is no doubt about this,"" he said. Rising sea levels cause problems, some of which have already begun, Oppenheimer said.  ""So-called nuisance or fair-weather flooding has increased in frequency, meaning that high tides now flood streets on a regular basis along the coast in many states — up to 10 times as frequently as 50 years ago,"" he said. ""Furthermore, in large coastal storms, flood risk is increasing as water penetrates inland further and to higher elevation."" There’s no proof that Plymouth Rock was at sea level when it might have welcomed the Pilgrims in 1620. The rock has also moved several times in the past 400 years and is sometimes submerged during high tides and extreme weather. Experts said that Plymouth Rock is not useful for evaluating sea level changes. That sea levels are rising, however, is undisputed",False,"July 20, 2022"

Much of the U.S. is experiencing drought.

Including Hawaii and Alaska, 44.98% of the U.S. was in drought.  A coyote walks across dry land that was once under the water of Lake Mead near Hemenway Harbor at the Lake Mead National Recreation Area on, July 4, 2022, in Boulder City, Nev. (AP) The weekly updated U.S. Drought Monitor map shows the location and intensity of drought across the U.S. using a five-category classification: abnormally dry (predrought conditions), moderate, severe, extreme and exceptional drought.  About 218 million acres of U.S. crops, largely corn and soybeans that rely on rain rather than irrigation, were experiencing drought, and 40 states were experiencing moderate drought or worse, the week of July 6 to July 12, according to national data.  The Drought Monitor map is created by scientists from the NOAA, the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln and the U.S. Department of Agriculture who evaluate regional drought conditions, consult with experts and publish the map. ""Each week, drought experts consider how recent precipitation totals across the country compare to their long-term averages,"" the National Integrated Drought Information System’s website said. ""They check variables including temperatures, soil moisture, water levels in streams and lakes, snow cover and meltwater runoff. Experts also check whether areas are showing drought impacts such as water shortages and business interruptions.""  There’s no evidence that these organizations are lying about droughts in the U.S, as the post suggests. But we found numerous news reports in which farmers and others reported drought-related setbacks and changes. One California farmer told CNN he didn’t have enough water to plant crops on all his land, so he stopped growing asparagus and sweet corn. BBC reported that another farmer in California said he didn’t have enough water to plant his usual tomato crop. In Arizona, a farmer told CNBC he’d stopped growing cotton, which requires more water, to focus on corn, wheat and alfalfa.  In 2021, the severe drought in the West drained reservoirs, reducing hydropower plants’ output. Power production was down 25% at the Hoover Dam in Nevada, one of the largest hydropower generators in the U.S., The Associated Press reported. Compared with a 10-year average, California hydropower plants generated 48% less electricity in 2021 — and the outlook in 2022 is worse, per MIT Technology Review.  Houseboats sit in the drought lowered waters of Oroville Lake, near Oroville, Calif., on April 19, 2022. (AP) Australia’s ABC News reported that the Great Salt Lake in Utah has lost nearly half its surface area from the historic average and now contains just one-fourth of the water it held at its high point in 1987.

Studies show plastics can help combat climate change.,"Plastics can help fight climate change? The perplexing statement was recently made on Facebook by America’s Plastic Makers, a U.S. plastics producer that says its mission is to end plastic waste with modern materials. ""Studies show #plastic can help combat climate change,"" the post says. ""Researchers found using plastic in packaging and consumer products can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to many alternative materials.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) America’s Plastic Makers is run by the American Chemistry Council, an industry trade association for U.S. chemical companies, and is one of the leading producers of plastic in the U.S. The group’s post links to a page on its website that says decades of analysis shows plastics are strong and lightweight, thus requiring less material than steel, paper, aluminum and glass. The group says that replacing plastics with these materials, in many cases, would ""significantly increase greenhouse gas emissions."" But this oversimplifies a complex issue about plastic packaging's benefits versus its negative impacts on the marine environment and human health. Many studies have found that plastic significantly contributes to climate change because of the high carbon dioxide emissions that occur at every stage of its life.  Plastics are made from raw materials like natural gas, oil or plants, which are refined into ethane and propane before being treated with heat, turning them into ethylene and propylene.  These materials combine to create different polymers, which look like powdered laundry detergent. That’s melted down, cooled and eventually molded to make products like water bottles, food packaging, auto parts, medical devices and more. This process — which includes the extraction and transportation of oil and gas, as well as the steps to refine the plastic — emits millions of metric tons of carbon dioxide every year. In its report, America’s Plastic Makers uses various life-cycle studies — a methodology for assessing environmental impacts associated with the different stages of a product, process or service — from 2011, 2016 and 2018. Those studies suggest that plastic can perform the functions of paper or glass, but with less material and less weight, leading to less production energy and greenhouse gases. The benefits of lightweight material are legitimate, but plastics still have negatives. Primarily, American consumers use so much plastic that it still has a large negative impact on the environment.  A May 2019 report called ""Plastic & Climate: The Hidden Costs of a Plastic Planet,"" by the Center for International Environmental Law, found that the manufacture of plastics is particularly greenhouse-gas intensive. In 2015, emissions from manufacturing ethylene were 184.3 to 213 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, about as much as what 45 million vehicles emit during one year. Then there’s the repeated disposal of plastic packaging, via landfill, incineration or recycling. Incineration has the largest climate impact. U.S. emissions from plastics incineration in 2015 were 5.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.  Because plastics are so common and so easily disposed of, it’s not especially realistic to compare their environmental impact to other materials.  ""This topic is indeed more complicated than the (American Plastic Makers) report suggests,"" said Rob Jackson, an earth systems professor at Stanford University. ""I’m reminded of the common question, ‘Paper or plastic?’ The right answer is whatever you already have, so long as you reuse it."" Finally, researchers have found that plastics have a large negative impact on the earth’s oceans. The ocean acts like a huge sink for global pollution, with tons of plastic dumped in waters around the world every year. Hundreds of thousands of marine animals get entangled in plastic waste each year and ingest and suffocate on plastic products they mistake for food. Studies evaluating how plastics impact marine environment and human health acknowledge that the material is cheap, strong and durable, and offers benefits to humanity, but say that waste management practices and human behavior have created a real problem. Plastics do not biodegrade but they do eventually break down under sunlight and fragment into small particles, called microplastics. One 2012 report published in Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology said that 267 species in the marine environment are known to have been harmed by plastic entanglement or ingestion. Scientists suspect that ocean pollution is an important but insufficiently understood component of global pollution that poses serious threats to human health and well-being. Matthew Kastner, director of media relations for the Chemistry Council’s plastics division, acknowledged the danger of ocean pollution but also said the press has made exaggerated claims about plastics and greenhouse gas emissions. ""This is a short social media post intended to help correct the record,"" Kastner told PolitiFact. ""We 100% agree that plastics do not belong in the ocean or anywhere in the environment."" All this presents a complicated choice in terms of deciding what to choose for packaging, researchers say. ""What is clear is that we need to reduce plastics production while ensuring that any alternatives do not contribute more to climate change, and this is where recycling comes in,"" a 2020 analysis by the Imperial College of London says. ""The emissions reductions from eliminating the need for new plastic outweigh the slightly higher emissions that come from processing wastes to recover plastics."" America’s Plastic Makers claimed on Facebook that plastic can help combat climate change. It’s true that some studies have found that plastic packaging is less environmentally damaging than alternatives like glass and paper, but this doesn’t negate plastics' negative impact on human health and marine environment.  Instead of assessing which packaging to use, researchers said the focus should be on ramping up recycling and reuse practices. The topic is more complicated than the post suggests",Half True,"May 26, 2022"
“CO2 is not a pollutant.”,"The Republican Party of Virginia recently held a weekend bash at a Dulles hotel to celebrate its sweep in the statewide elections last fall and discuss its agenda. High among its goals is to repeal the state’s Clean Economy Act, a law that commits Virginia to joining a regional cap-and-trade program and achieving 100% carbon-free power by 2050. The law was passed in 2020 when Democrats controlled both chambers of the General Assembly as well as the governorship. The law was labeled ""wokeism"" at a seminar held by the Suburban Virginia Republican Coalition, an Alexandria-based group that says its weekly newsletter reaches 25,000 people. SUVGOP rejects that a climate crisis exists and that man-made carbon dioxide (CO2) is harming the environment. ""CO2 is not a pollutant,"" SUVGOP said in its presentation materials for the April 30 session. The statement contradicts piles of scientific studies showing increasing CO2 levels are contributing to rising temperatures across the globe, the efforts of industrial nations to reduce their emissions, a ruling by the Supreme Court and a statement by the Environmental Protection Agency. Let’s start with a trip back to middle school science, where we learned about  photosynthesis. Plants pull in carbon dioxide through tiny openings in their leaves where it combines with water and sunlight to create sugar, producing oxygen as a byproduct.  It may be hard to imagine something as life-sustaining as CO2 could be so damaging, but it’s what’s called a greenhouse gas. Those gasses, which also include methane, nitrous oxide and others,  produce an insulating effect that allows sun rays to enter the atmosphere but not leave after they bounce off the earth’s surface. When fossil fuels - such as oil, gas and petroleum - are burned to create energy, they release CO2. In the U.S., 76% of greenhouse gas emissions are CO2. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased by 47% since the beginning of the Industrial Age and 11% since 2000, according to NASA.  The Supreme Court, by a 5-4 vote, ruled in 2007 that greenhouse gasses fall under the Clean Air Act’s definition of pollutants and can be regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency. (The high court heard oral arguments in February 2022 challenging the ruling but has yet to render a second opinion.)   In 2009, the EPA classified greenhouse gasses - especially from vehicle emissions - as a form of pollution. The gasses ""are the primary driver of climate change, which can lead to hotter, longer heat waves that threaten the health of the sick, poor or elderly; increases in ground-level ozone pollution linked to asthma and other respiratory illnesses; as well as other threats to the health and welfare of Americans,"" the EPA said. Why does SUVGOP reject these findings? We asked Collister Johnson, a senior advisor to the group who led the presentation as well as another one to the state’s Republican party in December 2021. ""I’ve been studying this for a long time,"" said Johnson, who lives in Alexandria and is a former chairman of the Virginia Port Authority and administrator of the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation. ""We breathe in carbon dioxide. The notion that it’s polluting to human beings doesn’t hold up."" Johnson laid out his arguments in a 2020 article for CFACT, a conservative organization that disputes human-made climate change. He accurately noted that CO2 constitutes about four of every 10,000 molecules in the atmosphere - an increase of about one CO2 molecule since the mid-20th century.  ""Most importantly, the theory of man-made global warming does not pass the sniff test – the test of common sense,"" Johnson wrote. ""It simply does not follow common sense to believe that an increase of one human-caused atmospheric CO2 molecule out of ten thousand over eighty years should result in the ruination of the planet. Johnson’s logic, a talking point among climate-change doubters, is widely dismissed by climate scientists. They say the important point is that CO2 levels are increasing - not that they still compose a tiny part of the atmosphere.  ""It shouldn't be surprising that a small amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can have a big effect,"" wrote Jason West, a professor of environmental sciences and engineering at the University of North Carolina. ""We take pills that are a tiny fraction of our body mass and expect them to affect us."" Vickie Connors, an assistant professor at Virginia Commonwealth University’s Center for Environmental Studies, wrote in an email, ""The argument that common sense has any role to play in determining the ultimate outcome from our unabated release of fossil fuel emissions into our thin envelope of atmosphere is outrageous in this era of global data sets, measurements of temperature increases from any altitude above the surface to the tropopause, in the surface and upper layers of the oceans, in the upper soil horizon, in the measured melting [of] sea ice, glaciers, and snow at high elevation and polar latitudes."" Johnson has also noted that CO2 levels were once 10 times higher than they are today and ""animal life thrived and prospered."" But scientists told us that occurred before humans existed. ""‘Pollution’ is a term that is somewhat human-centric,"" John Reilly, co-director of the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, wrote in an email. Kevin Trenberth, distinguished scholar at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, sent us an email labeling the CO2 claims by Johnson and SUVGOP ""misleading rubbish."" SUVGOP, in a presentation at a meeting of the state Republican Party, said ""CO2 is not a pollutant."" The statement contradicts piles of scientific studies showing increasing CO2 levels are contributing to rising temperatures across the globe, the conclusions of almost all climate scientists, a ruling by the Supreme Court and a statement by the Environmental Protection Agency",False,"May 12, 2022"
"In cutting greenhouse gas emissions, the United States is “the leader in the world by far.”","The latest United Nations climate change report had a grim forecast: If greenhouse gas emissions don’t peak within three years, then there’s little hope of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Alaska Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan says one of the best moves the United States could make is to speed up the shift in places like China and India from coal to natural gas. Sullivan has a plan to increase American natural gas production, liquify it and ship it overseas. His key supporting argument is the hefty 14% drop in American carbon dioxide emissions over the last 15 years. ""If every other country in the world had a record like this, where do you think we would be on global emissions?"" Sullivan said at a March 23 Senate hearing. ""We are the leader in the world by far."" Whether the U.S. is the world leader in cutting emissions depends on how you measure things. In total metric tons, Sullivan is right. But in relative terms, many economic peers achieved steeper declines.  At the Senate hearing, Sullivan displayed a chart showing the change in carbon dioxide emissions in nine countries between 2005 and 2020. The U.S. stands out with a fall between those years of 970 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. Japan’s emissions went down 237 million metric tons. China, on the other hand, released an additional 4,689 million metric tons in 2020 than it did in 2005, while India’s emissions rose 1,315 million metric tons. Chart used by Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, to show carbon dioxide emission trends for nine countries. (Office of Dan Sullivan) Sullivan’s staff pulled these numbers from the website Our World in Data, a reliable resource based at the University of Oxford in England. The numbers are accurate, although climate trackers warn against including 2020 numbers, because the COVID-19 economic shutdown distorted normal emission patterns. In our analysis, we looked at 2005 to 2019. The first caveat to Sullivan’s approach is that he uses absolute numbers. Rob Jackson, an earth systems professor at Stanford University, said the chart is ""conveniently misleading."" The United States has the largest reduction because, in 2005, Jackson said, it had the highest emissions. ""Other countries, in Europe in particular, have done far more than we have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,"" Jackson said. Looking at the percentage change in carbon dioxide emissions, the United Kingdom made the greatest progress, with a reduction of 35%. Italy, France and Germany came next. The United States and Japan tied for fifth place with reductions of about 14%.   Sullivan spokesman Ben Dietderich agreed that the relative changes reshuffled the rankings, but he countered that the absolute number of tons mattered most. It’s the tons of carbon dioxide that affect the global climate, he said. At the end of the day, Dietderich said, the United States made the largest contribution to reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Jackson raised another issue with Sullivan’s chart — it left out emissions per person. China’s emissions are enormous, but the country also has 1.4 billion people. Viewed through that lens, despite the decline in U.S. emissions, the United States remained the larger emitter per capita. ""Our per capita emissions are still twice China’s and eight times higher than India’s,"" Jackson said.   Sullivan’s focus on carbon dioxide doesn’t give the full picture of American emissions. There are other greenhouse gases, most importantly methane and nitrous oxide. The same website that provided the carbon dioxide numbers also has data for greenhouse gases across the board. Factoring in all greenhouse gases, the U.S. trends are less dramatic. The total decline goes from a reduction of 879 million metric tons to 607 million metric tons. As a percentage, the decline goes from 14.3% for carbon dioxide alone to 9.5% for all greenhouse gases combined. The numbers work that way because it doesn’t take much of those other gases to put a lot of carbon into the air. While natural gas was the single largest factor in cutting U.S. emissions, major contributions also came from the rise in wind power and efficiency gains in American industry that lowered demand. Sullivan’s point was that if other countries followed the United States’ lead, global emissions would fall. Since the blossoming of natural gas production played a large role in the U.S., it makes sense, he said, to expand production further and export to coal-burning countries like China and India. Not so fast, say energy researchers. Michael Young, a senior scientist at the University of Texas at Austin, said building the pipelines and processing plants to send natural gas overseas adds carbon to the atmosphere. It’s possible, Young said, that exports to Asia could reduce emissions there if they replaced coal or wood. ""But it’s also true that liquified natural gas from the U.S. will embed carbon dioxide emissions in the production and transportation of the fuel, reducing the benefits,"" Young said. ""Whether the two balance out depends on many factors."" Ben King, a senior analyst at Rhodium Group, a private research center, said while industry is getting better at preventing the release of methane gas, it still happens in the liquefaction process. More troubling, King said, is that building new plants to export natural gas is a 30-year investment. ""Locking in long-lived fossil fuel assets runs directly counter to the need, recently affirmed in the latest International Panel on Climate Change report, to quickly transition away from uncontrolled fossil fuel use,"" King said. Sullivan said the United States is ""the leader in the world by far"" in cutting greenhouse gas emissions.  In absolute terms, that is accurate – but it isn’t telling the full story. Relative to the scale of emissions in other leading economies, other countries show much deeper reductions. Sullivan also left out emissions per person in the United States. While those have gone down, they are still about twice as high as they are in China",Half True,"April 6, 2022"
"“If you look at windmills” and the greenhouse gas emissions from building to retiring them, “the overall return is negative.”","Eli Bremer is one of seven Colorado Republicans vying to be the party’s nominee to face Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet in the midterm elections. Bremer, a former  pentathlon Olympian, criticized Democrats’ emphasis on renewable energy, saying that it isn’t as green as Democrats make it out to be. ""If you look at windmills, there’s a lot of greenhouse gas emission cost that we gloss over,"" Bremer said in a Fox News interview March 23. ""We extract the raw materials from the ground, process them, assemble them, maintain them for the lifespan of the windmill, then we decommission them. Virtually every expert that I’ve talked to believes that the overall return is negative."" Is it true that in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, the lifetime return on wind turbines is negative? We reached out to Bremer’s campaign to see what experts he relied on, and we didn’t hear back. But what he said runs counter to every major study of this issue.  While Bremer was singling out windmills, the fact is that no matter what the fuel — natural gas, wind, solar, coal, etc. — you have to build whatever it is you’re going to use to generate electricity.  ""Industrial infrastructure requires energy inputs and in that way, windmills or power plants, or for that matter, football stadiums, are the same,"" said Carey King, assistant director at the University of Texas at Austin Energy Institute. The energy used in construction emits greenhouse gases. Once you’ve emitted those greenhouse gases, you can’t undo them. But that doesn’t mean all sources of electricity are equal. The key question, King said, is how does wind compare to other ways of making power? Unlike a plant powered by natural gas or coal, where you have to burn fuel and release more greenhouse gases every day to make electricity, a wind turbine requires a tiny amount of energy once it’s up. The longer it stays in service, the lower its lifetime carbon footprint per kilowatt hour, because the initial greenhouse gas emissions tied to construction (and end-of-life decommissioning) get spread out over more years and electrical output. There are two ways to look at the emissions of windmills, and we’ll consider both. There’s the energy payback time and lifetime carbon footprint. For decades, researchers have been assessing how long a windmill must generate power before it creates more energy than it took to build it. This work folds in all the steps that go into turning wind into electricity. Study after study has found that when all is said and done, a properly placed turbine nets out positive fairly quickly. A 2016 study from Danish engineers looked at onshore and offshore turbines and found that the ""energy payback time"" for all technologies was less than one year. A group of engineers in Texas did similar work and reported in 2016 that ""the payback times for CO2 and energy consumption range from 6 to 14 and 6 to 17 months,"" with on-shore facilities having a shorter payback. The longest payback period we found came from a 2019 study from engineers at the University of Texas at Arlington who factored in the wind speeds from a working wind farm in Texas with 200 turbines. By their calculations, a turbine at that wind farm that lasts 20 years will reach a full energy payback in less than six years. They examined in detail the energy it took to move the turbine components from where they were made in Spain to the Lone Star Wind Farm near Abilene, Texas. They also measured the energy it took to get raw materials to the factories in Spain where manufacturing took place. The wind at the Lone Star Wind Farm varies and the researchers used that data to find the actual average wind speed through the year.  Across all studies that compare the energy that goes into the wind power system to the energy it produces, whether it takes one year or six, a wind turbine lands in positive territory. There’s not an exact mapping of energy inputs to greenhouse gas emissions. But ""a faster energy payback period should translate into a lower carbon emissions per kilowatt hour,"" said King with the Energy Institute. Another way to compare different sources of electricity is to look at how much carbon dioxide, and its equivalents, it takes to produce a certain amount of power — often measured in kilowatt hours. In 2021, natural gas and coal produced about two-thirds of America’s electricity. Wind accounted for about 9%, hydropower for about 6% and solar about 3%.   In 2021, a team at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory reviewed the findings from about 350 studies of the carbon footprints of all major energy sources. The higher the grams of carbon dioxide equivalents per kilowatt hour, the greater the carbon footprint.  Here’s what they found in terms of median grams of CO2 equivalents per kilowatt hour:  Wind: 13  Nuclear: 13 Hydropower: 21 Solar: 43 Natural gas: 486 Coal: 1,001   The high numbers for fossil fuels stem from the ongoing need to burn fuel to make power. A windmill emits about one fourtieth as much greenhouse gases as a natural gas-fired power plant. Bremer said once you factor in the emissions that come from building and putting up a windmill, you end up with a net negative. This is not correct, based on the most comprehensive assessments that compare the carbon footprint of all sources of electricity across their lifetimes. Wind power comes out far ahead of fossil fuels like natural gas and coal, because it doesn’t require the constant release of greenhouse gases to produce electricity.  It takes between one to six years for a wind turbine to produce more power than is used to build, install, maintain and retire it. In terms of carbon footprint, a wind turbine produces about 40 times less greenhouse gases than a natural gas-fired plant",False,"March 28, 2022"
"""Bill Gates hatches 'horribly stupid' plan to block out the sun""","Bill Gates has been falsely accused of many villainous plans, from depopulating the Earth to pushing microchips as part of all medical procedures. Now, a recycled claim says Gates’ aims go even higher — literally. ""Bill Gates hatches 'horribly stupid' plan to block out the sun,"" says the headline on a Feb. 21 article on the Daily Star website. The article was shared on Facebook and was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Gates did not personally hatch a plan, nor is he — or anyone — scheming to block out the sun. The claim first surfaced in 2021 and has been previously debunked by multiple fact checkers. The falsehood centers on a small-scale experiment that Harvard researchers proposed — called SCoPEx, short for Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment — that would spray aerosols into the atmosphere to reflect some sunlight back into space, a technology aimed at minimizing global warming. It’s called solar radiation management, or solar geoengineering. ""Geoengineering is a blanket term for technologies that try to alter Earth’s physical qualities on the largest scale possible,"" Popular Mechanics reported. ""One example is cloud seeding, where airplanes flush clouds with particulate matter in order to coalesce into rain."" Solar geoengineering involves using technology to try to reflect solar radiation back into space before it can interact with greenhouse gases. The most commonly proposed method is to use aerosols — ""the gaseous clouds formed by particles of many common materials"" — because the physical structure of their particles blocks and scatters light, according to Popular Mechanics. The claim that solar geoengineering is an effort to ""block out the sun"" is inaccurate; the technology is a riff on a naturally occurring process. Already, about 30% of the sun’s energy is reflected back into space by clouds and ice, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental nonprofit group. But solar geoengineering is controversial, even according to the Harvard researchers who proposed the experiment. For one thing, the methods could have unintended consequences on global weather patterns. The proposed Harvard experiment would use a high-altitude balloon to lift instruments into the atmosphere and release aerosols. The small-scale experiment is ""to test the risks and efficacy"" of solar radiation management, the researchers said, and to gather information that cannot be obtained through computer modeling and lab work. As Popular Mechanics noted, ""(A)ll of the scientists and backers involved are only suggesting doing research—not taking large-scale action."" Gates’ only connection to the research is through his donation to Harvard’s Solar Geoengineering Research Program, which is providing part of the funding for the project. Gates, who dropped out of Harvard in 1975 to co-found Microsoft, has provided funding to the university for climate research since 2007. The article shared in the Facebook post also falsely claims that the experiment will ""kick off in June."" The project originally was scheduled to have a test flight in Sweden in June 2021, but a Harvard advisory committee delayed it until at least 2022 in order to study potential impacts. An article headline says, ""Bill Gates hatches 'horribly stupid' plan to block out the sun."" Gates did not create such a plan. He is among the donors to a program that’s funding a small-scale experiment proposed by Harvard researchers that would spray aerosols into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight back into space. The experiment would measure the risks and effectiveness of the technology and is not an effort at widespread implementation",False,"February 25, 2022"
“Facebook is spamming all climate articles by misleading readers about” the accuracy of climate models.,"People across the political spectrum are critical of the influence Facebook wields over the flow of information. Now, a blog that’s skeptical of humans’ impact on the climate says Facebook is putting a spin on the facts it puts in front of users. The blog, Watts Up With That, said in a recent post that ""Facebook is spamming all climate articles by misleading readers about temperature measurements."" This complaint is aimed at Facebook’s practice of placing a link to its Climate Science Center information page on posts that may deal with climate change. Here’s how the link shows up: The page is a collection of facts, charts and articles related to climate change science, along with links to sources of scientific information. ""These facts from climate researchers correct common misconceptions about global warming and its impact,"" it says. It covers a number of points, among them, the use of climate change models that scientists use to project changes in temperature and analyze other patterns. The Jan. 31 post on Watts Up With That takes issue with Facebook’s assertion that these models are reliable. It argues that Facebook leaves out information that would show you can’t really count on the models.  Is Facebook misleading the public about the accuracy of climate models? We took a look. (PolitiFact partners with Facebook to assess statements posted on its platform and receives payment for that work.) The models at issue are computer models that simulate weather patterns over time to help scientists project how overall conditions will change as more greenhouse gases get into the atmosphere. They apply the basic rules of physics, such as the conservation of energy and mass, to factors such as air temperature, pressure, wind patterns and more.  Each run of a model produces results from those calculations to estimate changes in temperatures, rainfall, ice cover and sea level around the globe. ""The way scientists predict changes in climate patterns has proven to be reliable,"" Facebook’s climate science page says, in a summary that cites NASA as a source.  It notes successes in predicting global temperature increases, the course of Arctic warming and the divergence between temperatures in the upper atmosphere and lower atmosphere.  Eric Porterfield, spokesman for Meta, the company that owns Facebook, said the climate change center aims to cite ""organizations that are coming to independent conclusions and are not politically swayed."" In addition to NASA, the center links to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration and the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The page also addresses skeptics of the models. ""The myth that climate models are not reliable wrongly assumes that they are based on guesses and assumptions,"" it says. ""In fact, they’re based on the laws of physics and have proven records of accuracy."" The blog post from Watts Up accuses Facebook of failing to give readers complete information. It says the social media platform ""conceals"" cautionary words from international climate experts about climate forecasting.  For instance, it cites a passage from the 2013 IPCC report that says, ""The scenarios should be considered plausible and illustrative, and do not have probabilities attached to them."" The post characterizes this as saying the models are ""speculative."" The post goes on to say ""climate models grossly overstate global climate temperature anomaly impacts."" It provides a 2016 chart from a University of Alabama climatologist that shows the results of models for how rising greenhouse gas levels would affect temperatures in the tropical mid-troposphere, at least a mile above the Earth’s surface. The average temperatures predicted by the models were higher than actual observations from satellites and weather balloons. Both examples are misleading. The part of the 2013 report about ""illustrative scenarios"" was talking about the human factors that are always tough to predict, like whether future governments would clamp down on greenhouse gas emissions, or the pace of economic growth. Both would affect levels of atmospheric carbon, but they have nothing to do with the way the models themselves were built. As for the chart — versions of which appeared in a 2017 House hearing and circulate widely online — climate researchers have pointed out a number of flaws and limitations in it. High on the list of issues is the particular slice of the atmosphere it focuses on, the mid-troposphere, where temperatures are difficult to measure. Models for that part of the atmosphere did overshoot the actual temperatures, but not by as much as the chart suggests. Zeke Hausfather, a data scientist at the University of California Berkeley Energy and Resources Group, downplayed the chart’s significance. ""Models are not perfect, but it makes a lot more sense to evaluate their performance on surface temperatures for the globe where we all live, rather than cherry picking a layer of the atmosphere a mile up,"" Hausfather said. It’s much easier to measure temperatures at the surface, which means the data about surface temperatures is more accurate, and there are many more readings to draw on, compared with using satellites and balloons. Better data makes for better model performance. Hausfather co-wrote a study with NASA scientists that measured the results of 17 climate models of global average temperatures against actual readings. They found that 10 models were on target, and another four would have been, if they had known more precisely how much carbon dioxide pollution the global economy would produce. NASA’s page on climate models features this work. In addition, it cites older work by researchers who assessed the accuracy of the models used in 2004. They looked back (called a hindcast) to see how well the models’ results matched the past, and looked forward, to see how well they matched what actually happened after the model was run. The chart below shows the comparison. Remember, this is for average surface temperatures across the globe. The red line is observed temperatures. The black line is the average of the modeled results. The accuracy was generally good.  Source: NASA The IPCC has an ongoing program to assess the accuracy of climate change models.  In their latest report in 2021, IPCC researchers wrote that ""climate models have improved and continue to do so."" While some models do better than others, they found no broad pattern of overestimating or underestimating temperatures. ""Both the current and previous generations of models show that increases in greenhouse gases cause global warming,"" they said. We reached out to the Watts Up blog but did not hear back. The Watts Up With That blog said ""Facebook is spamming all climate articles by misleading readers about"" the accuracy of climate models. The article misrepresented cautionary words about climate change models from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It shared a chart that relies on cherry picked data to undercut the reliability of models. The great majority of climate researchers worldwide have data that shows models do an increasingly good job of capturing temperature changes at the surface.

Images show how climate change destroyed the Greenland ice sheet and harmed a polar bear from 2009 to 2019.,"The 10-years challenge has been making the rounds on Facebook, with users sharing photos of how they’ve changed within the last decade.  A climate change advocacy group got in on the trend by using purported then-and-now photos of a polar bear and an aerial view of Greenland, showing dramatic changes. Climate change is the ""10 years challenge we should really care about,"" the group’s Jan. 12 post said. The image, shared by a Facebook page called Green New Deal, shows two split images: one of the ice on Greenland being heavily diminished and another showing a healthy polar bear in 2009 and an emaciated bear in 2019.    The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) With the ""2009 and ""2019"" time stamps, the post gives the impression that the images depict changes that happened over that 10-year span. That’s not the case. While climate change has affected Greenland’s ice sheet and polar bears, the Facebook post is exaggerated. PolitiFact reached out to The Other 98%, the group that runs the page account, and their CEO John Sellers responded to say they deleted the image from all of their pages. We found similar posts shared across Facebook. A search of NASA images show that the area of land in the picture is Greenland, which experts also confirmed. (Greenland is geographically in North America, but it belongs to the kingdom of Denmark.) The post portrays the huge island’s ice sheet as almost wiped away as of 2019.  Greenland did have record ice loss of 532 billion tons in 2019, according to NASA. The ice loss added 1.5 millimeters to the average global sea level, which NASA said was enough to cover California with 4 feet of water. Still, satellite images taken by NASA that year show it looks nothing like the Facebook post. The image makes ""no sense,"" said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado Boulder. ""It seems to be showing the Greenland ice sheet present day (left) compared to some rendition of what the island would look like without an ice sheet,"" Serreze told PolitiFact.  Serreze said it would be ""many centuries"" at current warming rates before the Greenland ice sheet disappears. The ice sheet makes up 80% of Greenland and is the second-largest ice sheet in the world, behind the Antarctic ice sheet. The picture of the emaciated bear was not actually taken in 2019.  In 2015, a photographer named Kerstin Langenberger spotted the bear in the Svalbard archipelago in the Arctic Ocean east of Greenland and took a photo of it, drawing the conclusion that the bear’s poor condition was due to climate change. Langenberger’s picture garnered media attention, including from the CBC in Canada.  But even a defender of polar bears wasn’t buying it. ""When you get claims that this picture of this particular bear is evidence of climate change then you’ve crossed a bridge too far,"" said Geoff York, Polar Bears International's senior director of conservation, in a CBC interview. Another expert pointed out that it’s unlikely that the images show the same polar bear. Andrew Derocher, professor in the department of biological sciences at the University of Alberta in Canada, said none of the 19 polar bear populations monitored in Alaska, Canada, Norway and Greenland have gone through such a shift in overall body condition within a 10-year period. The skinny bear’s grim condition could have been due to reasons other than climate change, like disease, advanced age and injury.  ""Yes, individuals undergo changes in condition, but an animal (in) such an advanced stage of malnutrition is an extreme situation and not what has been observed on a population level,"" Derocher said. Jennifer Francis, acting deputy director and senior scientist at the Woodell Climate Research Center in Massachusetts, said there are studies, like one published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Climate Change, that indicate polar bears’ health is declining due to rapid sea ice loss.

Moore tweeted this claim in 2019: ""Polar bears have increased 400% in 45 years; whales are nearly fully recovered; extinctions are down 90% past century (IUCN). Koalas are doing fine. If we could ban wind turbines we could save 85,000 birds of prey/yr in US alone.""

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Agence France Presse first fact-checked elements of the claim two years ago, calling it misleading. Experts we talked to agree that the statistical claims are unsupported.  Here we look at each part of the claim individually: It’s impossible to compare the global population of polar bears to 45 years ago, because scientific estimates for most of the world’s polar bear populations weren’t published until after the mid-1970s, said Andrew Derocher, professor in the department of biological sciences at the University of Alberta in Canada. ""Many of the 19 polar bear populations (e.g., east Greenland, Laptev Sea, Arctic Basin, Kara Sea) have never had a population estimate and lack trend data, so it is impossible to say what the global population was 45 years ago or for that matter, what the global population size is today,"" Derocher said.  Derocher pointed to data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Polar Bear Specialist Group, which published its first estimate in 1993. That year, IUCN’s global estimate of polar bears was 21,470 to 28,370. Its estimates were 22,000 to 27,000 in 1997, 21,500 to 25,000 in 2001, and 20,000 to 25,000 in 2005 and 2009. In July 2021, the global estimate was 26,000.  The threat to polar bear populations 50 years ago was unregulated commercial, sport and subsistence hunting, Derocher said. A 1973 international treaty called the Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears blocked overhunting, Philip Newell, associate director of science defense at Climate Nexus, told PolitiFact.  Today, Derocher said, polar bears face another threat: global warming.  Experts differ on how much climate change has affected polar bears. Charles Greene, senior fellow at Friday Harbor Laboratories at the University of Washington, said the loss of ice in the Arctic Ocean has had some effect on polar bear populations, but not a major one so far. He pointed to two graphs published in 2014 that estimated their population — one showed a modest decline, while the other showed virtually no change. Still, both Greene and Derocher agreed there’s no evidence that polar bears have increased by 400%.  The practice of whaling decimated the whale population over the 20th century, said Greene. He pointed to figures from a pair of studies cited by Our World in Data, showing the whale population dwindled from an estimated 2.56 million in the 1890s to 879,412 by 2001.  While some countries, including Japan and Norway, still allow whale hunting, most have agreed to stop, Greene said. As a result of that and other international agreements, whale populations have recovered somewhat, but they’re nowhere near where they were when whaling was common. ""The thing that prevents them from recovering even faster is that even though we’re not intentionally whaling, we are unintentionally whaling by them getting hit by ships, by them getting entangled in fishing gear,"" said Greene. ""So for many species, blue whales, humpbacks in the Pacific, and right whales in the North Atlantic, those are the main sources of mortality now."" That could be enough to make right whales extinct within a few decades, Greene added. The North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium reported that the whale species’ numbers had dropped to 336 in 2020, the lowest number in nearly 20 years. Moore’s tweet cites the IUCN as a source for his claim that extinctions have dropped 90%. But we found no evidence to support that number, On the contrary, groups tracking biodiversity point to rising threats of extinction over the past century. In 2019, the ​​Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services  said, ""the average abundance of native species in most major land-based habitats has fallen by at least 20%, mostly since 1900.""  The IPBES also reported that since the 1600s, at least 680 vertebrate species have gone into extinction. More than 9% of all domesticated mammals used for food and agriculture became extinct in 2016. The IPBES count of endangered animals included 40% of amphibians, 33% of reef-forming corals, a third of all marine mammals, and more.  The IUCN reports that it has more than 142,500 species on its ""red list"" of threatened species, and more than 40,000 are in threat of extinction.  ""I couldn’t even begin to find anything that would suggest that extinctions have gone down,"" Greene told PolitiFact. ""It didn’t take me very long to go and pull out very recent papers from top tier journals that demonstrate that it’s a totally bogus claim.""  In 2016, the IUCN declared that koalas, which are native to Australia, were on the decline and categorized them as vulnerable. The group listed several threats, including residential and commercial development, logging and wood harvesting, and more.  An IUCN  fact sheet notes that koalas are affected by dangers including elevated CO2 levels in the plants they eat, predatory animals, vehicles, droughts and bushfires, diseases and habitat destruction.   AFP reported in its 2019 fact-check that the exact number of koalas was contested by different experts. But they did agree that koalas were not, in fact, fine. Birds do have deadly encounters with wind turbines. According to a June 2021 study published on the open-access journal Ecosphere, birds of prey with ""relatively higher potential of population-level impacts from wind turbine collisions included barn owl, ferruginous hawk, golden eagle, American kestrel, and red-tailed hawk."" However, wind turbines have a much smaller effect on birds of prey than other risk factors do. In response to a similar 2016 claim from candidate Donald Trump about ""hundreds and hundreds"" of eagles being killed by wind turbines, experts told us that the number of eagles killed was closer to 100, and that the birds could be easily saved with ""proper siting and mitigation measures.""  A 2020 article from Eletrek, a news site focused on sustainable energy and electric transportation, reported that while raptors can be killed by wind turbines, factors like agriculture, deforestation, fossil fuels, climate change, cats and windows have proven to be far more dangerous.  We didn’t find a basis for Moore’s claim that 85,000 raptors a year could be saved. We reached out to him for evidence for his claim in its entirety, but he did not return our query.  A Facebook post shared a 2019 claim that said polar bears’ populations had increased 400% in the last 45 years, whales were nearly fully recovered, that koalas were doing fine, and extinctions fell 90% in the past century. There are issues with each part of the claim. Experts said scientific estimates about the number of polar bears weren’t published until after the mid-1970s, so it’s impossible to compare today’s population to 45 years ago. Global estimates point to a modest decline or virtually no change in polar bear populations in recent decades. There is no evidence that whale populations have nearly fully recovered under whaling restrictions, or even come close. Koalas have been listed as vulnerable since 2016. We found no evidence to support the claim that extinctions are down by 90% in the past century. There have been several reports that wind turbines do kill raptors, but not nearly as many birds as the claim suggests.

A chart shows China and India are leading in per capita carbon dioxide emissions.,"Are China and India wildly outpacing the U.S., United Kingdom, Germany and Japan on emissions of carbon dioxide? A chart shared on Facebook shows a staggering increase in carbon dioxide emissions in China and India since 1990, while showing declines for the U.S. and other developed countries over the same time. On Facebook, a user sharing the chart asked: ""Why are we weakening our economy?"" They cited the New York Post as the source. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  This is the image from the Facebook post, which originated from a New York Post opinion article. It’s important to know what the chart shows, and what it doesn’t. It’s important to know what the chart shows, and what it doesn’t. While the headline on the graphic says ""Per capita CO2 emissions,"" what the lines on the chart show is the percentage change in CO2 emissions from 1990 to 2019 for China, India, Japan, the U.S., Germany and the United Kingdom.  It appeared alongside an Oct. 26 opinion article in the New York Post headlined ""Why destroy our economy to cut emissions — when China and India are spewing away?"" The piece ran ahead of the international climate change conference of world leaders in Glasgow, Scotland, called COP26.  The opinion article, written by Eddie Scarry, sourced the data in the chart from Our World in Data, a project of Oxford University. So we asked Hannah Ritchie, a senior researcher for Our World in Data, to tell us more about it.  Ritchie offered a simple explanation: Because China and India had very low levels of per capita emissions in 1990, when their economies were far less developed, their emissions have grown a lot since then. Readers wouldn’t know it from this graphic, but the U.S., U.K., Germany and Japan already had high levels of emissions, which didn’t change very much over the same period. A different way of looking at the data provides more context.  Our World in Data provided a similar chart looking at per capita CO2 emissions for the same countries and time periods. The difference in this chart is that it shows not the percentage change, but rather the actual change in per capita emissions over time, measured in tons. This version of how the data is presented shows the U.S. and Japan leading in per capita CO2 emissions.  The difference in charts from Our World in Data depends on whether the ""relative change"" option was selected. Checking this box shows the percentage change over time and makes it appear as though China and India are leading in CO2 emissions compared with other developed nations.  The Facebook post is missing context because it shows the change in emissions per person, but not the actual emissions.  The United States is responsible for the largest share of historical emissions with about 509 gigatons of carbon dioxide released since 1850. China has the second-largest share of historical emissions with more than 284 gigatons. Simon Evans, deputy editor for Carbon Brief, analyzed why cumulative CO2 emissions matter in an Oct. 5, 2021, article. He wrote:  ""There is a direct, linear relationship between the total amount of CO2 released by human activity and the level of warming at the Earth’s surface. Moreover, the timing of a ton of CO2 being emitted has only a limited impact on the amount of warming it will ultimately cause. ""This means CO2 emissions from hundreds of years ago continue to contribute to the heating of the planet — and current warming is determined by the cumulative total of CO2 emissions over time.""  A Facebook post shows China and India leading in per capita CO2 emissions compared to the U.S., U.K., Germany and Japan between 1990 and 2019.  The chart is missing some context, and the headline is misleading. When looking at the percentage change in per capita CO2 emissions from 1990-2019, China and India have seen the largest increases. Both countries had relatively low emissions in 1990, and they have grown a lot since then. The U.S., U.K., Germany and Japan already had high levels of emissions in 1990, and they have remained at high levels, with the U.S. leading the pack",Half True,"December 2, 2021"
"“Within two years, there were two 500-year (storm) events” in Wisconsin.","In July 2016, northern Wisconsin was battered by severe storms that devastated the area.  The storms led to flash flooding, which overwhelmed small creeks and rivers and washed out roads. Culverts overflowed along rural roads, with the water damage leaving them no longer drivable.  More than 80 boats were damaged or destroyed in Saxon Harbor, where the heavy rainfall caused flooding that almost washed away boat slips and trees, and pipes and cement culverts up from the ground, according to a July 2016 report from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.  Rainfall totals reached 14 inches in some parts of the Northwoods. A broad swath of destruction lingered for years in its path, according to a July 2021 report from the Wausau Daily Herald.  In June 2018, heavy rains pummeled the Northwoods again, dropping 10 or more inches of rain in some areas, according to the National Weather Service.  U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, cited the two storms in a Nov. 6, 2021 panel discussion at the United Nations Climate Change conference, highlighting how unusually  strong the storms have gotten in Wisconsin since she took office.  ""Within two years, there were two 500-year events,"" she said.  But were the storms really that strong?  First, let’s take a look at what a 500-year storm is. It has nothing to do with five centuries of history. A 500-year storm is an event with a 1-in-500 chance of occurring, according to the United States Geological Survey, or an annual probability of occurrence of around .2%.  That is, it’s just a way of defining the statistical probability of a severe storm. For instance, just because there were 11 inches of rain in one day in one year, doesn’t mean that Wisconsin won’t see 11 inches of rain in one day again for another 500 years.  In theory, these types of events with such low statistical probabilities are rare, meaning that it might not make sense for cities, engineers and others to plan around the possibility of them happening -- though that is being rethought, as 500-year storms and floods are happening more often due to climate change, according to an August 2017 report from Vox.  When we asked Baldwin’s team about her claim that the storms were both 500-year events, they sent a host of links from the National Weather Service with data from both events.  According to the data, the 2016 storm did indeed reach the threshold for a 500-year storm in some places, including the community of Saxon Harbor. In other places, the storm reached even higher thresholds.  The storms that pummelled the area in 2018 also reached similar thresholds, with some areas sustaining 500-year rainfalls or higher, according to the NWS.  But the Northwoods aren’t the only area where severe storms have risen to the same 500-year level. Storms in southern parts of the state around the same time also met that definition.  So, Baldwin is a bit off -- though in a way that actually reinforces the point she was making. Daniel Vimont, a professor of atmospheric and oceanic science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said Madison received more than 11 inches of rain on August 21 2018. The threshold for a 500-year rainfall within 24 hours is 9.5 inches.   Then on Aug. 28, 2018, Cashton received over 10 inches of rain within 24 hours, which again rose to the level of a 500-year storm.  Baldwin claimed that since she took office, two ""500-year"" storm events occurred in northern Wisconsin.  Data from the National Weather Service shows that 500-year storms did indeed strike the northernmost counties in Wisconsin in 2016 and 2018, overwhelming creeks and rivers.  But storms in Cashton and Madison in 2018 lso rose to the same level, meaning that there have been more than two such storms within two years in the state.  So Baldwin actually undershot the number of high-impact storms within the state between 2016 and 2018",Mostly True,"November 30, 2021"

“Global warming is part of (a) natural cycle and there’s nothing we can actually do to stop these cycles.”,"During the U.N’s global summit on climate change in Scotland, Facebook users shared a viral image claiming that global warming occurs naturally, and that humans are not part of the cause. The image contains a photo of a man and this quote, attributed to Dr. David Bellamy: ""Global warming is part of (a) natural cycle and there’s nothing we can actually do to stop these cycles. The world is now facing spending a vast amount of money in tax to try to solve a problem that doesn’t actually exist."" The posts, including one by a Facebook page named  ""Climate Change is Crap,"" were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The photo is of Bellamy, an English botanist who died in 2019. The scientist and onetime TV broadcaster uttered the quote in a 2008 interview, where he reiterated his opinion that warming is not man made. The current scientific consensus is that humans do cause climate change.  It dates back at least to when PolitiFact began fact-checking such claims in 2007, when we found that the overwhelming consensus among climate scientists was that humans are the main cause of global warming. In a landmark report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released Aug. 9, 234 authors relying on more than 14,000 studies said ""it is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land.""  The report said that it has ""high confidence"" that the main driver of increased frequency and intensity of hot extremes experienced over most land regions since the 1950s is human-induced climate change.  It is also ""likely,"" the report said, that human influence has resulted in a greater frequency of concurrent heatwaves and droughts on the global scale, fires in some regions and compound flooding in some places. NASA explains the consensus around human contributions to climate change this way: ""Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that human activities are the primary cause of the observed climate-warming trend over the past century,"" and multiple studies ""show that 97% or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree: Climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities."" NASA explains that the Earth’s climate has changed throughout history and, over 800,000 years, most of those changes are due to small variations in the Earth’s orbit, which affects how much solar energy the planet receives. But today’s trends are not a result of just variations to Earth’s orbit. NASA says there’s a greater than 95% probability that most of the current warming trend is the result of human activity since the mid-20th century. Increased levels of so-called greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, cause the Earth to warm by blocking heat from escaping the atmosphere and radiating it back toward the Earth’s surface.  Carbon dioxide can be released through, say, volcanic eruptions, but humans have also increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide by 47% since the Industrial Revolution started. Methane can likewise be produced through both natural sources and human activities, such as agriculture and livestock manure management. ""Human activities are changing the natural greenhouse,"" NASA says. ""Over the last century the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, the clearing of land for agriculture, industry and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases."" A viral image claims: ""Global warming is part of (a) natural cycle and there’s nothing we can actually do to stop these cycles."" The quote is from an English botanist from 2008. It does not reflect the current scientific consensus, which is that human activity does contribute to global warming",False,"November 3, 2021"
“Greenland's ice sheet isn't shrinking any more rapidly today than it was 80 years ago.”,"Steven Koonin, a former Obama administration official and unofficial adviser to the EPA under President Donald Trump, says the fears of rampant climate change are overblown. In a recent video for the conservative group Prager U, Koonin noted several trends that ought to reassure people. Among them, the ice in Greenland. ""Greenland's ice sheet isn't shrinking any more rapidly today than it was 80 years ago,"" said Koonin, now a New York University professor of physics. Koonin told us he based this on a widely accepted study of the Greenland ice sheet and rising sea levels. The main problem is that study only went through 2010, and ice losses have accelerated since then. There’s been a steeper and longer lasting decline in recent decades compared with the pre-World War II period Koonin mentioned. Greenland lost ice faster this decade than 80 years ago. Read the full fact-check in our bio. ##ClimateChange ##LearnOnTikTok The Greenland ice sheet is second only to the Antarctic in size, covering about 660,000 square miles. It is a key barometer of climate change, and its fate has great importance for overall sea level changes and impacts on ocean currents. Measuring Greenland’s ice involves much more than just tracking the area it covers. Researchers need to factor in the amount of snowfall that adds to its mass, and weigh that against the millions of gallons of water that evaporate into the atmosphere or melt into the water. Plus, in a process called calving, large chunks break off and drift away as icebergs. Satellites provide some of the best information to track trends in the ice, but they date back only to the early 1990s. Before then, the best data came from aerial photographs in the 1930s and 1940s. When the underlying terrain is known, scientists compare pictures over the years to tell what happened with the ice. Using historic air and sea measurements and computer models, researchers can push the estimates of the mass of the ice as far back as the mid-1800s. Koonin told us that he relied on an article about the role of melting ice on rising sea levels. The August 2020 paper noted two periods when Greenland ice added the most to the oceans — around 1940 and after about 1990. The highest amount came in 1937 when Greenland’s ice sheet caused the sea level to rise by .76 millimeters. In 2010, the ice sheet added .7 millimeters to the oceans. (Measuring rising sea levels due to the Greenland ice sheet and measuring ice loss from the sheet are two sides of the same coin.) The main issue with this data is that it stops at 2010. The latest report card for the Greenland ice sheet from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that in 2012 and 2019, the ice sheet saw its greatest losses since regular monitoring began in the 1950s. In 2012, it shed about 464 gigatons, and in 2019, it lost about 532 gigatons. According to NASA, 1 gigaton of ice would cover Central Park in New York and reach 1,119 feet high. ""Following a period of relative stability from the 1970s to early 1990s, the ice sheet began losing ice at an accelerating rate and has now experienced annual net ice loss every year since 1998,"" the report said. Many of the researchers who worked on that analysis were part of a project that pulled together multiple ways of measuring the mass of Greenland’s ice and built a tool that tracks the ice nearly in real time. They made the full data tables available and, with the help of one of those collaborators, Kristian Kjeldsen at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland in Denmark, we summarized the ice loss trends decade by decade. The overall trend is that losses have been more sustained and deeper than during the pre-WWII period that Koonin referred to in his video. All studies of the Greenland ice sheet find that the numbers bounce around a lot from year to year. Averages for each decade help smooth out the trends. Even with the best methods, pinpoint accuracy is out of reach, and the shaded areas show the high and low estimates, with the solid line showing the mid-points. The further back in time, the bigger the uncertainty. ""Some observations point to a warm period in the late 1920s and early 1930s, which coincides with glacier retreat in the southeast,"" Kjeldsen said. But he noted, after 2000, negative numbers are ""more persistent."" The 1930s low point of 206 gigatons of ice sheet loss is not as large as the 247 gigatons average yearly loss between 2010 and 2020.  We counted the years of continuous decline. The current stretch of year-on-year losses since 1998 is the longest this century. (We reworked the yearly numbers several ways, looking at five-year periods and average changes during periods of ice loss. The overall trends remained the same.)  Researcher Twila Moon, deputy lead scientist with the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado, said the tons of ice lost today actually are more significant than losses in the 1930s. Back then, the ice sheet was bigger. ""After losing ice in the earlier part of the 20th century, the ice sheet did not expand back to its previous mass and shape,"" Moon said. ""So as warming air and ocean temperatures arrived in the later part of the 20th century, the ice loss was picking up from a different starting point."" We shared the latest numbers with Koonin, and he highlighted the uncertainties in the estimates. By his calculations, there’s about a 40% chance that the losses were greater in the 1930s than in the 2010s. There are different ways to calculate the odds. Andrew Dessler, professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, estimated that there’s about a 25% chance that the losses were greater in the 1930s than in the 2010s.  In either scenario, using either estimate, that would mean there’s a greater chance the ice losses were greater in the 2010s than the 1930s. Koonin said that ""Greenland's ice sheet isn't shrinking any more rapidly today than it was 80 years ago."" Koonin relied on a study that had data through 2010. Experts agree that a period of warmer temperatures caused a large loss of ice in the 1930s. But the most recent data shows a period of steeper and longer lasting declines in the Greenland ice sheet between 2010 and 2020 than in the period 80 years ago. There is uncertainty in the data, but Koonin’s numbers are incomplete and obscure the scale of recent ice losses",Mostly False,"November 3, 2021"
"The Biden administration ""published a study concluding 4 (of) 5 new cars on the road by 2050 will still require liquid fuels.""","President Joe Biden was in Michigan’s auto industry hub on Oct. 5 when he said, ""the whole world knows that the future of the auto industry is electric."" Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, had a quick response, writing on Twitter: "".@POTUS no it’s not — in fact, your own administration published a study concluding 4/5 new cars on the road by 2050 will still require liquid fuels ... ""It’s past time Biden lives up to his promise to expand clean-burning #biofuels. Don’t mess with the RFS!"" Feenstra is correct about the share of cars in the United States projected to use liquid fuels. The U.S. Energy Information Administration’s 2021 Annual Energy Outlook report, which projects the nation’s environmental plans through 2050, says about 79% of new vehicle sales will be powered by liquid fuels — gasoline and blends that include up to 85% ethanol — in 2050. They accounted for 95% of sales in 2020, the report states. PolitiFact contacted Feenstra’s communications staff over 10 times for comment but did not receive a response. However, Feenstra’s tweet shared the link to his sourcing, and on page 15, the federal report notes that, while electric energy’s biggest demand growth area is transportation, the share will be small — less than 3%: ""Current laws and regulations are not projected to induce much market growth, despite continuing improvements in electric vehicles (EVs) through evolutionary market developments. Both vehicle sales and utilization (miles driven) would need to increase substantially for EVs to raise electric power demand growth rates by more than a fraction of a percentage point per year."" And, on the report’s page 26: ""Because most light-duty vehicles have internal combustion engines, motor gasoline remains the major transportation fuel through 2050 as personal travel returns to pre-pandemic per-driver levels in the longer term.""  While 2050 is 29 years down the road, Biden did not state in Michigan a time limit on when he thinks electric power would come close to liquid fuels’ share of the automobile market. Nor did he state in detail what that future for electric power for automobiles would be. His administration’s Annual Energy Outlook reports that it is not predicting future energy use; rather it is a projection based on assumptions and methodologies that can be changed when subjected to changes in technology, demographics and resources. The report also notes that it is a response to the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977. That law requires the U.S. Energy Information Administration to produce annual reports on trends and projections for energy use and supply, the report notes. But Feenstra was precise with his facts, and is not alone reminding Biden to support biofuels. Other Iowa congressional members, Republican and Democrat, have pushed for biofuels support, regardless of who is president. So has the biofuels industry. The reason? Iowa leads the nation when it comes to producing biofuels from farm crops. It has capacity to produce 4.6 billion gallons, double the 2.3 billion in the No. 2 state, Nebraska. While we focused this story on predicted biofuels use in vehicles, it’s worth noting that Biden promised support for biofuels in a Sept. 9, 2020, campaign statement that criticized a pre-election policy reversal by then-President Donald Trump on biofuels. Trump’s reversal led to his administration’s rejection of oil refinery industry requests to be exempt from requirements to blend certain amounts of ethanol and biodiesel in gasoline: ""A Biden-Harris Administration will fight for family farmers and revitalize rural economies — from keeping our promises to farmers by ushering in a new era of biofuels, to investing in the broadband infrastructure and rural health care access that families and communities need,"" the Biden statement read. Trump reversed course again and approved on Jan. 19, 2021, just before leaving office, three biofuel waivers for refineries. Feenstra said the Biden Administration predicts that four out of five new cars on the road will require liquid fuels in 2050 and he cites the source.

Climate-change skeptics have delighted in pointing out the shortage of electric vehicle charging stations in Glasgow, Scotland, site of the upcoming international climate change summit known as COP26. ""More Embarrassment: COP26 Luxury EVs to be Recharged Using Diesel Generators,"" said a headline on the website Watt’s Up With That on Oct. 24. The conservative website Zero Hedge quipped Oct. 16, ""Maybe since we're gathered to talk about the negative effect on the climate, we could at least start by finding a carbon neutral way to shuttle yourself back and forth to the event."" A plain reading would suggest that electric vehicles were being recharged by burning ordinary diesel fuel.  That’s not what’s going on. Yes, generators are being used for recharging, but people who read just a bit further would see that the generators will burn a type of vegetable oil, a fuel with significantly lower emissions than diesel.  The fuel is called a biodiesel, but it’s fossil-free and chemically quite different from standard petroleum-based diesel fuel. A number of dignitaries will be staying at hotels that are some distance from the conference site, in some cases as much as 45 miles away. In September, the U.K. government announced that Jaguar Land Rover would provide electric cars and SUVs to shuttle people back and forth. According to Reuters, the automaker is providing 240 vehicles. There aren’t enough charging stations to top off the batteries for that many cars overnight. To fill the gap, as The Scotsman reported Oct. 9, the conference organizers will deploy generators powered by waste vegetable oil. The U.K. COP26 office said they would run on hydrotreated vegetable oil. Hydrotreated vegetable oil is less polluting than diesel. A 2018 comparison found the biofuel ""resulted in a significant reduction of all regulated emissions."" RELATED VIDEO 
  That included a 75% reduction in soot, 35% in carbon monoxide, at least 20% fewer  hydrocarbons, and about 6% less carbon dioxide. With nitric oxides, the results were mixed. Under some conditions, emissions were lower with hydrotreated vegetable oil. Under others, emissions were higher.  Hydrotreated vegetable oil is actually a second-generation biofuel and is broadly seen as more sustainable than the first biofuels based on products like soybeans and rapeseed. The European Union plans to use hydrotreated vegetable oil more in the next decade. While this fuel might be cleaner than diesel, climate change activists criticized the organizers for lack of planning, and suggested the delegates could ride electric buses instead of cars and SUVs.  Bloggers said the organizers of the COP26 climate change summit were using diesel generators to recharge electric vehicle batteries. Organizers are using generators, but they run on a type of vegetable oil that has much lower emissions than diesel fuel. The fuel, hydrotreated vegetable oil, is sometimes called a biodiesel, but it is not a fossil fuel and is chemically distinct from diesel",Mostly False,"October 26, 2021"
“U.S. acres burned each year are much fewer now — even in our worst years — than was the case in the early 20th century.”,"The wildfire season in the U.S. has gotten longer. In recent decades, what once lasted four months has grown to six or even eight months. Climate change makes summers warmer, but past forest management has also left forests with more fuel to ignite. An article from the conservative Heartland Institute argues that the role of climate change is ""grossly overemphasized.""  ""U.S. acres burned each year are much fewer now — even in our worst years — than was the case in the early 20th century,"" the Oct. 11 article said. The author points to U.S. government data that shows a dramatic drop in the number of acres burned, from over 40 million in 1930 down to 10 million around 2015. The problem is, federal officials have known for some time that their data was unreliable, and this year, they took most of it off their website (which drew accusations of cherry picking the numbers from the Heartland Institute). Many factors made the data shaky. Perhaps the most intriguing part of this story of bad data is that the government’s old information includes millions of acres in the 1920s and 1930s that burned not by accident, but by intent. On top of that, there was also double counting, and, as some see it, undercounting. The Heartland Institute pointed to this chart to back up their claim about wildfire trends. The data came from the National Interagency Fire Center.  A fact-sheet from the conservative Heartland Institute used this chart based on federal data. If you go to the federal center’s wildfire page today, you will find this message: ""Prior to 1983, the federal wildland fire agencies did not track official wildfire data using current reporting processes. As a result, there is no official data prior to 1983 posted on this site."" A 2015 article from a Forest Service researcher explained why that data was unreliable. She wrote that multiple federal, state and local agencies filled out fire reports each in their own way, using different approaches to report different kinds of information. The article talked about records ""compromised by inherent reporting biases, inconsistencies and errors or uncertainty in the data."" There were instances when fires were counted twice, or more, said John Abatzoglou, a fire researcher at the University of California Merced. ""Some fires can be counted in triplicate as multiple agencies responding to the fire would count that fire in their summary statistics,"" Abatzoglou said. The Heartland article author, senior fellow H. Sterling Burnett, minimized that concern. ""It’s not that there isn’t any overcounting,"" Burnett said. ""But people managing federal agencies were smart enough to notice when two organizations reported the same fire."" As a record of the total number of acres burned over many years, historian Stephen Pyne, Arizona State University professor emeritus, said he thinks the government probably underestimated the damage. ""Most of the country outside federal lands was not counted at all,"" Pyne said.  The most certain conclusion about the government numbers behind the chart is that they can’t be trusted. But many experts who have dug into the archives talk about a major flaw that greatly inflated the federal statistics. They describe how conflict between the U.S. Forest Service and southern landowners likely threw off the totals by millions of acres. In a 2018 article, Randal O’Toole, a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute, included that same chart showing the dramatic fall in wildfires based on federal data. O’Toole is skeptical of broad claims of climate change. But O’Toole offered this chart with a stinging caption. ""Some people use the data behind this chart to argue against anthropogenic climate change. The problem is that the data before about 1955 are a lie."" O’Toole noted that at the turn of the 20th century, Congress told the Forest Service to suppress fires. This mandate put the federal agency in direct conflict with landowners in the southeast. The Forest Service was steadfast in its opposition to all fires. But the southeaster landowners burned their forests every four or five years to control underbrush. ""Perhaps 20% of forests would be burned each year, compared with less than 1% of forests burned through actual wildfires,"" O’Toole wrote. ""The Forest Service responded by counting all fires in that state, prescribed or wild, as wildfires."" There is broad agreement on this problem. ""The early U.S. Forest Service wildfire activity summaries do include millions of hectares of intentional burning on ‘unprotected’ lands, which, until approximately the mid-20th century was viewed by the U.S. Forest Service as akin to wildfire, as something that should be prevented and ultimately eradicated,"" the Forest Service researcher wrote in that 2015 article. That wasn’t exactly news. Researchers for an outside report commissioned by the Forest Service wrote in 2003 that ""in excess of 10 million acres were burned by wildfires annually"" between 1930 and 1950.  ""Most of the area burned during this period was in the Southeastern United States and were primarily incendiary fires,"" the authors wrote. (Incendiary fires are intentional fires.) We raised these issues of the unreliability of the federal database with Heartland’s Burnett. He said many articles in peer-reviewed journals had also relied on it. ""You can only go with the data you have,"" Burnett said. He said even if the numbers are flawed, the number of acres lost to wildfires today is still less than it was in 1930. That’s unlikely. No expert we reached knew of any national study that could fix the errors in the government’s original data. But there has been a lot of work done on the western states where the largest fires take place. Jeremy Littell with the Department of Interior Alaska Climate Science Center, along with several colleagues, examined fire reports for 11 western states — Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.  They used a blend of federal, state and regional reports, and they filtered out intentional fires, only counting burns on federal or federally-protected land. They looked at the years 1916 to 2020 The peak of 7.4 million acres burned came in 2012. But the next highest, 6.7 million, came in 1919. Among the top 20 highest years, a bit more than half, 13, took place after 1987. The rest came before 1932. The fact is, there were some huge fires at the turn of the century. ""The large fire years in the West between about 1916 and the late 1930s were comparable to those in recent years,"" Littell said. Littell said the triggers for large fires are the same today as they were in the first decades of the 1900s. Hot and dry summers in a preceding year lead to worse fire seasons. And since 1980, those conditions have become more common. The Heartland Institute said, ""U.S. acres burned each year are much fewer now  — even in our worst years —  than was the case in the early 20th century."" The claim was based on federal data. However, over the years, researchers concluded that the federal data was deeply flawed. While there might have been some undercounting, double and triple counting also took place. Most damaging of all, in the 1920s and 1930s, millions of acres of intentional fires in the southeast were counted as wildfires. One climate change skeptic called the government data ""a lie."" This year, the government withdrew its original dataset, and now only provides counts starting in 1983. There is no national level analysis going back to the turn of the last century, but an analysis of 11 western states suggests that the toll of fires today is at least on par with the fires in the first few decades",Mostly False,"October 15, 2021"
A wind turbine “could never generate as much energy as was invested in building it.”,"Wind farms are a pillar of America’s climate change strategy. They now produce over 8% of the nation’s electricity, and their output is expected to nearly double over the next decade. A Facebook post casts wind as a losing proposition. ""A windmill could spin until it falls apart and never generate as much energy as was invested in building it,"" a Sept. 16 version of the post says. This qualifies as a zombie claim. In 2019, we found an earlier version False, but it walks again. The image is topped with a striking photo of a wind turbine on fire (it comes from a March 2020 fire in Texas) and gives some details. ""A two-megawatt windmill is made up of 260 tonnes of steel that required 300 tonnes of iron ore and 170 tonnes of coking coal, all mined, transported and produced by hydrocarbons,"" the post says. (We corrected several typos in the text.) The post is wrong. From construction to demolition, the energy payback on a windmill can be less than a year. The highest estimate we found was a bit under six years. The numbers in the post come from a 2009 collection of essays on climate change and Canada. J. David Hughes, a geoscientist with the Geological Survey of Canada, wrote about the total energy package for wind turbines, a perspective that included how much energy it took to make the turbine, not just the energy it produced when it was operational. ""The question is: how long must a windmill generate energy before it creates more energy than it took to build it?"" Hughes wrote.  Hughes’s focus was on the need to put turbines in places where the wind blows. ""At a good wind site, the energy payback day could be in three years or less,"" Hughes wrote. ""In a poor location, energy payback may be never.""  The Facebook post skipped over that sentence, and jumped to Hughes’ warning, that in the wrong spot, a windmill ""could spin until it falls apart and never generate as much energy as was invested in building it."" (There’s a logical breakdown here: If a turbine is spinning, then the wind must be blowing, and the turbine is producing power.) Also, wind turbine technology has changed greatly over the past 10 years, as engineers have developed more efficient models and gained experience in siting windmills. The 2009 material is dated. For decades, researchers have been assessing all the steps that go into turning wind into electricity. Study after study has found that when all is said and done, a properly placed turbine nets out positive. A 2016 study from Danish engineers looked at onshore and offshore turbines and wrote, ""The energy payback time was found to be less than 1 year for all technologies."" A group of engineers in Texas did similar work and reported that ""the payback times for CO2 and energy consumption range from 6 to 14 and 6 to 17 months,"" with on-shore facilities having a shorter payback. There are many steps in the making of a wind turbine. The raw materials need to be mined, those materials need to be turned into rotors and towers and those parts need to be shipped. It takes energy to install a turbine, and a small bit of energy to operate it. And at the very end — after 20 to 30 years — it has to be dismantled and recycled. Research finds that as much as 86% of the total energy comes in the manufacturing step, although some studies found lower percentages. There are a few key variables, including how long the wind turbine lasts — manufacturing costs are baked in, and the longer a turbine lasts, the more years those costs get spread over. Another key variable is the wind. Turbines may have a predicted output, but the wind determines what really happens. One 2019 study from engineers at the University of Texas at Arlington factored in the wind speeds from a working wind farm in Texas with 200 turbines. It examined in detail the energy it took to move the turbine components from where they were made in Spain to the Lone Star Wind Farm near Abilene, Texas. It also measured the energy it took to get raw materials to the factories in Spain where manufacturing took place. The wind at the Lone Star Wind Farm varies and the researchers used that data to find the actual average wind speed through the year.  They calculated a turbine that lasts 20 years will reach a full energy payback in less than six years.  A viral image said that a wind turbine ""could never generate as much energy as was invested in building it."" The claim cherry-picked a quote from a book and distorted its meaning. Every study of the lifecycle of wind turbines finds that they produce more energy than it took to produce them. Most analyses put the energy payback period at about a year or so. The most conservative, real-world assessment we found calculated that wind turbines in Texas produced more electricity than it took to build them after about six years",False,"October 12, 2021"

""Bill Gates talked about using vaccines to control population growth, here is the unedited 2010 TED Talk video,"" the headline said. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  TechStartups included a YouTube clip of Gates’ 2010 TEDTalk presentation called ""Innovating to zero!"" His presentation focused on lowering carbon dioxide emissions down to zero.  In the clip, Gates introduces a mathematical equation to calculate the amount of global emissions and how to lower it. Part of that equation included the size of the global population.  ""The world today has 6.8 billion people. That's headed up to about 9 billion,"" Gates said. ""Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15%."" The full video is 27 minutes and available on the TEDTalk website. Gates’ comment about the population was a fragment of his speech. He spoke largely about the types of energy and actions that produce CO2, and proposed a solution of energy measures, like nuclear, wind and solar, that would reduce carbon dioxide emissions a great deal by 2050. His point about vaccines has been commonly misconstrued as a plot to depopulate the planet. In 2018, PolitiFact debunked a similar claim. Melinda Gates wrote this in the former couple's annual letter: ""When more children live past age five, and when mothers can decide if and when to have children, population sizes don’t go up. They go down. Parents have fewer children when they’re confident those children will survive into adulthood. Big families are in some ways an insurance policy against the tragic likelihood of losing a son or a daughter."" Bill Gates further outlined the idea in a separate video, showing a chart that illustrated the inclining growth rate of the world’s population and the effect of improving health care.  ""What we found is that as health improves, families choose to have less children, and this effect is very, very dramatic,"" Gates said. ""We find that in every country of the world, this is repeated.""   A website article claimed that Bill Gates advocated for reducing the global population by using vaccines during a 2010 TedTalk. Gates wasn’t talking about reducing the population through vaccination. He and his former wife Melinda have repeatedly said that child mortality is lowered when families have access to life-saving vaccines and health care, allowing families to choose to have fewer children",False,"October 11, 2021"
“The Democrats want you American taxpayers to shell out $3 billion for ‘non-racist’ trees.”,"One piece of the Democrats’ $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill — $3 billion for trees — is being ridiculed in a widely shared Facebook post.

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The phrase ""non-racist’ trees"" appears to be a mocking reference to a climate-change policy that proponents of the Democrats’ plans call tree equity. But the phrase mangles the definition of that concept. We asked FreedomWorks for information to back its claim. A spokesperson referred us to language in the bill. The $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill backed by Democrats includes many parts of President Joe Biden’s tax and spending proposals that have attracted little or no buy-in from Republicans, including expanded social programs and efforts to combat climate change.  Many in the GOP argue that the bill calls for too much spending, and that it could contribute to rising inflation. One provision proposes giving $3 billion in grants to state and local governments and nonprofits ""for tree planting and related activities to increase community tree canopy and associated societal and climate co-benefits, with a priority for projects that increase tree equity."" Priority would be given to ""a census block group in which 30% or more of the population lives below the poverty line; and a neighborhood with lower tree canopy and higher maximum daytime summer temperatures compared to surrounding neighborhoods""; and to ""underserved populations."" The conservation group American Forests issued a statement praising the bill.  The $3 billion would be an ""investment in planting equitable tree cover across our cities as protection against climate-fueled extreme heat and air pollution,"" the statement said. ""This new federal funding can feed the growing movement in cities across America, from Tucson to Boston, to make tree equity part of their push to equitably protect every neighborhood from climate change. This comes as some projections show we could see as many as 100,000 deaths per year in the U.S. from extreme heat before the end of the century."" The group’s website says trees are a ""pathway to social equity.""

FreedomWorks claimed in a Facebook post: ""The Democrats want you American taxpayers to shell out $3 billion for ‘non-racist’ trees."" The Democrats’ bill would set aside $3 billion to support tree planting with a priority for projects that increase tree equity.

"“As a result of the massive decline in natural gas prices, we’re saving 11,000 lives per year in the U.S.”","The chair of the House Republican Policy Committee, Rep. Gary Palmer, R-Ala., says he opposes the Democratic climate change plans because they will land heavily on families of modest means. In particular, Palmer warned that shifting toward clean energy will raise the price of natural gas at a time when tens of millions of Americans struggle to pay their energy bills.  ""This impacts low-income people,"" Palmer said Sept. 13 at a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. ""Higher energy costs literally lead to more weather-related deaths."" Palmer went on to say that the reverse is also true. ""There’s a study that indicated that as a result of the massive decline in natural gas prices that literally we’re saving 11,000 lives per year in the U.S.,"" he said. Palmer’s claim fairly represents the findings of a 2019 study on natural gas prices, but it takes a narrow view of the implications of Biden’s policies for combating climate change. And it leaves out important context about the connection between temperatures and mortality.  We reached out to Palmer’s office and did not hear back.  The 11,000 lives estimate comes from a 2019 paper from three economists that linked lower wintertime deaths to declines in natural gas prices between 2005 and 2010. They looked at the deaths from causes that are particularly high in winter — primarily cardiovascular and respiratory problems. They found that those deaths went down at the same time that natural gas prices fell. Accounting for a number of other possible factors, they said the ""price decline caused a 1.6% decrease in the winter mortality rate for households using natural gas for heating."" And they said that the impact of the lower price was greater for households making under 150% of the federal poverty level. One of the researchers, economist Seema Jayachandran at Northwestern University, said their working theory was that with lower fuel prices, people kept their homes warmer. Jayachandran acknowledged that the study didn’t consider all the implications of using more natural gas. ""We looked at mortality caused by households facing lower prices for home heating, but air pollution is another implication that we did not incorporate, and it affects mortality too,"" Jayachandran said. Public health researchers caution that the link between winter weather and mortality is poorly understood. One complicating factor is the seasonal flu. Its toll can vary greatly from year to year, as it did during the period in the study Palmer cited. A generally mild flu season, such as the one from 2006 to 2007, led to fewer deaths than the year before, quite apart from fuel prices or temperatures. ""We still don’t know that it’s the overall colder temperatures that cause the higher mortality in the winter,"" said University of Washington professor of environmental and occupational health Kristie Ebi. ""Many deaths don’t occur in the coldest places. Hypothermia is a higher risk in Houston than in New York City."" Ebi noted that if colder temperatures increased deaths, then warmer winter temperatures ought to reduce them. But ""despite warmer temperatures from 1985 to 2012, cold-attributed mortality increased in the U.S.,"" Ebi said. Other researchers —focused on the impact of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels like natural gas — look at deaths when it’s hot. In a 2020 study published in GeoHealth, a group of researchers estimated that higher temperatures caused 12,000 premature deaths each year in the U.S. A review of over 400 studies found that ""most research on household energy does not consider climate change."" But what that review found suggested that the effects of climate change are particularly dangerous for the very people Palmer mentioned at the hearing. ""Mortality from heat waves disproportionately affects older, minority and low-income residents who are less equipped socially, economically and physiologically to withstand high temperatures,"" the authors wrote. ""After the 1995 Chicago heat wave, there was a clear demographic disparity in mortality rates — lower-income and older people died at much higher rates than the rest of the population."" For perspective, today's natural gas prices are up from recent lows as economic activity recovers, but not even close to historical highs. They are about where they were in 2010. That said, the issue Palmer raises about natural gas costs is real. If the country seeks to cut back natural gas production to curb emissions, it’s possible that the price will rise. If that happens, low-income families that rely on natural gas would be vulnerable.  The Biden administration has plans to reduce those households’ energy bills by helping them consume less. It’s promoting programs to cut the cost of insulating and weatherproofing people’s homes and apartments. It wants to make home appliances more efficient. Whether that’s enough to offset the higher energy prices is an open question. ""Energy efficiency has historically helped to address some of the energy cost burdens for the poor, but it usually does not go far enough to really shield them from the economic shocks of high energy pricing,"" said Diana Hernandez, a researcher at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University. It might also be difficult to tease out the impact of climate change policies on energy prices. Global prices are spiking primarily because demand is outpacing supply. But that’s a global phenomenon, not driven by U.S. policy. And concern about climate change may be a contributing factor: Investors are wary of sinking millions into new natural-gas production capacity at a time when the global appetite appears to be shifting toward renewable sources. Palmer said, ""As a result of the massive decline in natural gas prices, we’re saving 11,000 lives per year in the U.S.""  That claim fairly represents a study’s findings. But the study looked narrowly at wintertime mortality related to prices, without taking into account other implications of increased natural gas use, such as air pollution. Public health researchers warned that variation in seasonal flu and other factors make it difficult to draw clear links between cold and mortality. Meanwhile, other research finds that warmer temperatures due to climate change cause 12,000 premature deaths a year. Palmer’s claim is partly accurate, but takes a narrow view of the implications of Biden’s policies for combating climate change and leaves out important context about research on the connection between temperatures and mortality",Half True,"September 23, 2021"

The image was shared in a Facebook post that was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post uses a sarcastic tone to mock what scientists say about climate change and hurricanes, but it mischaracterizes what is the consensus view among hurricane researchers. Their message is not that climate change caused recent hurricanes, but that there is evidence that it might have made them more serious. The post also misstates the number of hurricanes. Brian McNoldy, senior research associate at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, said there have been 140 hurricanes in Florida since 1850. The Sept. 8 post was shared by conservative commentator James T. Harris, who has more than 537,000 followers on Facebook. But neither his post nor the viral image cites a particular hurricane. The post came one day after President Joe Biden walked through a New York City neighborhood devastated by the remnants of Hurricane Ida, where he said, ""the evidence is clear. Climate change poses an existential threat to our lives.""  But the text in the image has circulated since at least September 2017, when Hurricane Irma hit Florida, and some versions of the post insert the word ""manmade"" before ""climate change."" Here’s what we found in a fact-check published Sept. 9,  and one from October 2020: Studies of Atlantic storms since 1980 found that the hurricanes that form there tend to be stronger than in the past. Human-driven climate change might play a role, although the science is unsettled. The number of hurricanes making landfall in the U.S. each year has not increased since a century ago, but researchers said it’s likely that global warming will cause future hurricanes to be more intense. We asked several hurricane researchers about the claim in the viral image; they agreed that climate change doesn’t cause hurricanes, but could make them more severe. ""The way we think about climate change impact on extremes, including hurricanes"" is that climate change from human activity ""can modify their characteristics,"" said Suzana Camargo, a research professor at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University. For example, the most intense hurricanes occur more often, or the precipitation associated with particular hurricanes increases, she said. As for climate change’s effect specifically on Florida hurricanes, ""it is hard to make the assessment on a specific region, as the sample size is small,"" she said. Climate change is not the cause of hurricanes, because hurricanes occur naturally, said Kevin Trenberth, distinguished scholar at the National Center of Atmospheric Research. ""But climate change alters the ocean and atmosphere environment to make them more active. This can and is manifested in several ways: more intensity, bigger, longer lasting, and perhaps more hurricanes."" Phil Klotzbach, research scientist in the Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University, said ""we don't expect to see more hurricanes in the future due to climate change — in fact we actually see fewer — but the warmer water temperatures may lead to stronger storms in the future."" He added: ""These trends may be hard to detect for many years to come, especially for landfalling hurricanes."" A viral image claimed: ""Florida has had 119 hurricanes since 1850, but the last one was due to climate change."" The post uses a sarcastic tone to mock what scientists say about climate change and hurricanes, but it mischaracterizes their view.

“The frequency of hurricanes making landfall in the continental U.S. has declined slightly since 1900...There aren’t more powerful hurricanes either.”,"After President Joe Biden walked through a neighborhood devastated by the remnants of Hurricane Ida in Queens in New York City, he said the evidence is now clear that climate change ""poses an existential threat to our lives.""  ""We’ve got to listen to the scientists and the economists and the national security experts,"" Biden said Sept. 7. ""They’ve been warning us the extreme weather would get more extreme over the decade, and we’re living it in real time now."" A Wall Street Journal columnist wrote that when it comes to hurricanes, too much is made of the climate change effect.  ""Atlantic hurricanes are not becoming more frequent,"" columnist Bjorn Lomborg wrote Sept. 3. ""In fact, the frequency of hurricanes making landfall in the continental U.S. has declined slightly since 1900."" Lomborg continued. ""There aren’t more powerful hurricanes either. The frequency of Category 3 and above hurricanes making landfall since 1900 is also trending slightly down,"" he wrote. Lomborg is a Danish political scientist and president of Copenhagen Consensus Center, a Danish think tank. He has long questioned conventional wisdom on climate change, and his column said improving infrastructure would do more to save lives and property than cutting carbon emissions. The idea that the U.S. is seeing fewer hurricanes, and fewer powerful ones as well, runs counter to the thrust of many news articles. It's fair to say that hurricanes sit in one of the knottier corners of climate change where the trends and underlying forces are tough to untangle. But Lomborg overstates the data. Lomborg cites a 2018 article in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society that had a chart showing a slight decline in the yearly number of hurricanes that hit the U.S. Chart of hurricanes making landfall in the U.S. since 1900 (© American Meteorological Society. Used with permission.) Hurricane activity swings up and down, and the authors use a statistical device to create an overall trend line — the dotted line in the chart. ""I simply show the data of what actually has happened, as documented in the best, peer-reviewed papers, to contrast what many believe from listening to a media filled with hurricane reporting,"" Lomborg told us. Lomborg’s data, though, is more ambiguous than first appears. The study’s authors note that their dotted line is not statistically significant.  One of the authors, Roger Pielke Jr., a political scientist in the University of Colorado’s environmental studies program, affirmed Lomborg’s claim about a slight decline. But he also said the latest U.N. report found ""no trend in the frequency of U.S. landfall events."" A finding of ""no trend"" is not the same as finding a downward trend. The decrease was not meaningful, said Christopher Landsea, National Hurricane Center’s chief of Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch. Researchers in this field emphasize that looking back to 1900, there is no discernable trend, up or down. ""The main takeaway is that there's been no increase in U.S. hurricane numbers,"" Landsea said. Lomborg relies on the same Meteorological Society article to say that the frequency of strong hurricanes — those rated Category 3 or higher — is trending slightly down. But again, the authors of that article said the trend wasn’t statistically significant. With his focus on the havoc wreaked by hurricanes, Lomborg looked only at storms that made landfall in the U.S. But that approach omits a lot of storms from the study of climate change and tropical cyclones. ""One has to remember that only about 12% of all hurricanes occur in the Atlantic and only about a third of those make landfall in the U.S., so he is talking about roughly 4% of all hurricanes,"" said Kerry Emanuel, professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The interplay of all the forces that produce hurricanes are complicated. There are a host of data problems in the historic record, which Lombard acknowledged. The further back you go, the greater the chance that some hurricanes went uncounted, even the ones that hit land. There’s a long-term naturally occurring fluctuation in the waters of the Atlantic that might affect the number of hurricanes — although researchers vigorously debate its role.  Many, though not all, researchers believe that from 1960 to 1980, aerosol pollutants likely counteracted global warming by reducing the sunlight that warmed the ocean. This would mask the impact of greenhouse gases on hurricane trends. When clean air legislation removed those pollutants, greenhouse warming came to the fore. The U.N.’s International Panel on Climate Change wrote in its latest report that there has been an ""observed increase in Atlantic hurricane activity since the 1970s."" The report also said that there’s no consensus on what lies behind that. Lomborg dismissed the idea that hurricane patterns have changed in the course of a century. But researchers looking at more recent periods, and more than just storms that hit the U.S., have the advantage of much more complete data than is available in the historic record.  A 2019 paper concluded that human-driven climate change likely made Atlantic hurricanes stronger. The authors analyzed changes in wind speed for storms between 1982 and 2009 and found ""significant increases in tropical cyclone intensification rates in the Atlantic basin that are highly unusual.""  They said naturally occurring factors didn’t fully explain the shift. To add to the complexity, climate change pushes hurricane trends both up and down. Greenhouse gases have raised ocean temperatures. By itself, that would lead to more hurricanes. But James Kossin, a senior scientist with the analytics group The Climate Service and a researcher at the University of Wisconsin notes that the same greenhouse gas warming tends to stabilize the atmosphere. ""It suppresses the tropical thunderstorms that would ultimately strengthen to form tropical depressions and then tropical storms and hurricanes,"" Kossin said. ""They can't get off the ground, so to speak."" Many models predict climate change will bring fewer hurricanes, which leads Kossin to minimize the importance of Lomborg’s argument. ""Concentrating on the continental U.S. landfall frequency record has become a bit of a cottage industry for anyone who wants to claim that hurricanes are not linked to climate change,"" Kossin said. ""We're not sure that there will be more storms that form, and there may even be fewer that form, but when they do form, they are more likely to be very dangerous: stronger winds, higher storm surge, more rain and freshwater flooding, slower moving and more likely to stall."" Lomborg said that the frequency and strength of hurricanes hitting the U.S. had declined slightly since 1900. The small shift in some of Lomborg’s sources doesn’t amount to a statistically significant change over the past 120 years. Researchers broadly agree that given all the problems with the historic data, there is no discernable trend either way. Studies of Atlantic storms since 1980, using more robust data, find that the hurricanes that form there tend to be stronger than in the past. Human-driven climate change might play a role, although the science is unsettled. Lomborg focused on a limited number of hurricanes and pushed the data beyond what the research supports",Half True,"September 9, 2021"
"Says the 1995 Chicago heat wave was “the largest single-day, non-war fatality in the United States” prior to 9/11, and “we are now expecting temperatures that hot in Chicago every summer.”","A group of House Democrats and environmental group leaders held a news conference touting President Joe Biden’s infrastructure spending priorities, which include efforts to curb climate change. Among them was U.S. Rep. Sean Casten, a former clean-energy entrepreneur who represents Illinois’ west suburban 6th Congressional District. To make his point, the second-term congressman gave a local example to emphasize the cost of a rapidly warming world. ""Chicago had a heat wave in 1995 that killed 739 people,"" Casten said Aug. 23. ""Prior to 9/11 that was the largest single-day, non-war fatality in the United States. We are now expecting temperatures that hot in Chicago every summer."" The #IPCCReport makes it clear this is our last chance to take the #ClimateAction science demands.I joined @USRepKCastor, @RepDebDingell, & @RepHorsford for a press conference hosted by @LCVoters, @actonclimateUS & @BGAlliance because have to act. Now. pic.twitter.com/Ep7QDHJkv9 The heat wave that struck Chicago that July more than 25 years ago was labeled the deadliest weather event in the city’s history. But it did not take those lives in a single day, making it impossible to compare the tragedy to more sudden disasters. Casten is on firmer ground when it comes to predictions about forecasts for more frequent extreme heat in Chicago, though he left out some important context there, too. The lethal heat wave that July lasted three days and killed 739, according to one estimate from researchers, who also found elderly and Black Chicagoans were disproportionately affected. While the event is considered among the nation’s deadliest climate disasters, it was not the deadliest domestic tragedy prior to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, nor the most fatal event in Chicago history. In 1915, for instance, a passenger boat called the SS Eastland capsized while tied to a dock in the Chicago River, killing 844. Casten specified ""single-day"" fatalities, so we wondered why he chose to compare an estimated death toll for a heat wave that spanned multiple days to the number of fatalities from more sudden disasters like the SS Eastland sinking. In response to our question, Casten spokesperson Emilia Rowland acknowledged the mistake. ""I believe my boss misspoke,"" she wrote in an email. As backup for the second part of Casten’s claim, Rowland sent us a 2010 research brief from the University of Illinois that explored what the Midwest’s climate may look like by mid-century. During the deadly 1995 Chicago heat wave, the two-page publication notes, ""temperatures soared as high as 106 degrees during the day and stayed above 80 degrees on many of the hottest nights. Such heat waves will be more commonplace in 2050. Under lower emissions scenarios, they could occur once per decade. Under higher emissions scenarios, they could happen once a year."" Those predictions were based on previous work from the climate scientists who authored the brief, Donald Wuebbles of the University of Illinois and Katharine Hayhoe of Texas Tech University. The future looks even more grim by the end of the century, when their research predicts Chicago could see 1995-like heat waves every other year even if emissions are lowered and up to three times per year if emissions are not significantly reduced soon. More recent reports have also forecast unprecedented temperature increases in northern Illinois by the end of the century in line with those earlier findings, Wuebbles told us. But the research doesn’t fully back up Casten’s claim that Chicago is ""now expecting"" temperatures as hot as the 1995 heat wave every summer. ""We are expecting temperatures as hot as the 1995 heat wave in Chicago to recur more frequently as a result of climate change: that is absolutely true,"" Hayhoe said. ""The question is, ‘how often?’ — and that depends both on the time frame we’re talking about, and even more critically on our emission choices."" Casten said the 1995 Chicago heat wave that killed 739 people was ""the largest single-day, non-war fatality in the United States"" prior to 9/11 and ""we are now expecting temperatures that hot in Chicago every summer."" That heat wave spanned multiple days, making it impossible to compare the event to more sudden tragedies, many of which also killed more people. Casten’s office told us the congressman was mistaken in this comparison. Casten is correct that Chicago faces a future of increasingly frequent extreme heat. If significant actions are not taken to reduce emissions, the city could face 1995-like heat waves every year. But Chicago might still avoid this fate with lower emissions, researchers said, and even in the worst case such extreme heat events would not become so frequent until at least 2050",Mostly False,"September 1, 2021"
“It would cost $20 billion to end homelessness in the U.S.” and “halting global warming would cost $300 billion.”,"Some people on social media questioned why the world’s richest people aren’t sharing some of their wealth to help solve pressing global problems.  One Facebook post singled out climate change and homelessness, saying billionaires such as former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg could do more to end both. ""It would cost $20 billion to end homelessness in the U.S. Mike Bloomberg could do that tomorrow and still have $28 billion to his name,"" the post said. ""Halting global warming would cost $300 billion. The world’s 10 richest people could each throw in $30 billion and still have $386 billion themselves.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) For this fact-check, we wanted to look into the post’s claims about the cost of ending homelessness and halting global warming.  There’s no single number experts agree on that can capture the cost of ending homelessness or climate change. Both issues are complex. But our reporting found that the $20 billion to end homelessness and $300 billion to halt global warming would be far from sufficient.  The $20 billion figure to end homelessness has circulated for years. That number traces back to reporting about an outdated estimate from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in 2012. It  was a rough estimate of the annual cost. The number has to do with housing choice vouchers, which are the primary component of federal spending on housing assistance. They are seen by advocates as one of the primary ways the government can address the homelessness crisis.  Under the housing choice voucher program, renters contribute 30% of their monthly income in rent and the federal government pays the rest, said Jason Ward, an economist and associate director for the RAND Center for Housing and Homelessness in Los Angeles. Not everyone who is eligible for housing assistance receives it. Ward estimated that around 7.4 million eligible households are not receiving this aid. Expanding the voucher program to cover all those who are eligible would cost well over $20 billion. The average subsidy per voucher holder is around $8,000 a year. Multiply that by 7.4 million, and it would cost at least $59 billion per year to fully fund the voucher program. The government would still need to substantially increase the supply of affordable housing so that the use of vouchers would not reduce the housing supply and raise rents.  Current estimates of the costs of building affordable housing in major metropolitan areas range from around $150,000 per unit in Atlanta to a high of $550,000 per unit in Southern California. Constructing more than 3.5 million new units — Ward’s estimate for the affordable housing units needed to fill the voucher shortfall — could cost $1.3 trillion, Ward said.  ""These estimates still also ignore the costs of providing the significant service needs of many individuals currently experiencing chronic homelessness, which include intensive mental health services and health care treatment/management for a variety of chronic health conditions, as well as substance abuse treatment for the large portion of the chronically homeless population struggling with addiction,"" Ward said. The claim that $300 billion can halt global warming appears to be rooted in a 2019 Bloomberg column. The piece says that $300 billion is enough to lock millions of tons of carbon emissions back into the soil.  That article’s authors cite René Castro Salazar, an assistant director general at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Salazar told Bloomberg that almost 5 billion acres of degraded land could be restored to pasture, in effect reversing desertification trends and converting enough carbon into biomass to stabilize carbon emissions for 15 to 20 years — giving the world a chance to adopt longer-term sustainable technologies.  Capturing carbon by restoring lands that have been degraded by misuse, deforestation or overgrazing is one of the strategies scientists have identified to mitigate environmental distress and disaster.  The Bloomberg column focused on this one strategy. A 2019 Slate column pointed out that while a hypothetical soil restoration strategy might be technically sound, addressing climate change comes with major political roadblocks, making actual costs much higher.  Experts themselves disagree on how much it would cost the world to halt the catastrophic consequences of global warming — but $300 billion falls well short of most estimates.  Yvo de Boer, the former executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, estimated that reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change would require $300 billion a year from 2020 onward. A major report from the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius would require an annual average investment of around $2.4 trillion from 2016 to 2035, or around $48 trillion.  In a 2020 review, climate research group Project Drawdown estimated that deploying the technologies and changes necessary to meet the climate targets set by the Paris Agreement would cost the world about $25 trillion.  A paper published in the scientific journal Nature posited a model to estimate the cumulative costs of achieving climate policy targets. Estimates ranged from $10 trillion to $100 trillion, with median estimates falling between $15 trillion and $30 trillion. A report by the Paris-based International Energy Agency in 2020 suggested that reaching global net zero emissions by 2050 would cost $5 trillion in clean energy investments.  The wide range of cost estimates puzzles lawmakers and researchers, said a group of MIT scientists working on the issue. For one thing, it’s hard to accurately gauge the price of various technologies that have not yet been fully developed. Models for estimating cost often do not account for possible public resistance, limited resources and lack of international cooperation.  A Facebook post claimed that it would cost $20 billion to end homelessness in the U.S. and $300 billion to halt global warming.  These issues are complex, and there are no firm estimates of the cost of addressing them. That said, expert analysis suggests that $20 billion falls short of the actual cost to end homelessness in the U.S. Similarly, while cost models for meeting climate change targets differ widely, $300 billion is much lower — sometimes by a hundredfold— than other estimates posited by experts",Mostly False,"August 27, 2021"
Says “Jeff Bezos will put 300 (metric tons) of carbon into the atmosphere for 180 seconds in space.”,"When uber-billionaire Jeff Bezos blasted off from a launchpad in Texas for a fast and short trip to near-space, he ignited a burst of claims about the outsized carbon footprint of his adventure. ""Today Jeff Bezos will put 300 tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere for 180 seconds in space,"" said one tweet July 20. Other social posts made the same general point. ""If you are reporting on the Bezos space flight … please mention the carbon emissions."" ""They really should given Bezos trip today = more carbon pollution than avg person’s whole life but oddly most in media refuse to punch up when it comes to climate."" In terms Americans might more clearly understand, the claim is that about 330 tons of carbon dioxide were emitted for Bezos and three companions to ride to a point about 60 miles above the Earth before coming back down. The round trip lasted about 10 minutes, of which about three were spent in weightlessness. Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is one of a handful of private rocketeers aiming to turn space travel into a viable business. His company is called Blue Origin. Given the clouds of dust and fiery plume that come with any launch, it might seem likely that greenhouse gases would be part of the picture. In the case of the engine used in the Blue Origin rocket, that assumption is wrong. Conventional rocket fuels are carbon-based. The BE-3 engine developed by Bezos’ company burns liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.  ""Carbon dioxide isn’t emitted from the Blue Origin rocket that was used for today’s launch,"" said Eloise Marais, an air pollution researcher at University College London. The Guardian newspaper cited Marais in an article about how the rush of billionaires to get to space could dump massive amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Marais told The Guardian that typically, rockets release 200 to 300 metric tons of carbon dioxide during launch. That didn’t apply to the Blue Origin rocket, Marais said — but the erroneous tweets shared the article in making the claim about Blue Origin anyway. At a press conference after returning from space, Bezos said the Blue Origin rocket used ""​​the most environmentally benign propellant you can choose."" Other private companies — SpaceX, controlled by billionaire Elon Musk, and Virgin Galactic, which took owner Richard Branson into space a week before Bezos — use conventional fuels, and do release carbon dioxide. The Blue Origin flight isn’t a net zero for the environment, however. Marais and other researchers warn that every rocket poses a threat to the ozone layer. Whether it’s water vapor and nitrogen oxides from a Blue Origin engine, or particles from conventional rocket fuels, both degrade the ozone.  We should note that it takes a lot of energy to make most of the hydrogen used today. Those carbon emissions wouldn't come from the launch itself, but they are the reason there's a big push to expand ""green"" hydrogen production. ""In the stratosphere, nitrogen oxides and chemicals formed from the breakdown of water vapour convert ozone into oxygen, depleting the ozone layer which guards life on Earth against harmful UV radiation,"" Marais wrote in The Conversation July 19. Social media users tweeted that Bezos’ brief trip to space released 300 metric tons of carbon dioxide.  The trip released none. The rocket’s engine burns hydrogen and oxygen to carry it away from Earth. That doesn’t make these rides risk-free. They do pose a threat to the ozone layer",False,"July 20, 2021"

Carbon dioxide “is not a problem. The Earth has more than enough land and ocean plant life to metabolize it.”,"With record-high temperatures in the Pacific Northwest and West and heavy rains and flooding in the Midwest and Northeast, the impact of climate change has been making headlines. But skepticism is rampant on social media. Carbon dioxide ""is not a problem,"" reads one post widely shared on Facebook.

It always has been.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The statement is ""flat-out wrong,"" said Ralph Keeling, director of the carbon dioxide monitoring program at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego. Because of human activities, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have reached record highs. In May 2020, the average was just over 417 parts per million, which was the highest monthly average value ever recorded.  ""The fact that CO2 has built up at all tells us that plants and the oceans can't absorb our fossil-fuel waste fast enough,"" Keeling said.   Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, which means it traps heat in the atmosphere. It occurs naturally and also is produced by human activities such as burning fossil fuels like coal, natural gas and oil. It is ""the primary greenhouse gas emitted through human activities,"" according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere remained constant for more than 10,000 years before the Industrial Revolution, according to Scripps. Since 1958, though, carbon dioxide increases in the atmosphere have closely tracked with increases in burning of fossil fuels.  When fossil fuels are burned, about 50% of the carbon dioxide that’s released remains in the atmosphere; 25% is absorbed by land, plants and trees; and 25% is absorbed by oceans.  Oceans have been absorbing increased amounts of CO2, but not without repercussions. The acidity of surface ocean waters has increased by 30% since the Industrial Revolution began more than 200 years ago. The change can affect sea life, including creatures like oysters and corals that need certain chemical conditions to grow tough shells and skeletons. Some studies have also indicated that land ecosystems might be becoming less efficient at absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, in part because global warming makes land drier and deprives it of nutrients.  ""CO2 is a problem because it's building up and it impacts climate,"" Keeling said. ""This is already the case even though ecosystems are absorbing some of the carbon. If ecosystems stop absorbing, this makes the problem worse.""  A Facebook post says carbon dioxide ""is not a problem. The Earth has more than enough land and ocean plant life to metabolize it.""  The claim is not supported by evidence.

“California literally just told everyone to not charge their electric cars due to power shortage.”,"As Californians grapple with the increasing impacts of climate change, few things have come to be dreaded more than summer heat waves. This year, the scorching temperatures arrived early, prompting the first power conservation advisory of the summer on June 17 and setting off speculation on social media about how the heat could impact electric car owners. ""California literally just told everyone to not charge their electric cars due to power shortage,"" read a June 18 post on Facebook, which was shared more than 46,000 times.  ""So California just asked everyone to stop charging electric cars due to power outages … can’t make this crap up,"" read another, posted on June 21. There’s good news for electric car owners — the rumors are missing a lot of context and aren’t entirely true. But the posts spread quickly online and migrated from Facebook to other platforms, including Twitter. They also sparked discussion about whether California has the resources to continue to move toward electric vehicles in pursuit of a greener future. ""California can't provide enough electricity for the homes and businesses they have yet they're mandating everyone drive more electric cars,"" read one post on Facebook. ""I'm continually amazed at how stupid leftists can be."" Facebook flagged the posts as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed, so we decided to investigate. (Read more about PolitiFact California’s partnership with Facebook.)  The Alert The California Independent System Operator, or CAISO, is the nonprofit tasked with operating and managing most of California’s power grid. It regularly issues power conservation advisories when the grid is facing challenging conditions, such as intense heat or wildfires.  The advisories, known as Flex Alerts, encourage Californians to shift their energy usage to certain times of the day when the power grid is less stressed. ""A flex alert is not a power outage,"" said Gil Tal, director of the Plug-in Hybrid & Electric Vehicle Research Center of the Institute of Transportation Studies at UC Davis. ""It's a way to prevent outages. We don't like that we are being told not to use electricity, but it's a much better situation than sitting in the dark if the grid is collapsing."" Usually, the alerts ask that residents conserve power during evening hours, when people are still awake and using electricity but some energy sources, such as solar power, are not available. ""On a good day, solar in California can make up half of the generation,"" said Severin Borenstein, a professor of business administration and public policy at UC Berkeley and the director of the Energy Institute at the university's Haas School of Business. ""And so when we start to lose it, we need to have other things. One of the problems that comes up on super hot days when the demand is very high is we may not have enough of the other resources to keep the balance in the system."" In announcing the June 17 Flex Alert, CAISO encouraged people to voluntarily cut back their power usage from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. The announcement included tips on how Californians could conserve energy and advised residents to complete tasks involving high amounts of energy, such as using large appliances and charging electric vehicles, before the alert to ""be as comfortable as possible"" during the evening hours. The advisory never explicitly told Californians to not charge electric vehicles – just to shift their charging schedules, if possible, to accommodate limited resources in the evening. ""This is completely voluntary,"" Borenstein said. ""There typically aren't even financial incentives. It's just a plea and that applies to electric vehicles as well."" How electric cars get charged Today, there are just under 630,000 electric cars on the road in the Golden State, according to the California Energy Commission. Although they come in many shapes, sizes and models, all of them work similarly — drive, park and plug in as needed. How long and how often electric cars need to charge depends on a variety of factors, including how far the car has traveled, what the car’s top range is and what type of outlet it is hooked up to. Borenstein said charging a vehicle fully can take hours. ""If you're plugging into a regular old household 110-[volt] outlet, it can take all night just to replenish a battery that's been driven 100 miles during the day,"" he said. ""Most houses that have charging have at least a 220-[volt] outlet and charge about twice as fast."" But most daily commutes won’t completely drain an electric car’s battery. Data from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration shows that residents of the San Francisco Bay Area traveled an average of about 20.7 miles per day in 2019. In Los Angeles, that number was 22.5 miles each day and in Sacramento, it was 22.3 miles.  So most modern electric cars don’t need to be charged on a daily basis, Tal said.  Many get plugged in every couple of days and are equipped with timers so that owners can schedule their charges. While electric car drivers might initially balk at power outages and conservation advisories, Tal said these events usually pose ""no problem."" ""A Flex Alert is a couple of hours and there are very, very few electric car drivers that have to charge their cars in these specific few hours,"" Tal said. ""Most of the drivers today and in the future will be able to delay it by a couple of hours or a couple of days if needed."" Does California Have The Power To Go Green? As of 2019, renewable sources produced just over 30% of California’s power. In 2015, the state pledged to increase that number to 50% by 2030 and Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order last year that requires all new cars sold in California to be zero-emission vehicles by 2035. ""California is really on the cutting edge of integrating wind and solar into generation,"" Borenstein said. ""California also has much larger penetration of electric vehicles than any other state, and so we are on the cutting edge there, too. That gives us the opportunity to be a leader in coordinating the electric vehicles with the intermittent renewables."" If everyone drove an electric vehicle, Tal said Californians would ""double"" their electric use in their homes. But change is unlikely to come quickly, and the current grid is able to support short-term increases in electric cars. ""We can have millions of electric cars on today's grid with no problem,"" Tal said. ""We have less than a million today and we can go to three, four, five million without doing any serious upgrades."" In the long run, California’s power grid will need to produce and store more electricity to reliably make the shift to an entirely electrified fleet. But Tal said the process should be smooth if the changes happen ""together.""  Borenstein said it’s not the first time the power grid has needed to adjust to emerging technology, comparing the shift toward electric cars to when air conditioning became popular in the 1950s. Over the years, the grid successfully scaled up capacity to accommodate energy demands. Air conditioning units tend to kick in at roughly the same times because outside temperatures increase during the day and decrease overnight, which posed an additional challenge for the electric grid of the 1950s. Borenstein said electric cars will likely have an easier adjustment. ""We are going to have to build up capacity here as well,"" Borenstein said. ""But we probably aren't going to have to build up capacity nearly as much because everybody doesn't have to charge at the same time."" As California transitions to electric vehicles and renewable power sources, Borenstein said market forces will likely promote charging during times when energy is more plentiful. ""I think that's where we're going,"" he said. ""We're not going to make it illegal to charge your car at any particular time, but it's going to be cheaper to charge it when the grid actually is more plentiful with electricity and more expensive when the grid is tight."" Our ruling Posts on social media claimed that California told electric car owners to ""not charge"" their vehicles because of a power shortage. The posts appear to refer to a Flex Alert that was issued by the California Independent System Operator on June 17. The alert encouraged Californians to voluntarily conserve energy and charge their electric vehicles before 5 p.m. to minimize possible stress on the power grid during the first major heat wave of the summer.  CAISO officials never said people could not charge their vehicles. Rather, they asked that electric vehicle owners shift their charging schedule to accommodate limited energy sources in the evening. Furthermore, experts say that most electric vehicles only need a few hours of charging each night and are equipped with timers so that owners can schedule charging periods, making it simple for Californians to voluntarily comply with the Flex Alert. The posts also kicked off debate about whether California’s grid will be able to accommodate efforts to move toward electric vehicles in the coming years. But experts said the transition should be smooth as long as the shift to electric cars is coordinated with efforts to push for renewable energy sources and improve grid capacity. The posts entirely misinterpreted the Flex Alert and stoked largely unfounded fears about California’s move toward green energy",False,"July 2, 2021"
"Says Greta Thunberg said, ""the climate crisis doesn’t exist.""","With a little video manipulation, you can make someone appear to say something they never meant. That’s what the Instagram user Republican Party News did with a clip of teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg.

A June 21 Instagram post from Republican Party News (which is not the official GOP party account) wrote this caption for its cut of the video: ""Greta says climate change doesn’t exist."" The video quickly garnered nearly 165,000 views. In it, Hasan asks Thunberg what she would tell President Joe Biden to do. ""I would just tell him to tell the situation as it is,"" Thunberg says in the clip. ""Since the climate crisis doesn’t exist, how can we expect people to want climate action?"" A careful viewer would notice Thunberg’s image jump ever so slightly between the two sentences. Because that’s where one of two edits occurred. What Thunberg actually emphasized was the need for leaders to tell voters that the climate crisis is an existential threat. Here is the transcript of Thunberg’s complete answer. Marked in bold are the sentences that the Instagram post cut out. Hasan: ""Is there a specific policy goal if he rang you up and said Greta, what should I do? I can wave a presidential magic wand, what should I do that I’m not? What would you say?""  Thunberg: ""Nothing because that's not democratic. I mean, an elected leader cannot do anything without support from voters. And I would not want anyone to do anything that would not have the support, because that would be undemocratic and democracy is the most precious thing that we have and we must not risk that. ""So, what we need now is to raise awareness. To create public opinion. To treat the crisis like a crisis. Because if people are not aware of the crisis that we face, of course, they won’t put pressure on the elected leaders. So, I would just tell him to tell the situation as it is. Because I mean, yes, you could say, I meet with a lot of world leaders and they say ‘I can't do anything because I don't have the support from voters.’ Well, how can you expect support and pressure from voters if you aren’t treating the crisis like a crisis — since the climate crisis doesn’t exist, how can we expect people to want climate action?"" You can compare the videos for yourself. Here’s the manipulated video: Here’s the actual video: An Instagram user edited an interview to make it seem that Thunberg said that ""the climate crisis doesn’t exist."" In reality, Thunberg emphasized the need for leaders to tell voters that climate change is a real crisis. She explained why people would not press for change if they thought climate change didn’t exist. That’s the complete opposite of what the post claimed",False Pants on Fire,"June 22, 2021"
The Biden administration “ignores the negative environmental impact created by lithium mining.”,"If President Joe Biden is going to achieve his vision of putting millions more electric cars and trucks on America’s highways, lithium ion batteries will be a key piece of the effort. So far, these relatively lightweight energy cells are the best bet for going electric and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In a recent op-ed that skewered Biden’s budget plan as bloated and wasteful, Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley highlighted one of the challenges to getting enough lithium to make that shift to electric vehicles happen.  ""The president’s budget showers hundreds of billions of dollars into federal incentives for U.S. consumers to jump on the EV bandwagon, electrify school buses and install EV chargers across the country,"" Grassley wrote June 7.  But, Grassley continued, the Biden administration ""ignores the negative environmental impact created by lithium mining needed for EV batteries and power storage."" Biden and his Democratic Party offer themselves as environmental defenders. It would be a big deal if they sacrificed local environmental safety in the quest to meet national or global climate change goals. Most lithium mining comes with an environmental cost, and a major new Nevada project has drawn lawsuits from environmental groups. But Grassley’s claim goes too far in saying the administration is ignoring the problems lithium extraction poses in its push for electric vehicles. His staff explained that he was speaking only about Biden’s budget plan, not the administration’s policy across the board. That falls wide of the mark, too. Lithium-ion batteries are used for most plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and all-electric vehicles. Smaller versions also power our cell phones and laptops. Today, most lithium comes from Australia or South America. With demand projected to skyrocket, the U.S. has put a premium on producing more lithium at home. The Thacker Pass mine in northern Nevada has become the country’s first large expansion of lithium production in a decade.  Grassley’s staff pointed us to news stories about the Thacker Pass mine, a 1,000 acre open-pit mine, expected to produce 60,000 metric tons per year of battery-grade lithium carbonate. The Bureau of Land Management gave final approval to the mine on Jan. 15, 2021, in the final week of the Trump administration. The move drew a quick reaction from those who saw the mine as a threat. A local rancher sued to reverse the permit, as did several land conservation groups.  They argued that the owner, Lithium Americas, downplayed the millions of gallons of water it would use, and the pressure that would place on limited water supplies. They noted that the government’s own assessment showed that operations would raise the level of antimony, a toxic metal, in the groundwater, high enough to exceed state minimums. There would also be habitat loss. We asked the Bureau of Land Management if it was taking another look at the permit, and the agency said it had no comment. The government has assigned a Justice Department lawyer to defend against the lawsuits. It’s fair to say that, as Grassley complained, the Biden administration is now overseeing a project that could hurt the environment. But the administration’s policy goes beyond that one mine. The Bureau of Land Management is currently vetting another lithium mining project in Nevada, more to the south along the border with California. The Clayton Valley lithium pilot plant has an initial environmental assessment that considers the potential impacts on water, air, habitat and cultural resources. The government has not yet signed off on the permit. Based solely on where the process sits today, the administration is not ignoring the negative effects of lithium mining. The administration has also shown interest in finding alternatives to traditional mining techniques to extract lithium. One small Energy Department project offers $4 million to develop ways to get lithium out of the briny waters of geothermal aquifers.  On a larger scale, the department’s budget request asks Congress for $75 million to build a lithium battery recycling system. In its blueprint for lithium batteries, the department said the goal is to ""enhance environmental sustainability, and support a U.S.-based circular materials supply chain."" Grassley said that the Biden administration ""ignores the negative environmental impact created by lithium mining.""  There’s not much to back that up. The administration now oversees a project approved by the Trump administration that has drawn lawsuits, but it is vetting another lithium mine proposal against a full menu of environmental considerations. If Grassley was speaking solely about Biden’s budget plan, the facts support him even less. The Energy Department is seeking $75 million to recycle lithium batteries as a strategy to increase supply with less environmental damage.  People might argue that the administration isn’t doing enough, but there’s no evidence that the administration is ignoring the downsides of lithium mining",False,"June 9, 2021"
"""Manufacturing the battery for one electric car produces the same amount of carbon dioxide as running a petrol car for eight years.""","Electric vehicles are touted as an environmentally friendly alternative to gasoline powered cars, but one Facebook post claims that the benefits are overblown, and the vehicles are much more harmful to the planet than people assume. A cartoon posted to Facebook on April 29, shows a car in one panel with ""diesel"" written on the side and the driver thinking ""I feel so dirty."" In another panel, a car has ""electric"" written on its side with the driver thinking ""I feel so clean."" However, the electric vehicle is shown connected to what appears to be a factory that’s blowing dark smoke into the air. Below the cartoon is a caption that claims ""manufacturing the battery for one electric car produces the same amount of CO2 as running a petrol car for eight years."" This isn’t a new line of criticism against electric vehicles. Similar Facebook posts have taken aim at the carbon dioxide produced in the manufacturing of electric cars — specifically the batteries — to make the case that zero emissions vehicles aren’t necessarily clean. Full electric vehicles require a large lithium-ion battery to store energy and power the motor that propels the car, according to Insider. The lithium-ion battery packs in an electric car are chemically similar to the ones found in cell phones and laptops. Because they require a mix of metals that need to be extracted and refined, lithium-ion batteries take more energy to produce than the common lead-acid batteries used in gasoline cars to help start the engine. How much CO2 is emitted in the production depends on where the lithium-ion battery is made — or specifically, how the electricity powering the factory is generated — according to Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist and director of climate and energy at the Breakthrough Institute, an environmental research think tank. Producing a 75 kilowatt-hour battery for a Tesla Model 3, considered on the larger end of batteries for electric vehicles, would result in the emission of 4,500 kilograms of CO2 if it was made at Tesla's battery factory in Nevada. That’s the emissions equivalent to driving a gas-powered sedan for 1.4 years, at a yearly average distance of 12,000 miles, Hausfather said. If the battery were made in Asia, manufacturing it would produce 7,500 kg of carbon dioxide, or the equivalent of driving a gasoline-powered sedan for 2.4 years — but still nowhere near the eight years claimed in the Facebook post. Hausfather said the larger emission amount in Asia can be attributed to its ""higher carbon electricity mix."" The continent relies more on coal for energy production, while Tesla’s Nevada factory uses some solar energy.  ""More than half the emissions associated with manufacturing the battery are associated with electricity use,"" Hausfather said in an email to PolitiFact. ""So, as the electricity grid decarbonizes, emissions associated with battery production will decline. The same is not true for sedan tailpipe emissions."" The Facebook post does not mention the electricity needs and CO2 impact of factories that build gasoline or diesel cars and their components.  Another thing the Facebook post omits is that the CO2 emitted in the production of the battery can be offset over a short time in an electric car by the lack of tailpipe emissions when it’s in operation.  The Union of Concerned Scientists found in a 2015 report that taking into account electricity sources for charging, an electric vehicle ends up reducing greenhouse gas emissions by about 50% compared with a similar size gas-powered car. A midsize vehicle completely negates the carbon dioxide its production emits by the time it travels 4,900 miles, according to the report. For full size cars, it takes 19,000 miles of driving. The U.S. Energy Department’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy also looked at the life cycle of electric vehicles — which includes a car’s production, use and disposal — and concluded they produce less greenhouse gases and smog than gasoline-powered vehicles. The agency also found drivers could further lower CO2 emissions by charging with power generated by a renewable energy source.  A cartoon shared on Facebook claims the carbon dioxide emitted from the production of one electric car battery is the equivalent to driving a gas-powered vehicle for eight years. The production of lithium-ion batteries for electric cars emits a significant amount of carbon dioxide, but nowhere near the level claimed in the cartoon. The emissions from battery production are equivalent to driving a gasoline car for one or two years, depending on where it’s produced, and those emissions are effectively offset over time by the lack of tailpipe emissions when the car is on the road",Mostly False,"May 11, 2021"
"With the goal to preserve 30% of the earth’s land and water by 2030, “300 million people stand to lose their land and livelihood, most of them tribal and indigenous peoples.”","As part of his plan to put the brakes on climate change, President Joe Biden set a goal of conserving 30% of America’s land and waters by 2030. For land in particular, that’s a heavy lift — only about 12% of the nation’s land is now under some form of protection. Biden’s target is part of a larger international ambition to protect a third of the world’s land and waters by 2030. On a global scale, the protected regions would do a lot of work to pull carbon from the air and store it in the soil, coral reefs, sea grasses and other carbon sinks. The effort goes under name 30 by 30, or 30x30. But some advocates for indigenous peoples see a threat in the international push to protect land. One of those groups, Survival International, calls the global 30x30 plan ""the biggest land grab in history."" Survival International sees the 30x30 initiative as driving people off the land their communities may have occupied for hundreds of years, without giving them a fair voice in the process. ""Three hundred million people stand to lose their land and livelihood, most of them tribal and indigenous peoples,"" the group said in a message posted to its website on Earth Day, April 22. The 300 million figure, almost as much as the population of the U.S., is a very large number. We dug in to see where that figure comes from, and whether it represents a reasonable estimate of the likely harm due to the 30x30 plan. Backers of the 30x30 initiative question Survival International’s reasoning. They say that the plan is designed to strengthen the rights of indigenous people to stay on their land and maintain a traditional way of life — that conservation doesn’t necessarily mean eviction. Independent experts, meanwhile, see the 300 million figure as a reasonable estimate of how many people live in or near areas that are prime for conservation. But they don’t agree that the number accurately reflects how many could lose their land in the context of 30x30. A group of 51 countries, led by Costa Rica, France and the United Kingdom, are pressing to see the 30x30 goal adopted at a major international gathering on biodiversity taking place in China in October. The group includes nations from Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania and the Americas. Protecting indigenous peoples ranks at the top of their priorities. ""Indigenous peoples and local communities are protectors of the most biodiverse sites in the world,"" the group wrote when they launched Jan. 11, 2021. ""To effectively and equitably meet this increased target, they should be engaged as partners in the design and management of these conserved areas."" Brian O’Donnell, director of Colorado-based Campaign for Nature, backs the 30x30 effort. He objects to the characterization by Survival International. ""They have redefined our policies and our intent,"" O’Donnell said. ""Our aim is to safeguard and secure more rights for indigenous people. Getting land tenure rights for indigenous people is the pathway to reach 30x30."" O’Donnell said there is no dispute that conservation efforts have displaced people and led to human rights abuses in the past. He also said the current draft of the biodiversity framework slated for a vote in October should change.  ""It’s a work in progress,"" he said. ""There are some safeguards in there now for indigenous people, but they need to be stronger."" Staff at Survival International said they derived their estimate of 300 million from a 2019 study that looked at a more ambitious goal of protecting half of the world’s land and waters from development.  A team led by a University of Cambridge researcher estimated that at that 50% level, at least 1 billion people live in areas that would fall under some form of protection. Survival International staff said that in a follow-up email to a partner group — the Rainforest Foundation UK — the Cambridge researcher said preservation of 30% of land and water would affect about 297 million people. Survival International added its own take on the study. Where the researchers warned of potential problems with that level of protection, Survival International expressed it more definitively: that the 30x30 plan ""will increase human suffering and the destruction of nature. It is a deadly distraction from what is urgently needed to secure human diversity and all biodiversity: the recognition of indigenous peoples’ rights to their land."" One clarification: Survival International said in its article that ""most"" of the 300 million people potentially affected would be indigenous or tribal people. But when pressed, the group's staff said it’s not clear that it would be a majority. They told us they should have said ""many."" There are countless examples in history of indigenous people being forced off their land in the name  of conservation. In Botswana, the government banned the San people  of the Kalahari desert from their traditional lands to boost tourism and mining. In Thailand, two national park officials were charged with the murder of an indigenous human rights defender in 2019. The government later sought to have the forest that the activist had fought over designated as a UNESCO world heritage site. In the U.S., Montana’s Glacier National Park was carved out of land used by the Blackfeet Nation. Initially, tribe members had negotiated to hold on to hunting and fishing rights. But when the park was created in 1910, they lost everything. The abuses continue today, and there’s no guarantee that they won’t happen under the 30x30 initiative. But protecting land doesn’t have to entail displacing people. It is a risk, not a certainty. And the extent of that risk depends on how the land is protected. Globally, policies in the category of conservation vary, from cutting off all human activity, to allowing traditional practices, to allowing other sustainable uses. Each nation can craft its own rules for each situation. In the U.S., the interplay of legislation, an open public process and executive decisions have produced places where many uses are allowed, and others where there are no roads and no permanent residences. Researcher Stephen Garnett at Charles Darwin University in Australia cautioned that Survival International’s 300 million estimate, when applied to 30x30, is shaky for two reasons. First, we can’t know for sure which lands would be conserved under the plan. Second, the 30x30 strategy doesn’t hinge on setting land aside in a way that would ban farming or other land uses. Garnett says Australia has approached this by designating ""Indigenous Protected Areas"" to make sure aboriginal residents can continue to live on and use the land as they always have. They make up nearly half of Australia’s conserved areas, he said. A quick look at Survival International’s own website shows the pitfalls of treating all types of conservation projects as a threat to indigenous people. One news brief focuses on a tribe in India protesting their eviction from traditional honey-gathering sites inside the Nagarhole National Park. With backing from the Wildlife Conservation Society, the land is now a refuge for tigers, and a source of tourism dollars. But another bulletin tells the story of an indigenous group in Peru that wants an international human rights commission to enforce protections for land that was supposed to be kept as a tribal reserve. The Peruvian government, the post said, had reactivated logging, oil and gas concessions in these areas. Both are examples of conservation efforts. But in the first case, conservation leads to the eviction of people. In the second, conservation is a tool to protect traditional uses of the land. Survival International campaign director Fiore Longo acknowledged in an email to PolitiFact that the terms can get confusing, and ""we have to see what a protected area means and which model is applied where."" But in the dire prediction on its website that 30x30 would put 300 million people at risk, Survival International doesn’t spell out those nuances. ""The main assumption to yield a number like that is that anyone in a future protected area would get kicked out,"" said University of Maryland ecology professor Erle Ellis. ""This is not the intention of anyone working on 30x30."" Survival International said under the 30x30 plan, ""300 million people stand to lose their land and livelihood, most of them tribal and indigenous peoples."" The 300 million figure is derived from a study on the impact of land conservation efforts, but not the 30x30 initiative specifically. While conservation efforts have led to forced evictions in the past, that’s not always the case, and the assumption that 30x30 would do so runs counter to the stated priorities of the nations pressing for the plan.  Survival International said it should have said ""many"" not ""most"" of the 300 million would be indigenous people. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression",Mostly False,"May 7, 2021"
"The Green New Deal “costs an average American household almost $700,000 through 2029.”","U.S. Rep. Ben Cline recently put an eye-popping taxpayer price tag on the Green New Deal - a bold but vague climate change-centered plan that has been roundly condemned by Republicans. ""It crushes jobs, costs an average American household almost $700,000 through 2029,"" Cline, R-Va., said of the proposal during a brief floor speech on April 22.  Think about it. The average annual household income in 2019, the latest year available, was $68,700. The average household cost of the Green New Deal, according to Cline’s statement, would be about $75,000 a year. Cline is essentially saying every penny of earnings by an average household will be swallowed by the plan. Cline, who represents Virginia’s 6th Congressional District, running from Roanoke through the Shenandoah Valley, is hardly the first Republican to make this $700,000 statement. It’s been a talking point for two years. Fortunately for taxpayers, the claim doesn’t hold up. Here’s why: Green New Deal Basics The Green New Deal is a resolution - that is, a non-binding proposal and not actual legislation. It has been introduced in the House by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. and is cosponsored by 101 Democrats. There’s a companion resolution in the Senate introduced by Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., and cosponsored by 12 Democrats. The measures have been referred to subcommittees. Ocasio-Cortez and Markey introduced almost identical Green New Deal resolutions in 2019 that met heavy Republican opposition. One was killed in the Senate and the other never came up for a vote in the House. Broadly speaking, the resolutions address ways to curb climate change and protect the environment. Their far-reaching goals include ""eliminating pollution and greenhouse gas emissions as much as technologically feasible"" and ""meeting 100% of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources.""  The Green New Deal reaches into other policy areas, as well. It calls for creation of ""millions of high-wage union jobs,"" investment in infrastructure, and ""promoting social justice and equality."" But the proposals have never laid out cost figures. And they have not received a cost estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office — the gold-standard source on pricing proposed federal programs. Source of the $700,000 figure Cline’s office told us the congressman’s $700,000 tax figure comes from a 2019 report on the Green New Deal by the American Action Forum, which describes itself as a ""center-right"" think tank. The forum is a sister organization of the American Action Network, a conservative, nonprofit advocacy organization. The report doesn’t mention the $700,000 figure or a total for the estimated per-household cost. However, it does show estimated household costs for different parts of the Green New Deal from 2020-2029. Most of the cost estimates were expressed in ranges. Cline said the Green New Deal  ""costs an average American household almost $700,000 through 2029,"" - which suggests a massive tax increase for every family. But the American Action Forum analysis doesn’t actually say that typical households will pay that cost in new taxes.  If we add up the high-end range estimate in each category, it comes to $671,010 between 2020 and 2029. If we add up the low-end figure in each category, it comes to $369,010. To come up with estimates, the American Action Forum made a series of assumptions, such as that the Green New Deal would invest so heavily in high-speed rail transit ""that air travel becomes unnecessary."" The actual text of the resolution does not call for grounding airplanes.  The American Action Forum analysis also assumed the plan would include a Medicare for All proposal similar to one made by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and estimated it would cost average households $260,000 over 10 years. However, the texts of the green resolutions don’t mention Medicare for All -- instead, they more broadly call for ""hig h quality health care"" for everyone. The American Action Forum put a number of caveats in its study that Cline and many other Republicans omit. It said, ""The breadth of its proposals makes it daunting to assess the (Green New Deal) using the standard tools of policy analysis"" and called its study an ""initial foray."" The researchers wrote that many of the goals in the plan would require policies that are ""redundant with other aspects in it, which also complicates a precise analysis, as the interactions are difficult to predict."" The report’s lead author is Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of American Action Forum and former director of the Congressional Budget Office. He has told PolitiFact he would need more details about the Green New Deal to conduct a more specific cost analysis. Our ruling Cline said the Green New Deal ""costs an average American household almost $700,000 through 2029."" The Green New Deal is a set of goals, not detailed policies attached to specific taxes. The $700,000 number comes from a brief that its author, the right-of-center American Action Forum, acknowledges is a preliminary and rough estimate. The analysis did not say an average household would pay an extra $700,000 in taxes. Instead, it estimated a range of possible costs under different scenarios over 10 years and Cline took the highest number.  It’s possible the resolution will eventually lead to specific legislation that can be formally analyzed for potential costs, but at this point, the proposals are murky",False,"May 5, 2021"
Says Joe Biden is “going to control how much meat you can eat.”,"President Joe Biden is not restricting access to red meat.

But in short, the top House Republican was up in arms over a Biden plan that doesn’t actually exist. The false claims about Biden coming after America’s hamburgers started with a Daily Mail article that wrongly linked his climate goals to an unrelated 2020 study from the University of Michigan, which examined the impact various dietary changes would have on U.S. carbon emissions. After Biden pledged to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030, the Daily Mail ran its article, which made projections as to what policies could potentially make Biden’s goal a reality. At one point, the article speculated that ""Americans may have to cut their red meat consumption by a whopping 90%,"" citing the Michigan study. But the study has no link to Biden’s plans. ""The study was published in January 2020, when Trump was still president, so it had nothing to do with Biden or his climate change plan,"" said Tulane University professor Diego Rose, one of the study’s three co-authors. ""It's all just sensational goo from ‘Fox & Friends.’"" ""The study shows that if we eat less meat, especially beef, we could substantially reduce our dietary carbon footprint. But that change in behavior is a choice that individuals will make."" In a separate statement, co-authors Martin Heller and Gregory Keoleian of the University of Michigan explained that one hypothetical scenario the study considered was a 90% reduction in beef combined with a 50% reduction in other meats. They found that such a change would reduce ""diet-related greenhouse gas emissions associated with agricultural production"" by 50%. ""But this is not a specific recommended policy for achieving a 50% reduction in U.S. carbon emissions,"" Heller and Keoleian said.  They added: ""President Biden’s climate plan does not directly refer to diet shift as a carbon reduction strategy, so the linkage to our study is baseless."" Biden’s climate plans do not include restrictions on red meat consumption, a White House official confirmed to PolitiFact. Biden never mentioned red meat when he announced his plan to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 52% below 2005 levels by 2030, a move that would double the U.S.’s commitment under the 2015 Paris climate agreement. He talked mostly about investing in U.S infrastructure by modernizing the grid and shifting toward electric vehicles, among other things.  McCarthy’s claim that Biden is ""going to control how much meat you can eat"" came days after the notion was widely debunked by fact-checkers and news outlets.  It also came after Fox News — which created a graphic about Biden limiting meat — acknowledged in an on-air correction that the ""graphic and the script incorrectly implied that it was part of Biden’s plan for dealing with climate change.

""Here’s an example of how it’s going to affect your lifestyle,"" host Brian Kilmeade said April 23. ""It’s going to cut 90% of red meat out of a diet. That’s four pounds a year."" ""Part of his climate or green targets are to cut our red meat,"" host Ainsley Earhardt repeated minutes later. ""He wants to cut out 90% of the red meat that you all eat."" Other Fox journalists followed suit, including Kudlow, Charles Payne and Jesse Watters. Watters said on ""The Five"" that to make Biden’s climate plan happen, ""Americans would have to cut red meat consumption by a whopping 90%. That means only one burger a month."" He repeated the same claim the following night on ""Watters’ World."" In the primetime hour, Fox News host Sean Hannity said April 23 that Biden’s plans ""will impact how you eat, including red meat."" On April 24, Jeanine Pirro asked, ""Do you like red meat? … Not so fast. The left with their Green New Deal wants to make sure you don’t."" The false claims were not limited to the talk show hosts, however. Fox News White House correspondent John Roberts opened his April 23 news segment on ""America Reports,"" a daytime news program, by telling viewers, ""Say goodbye to your burgers if you want to sign up for the climate agenda. That’s the finding of one study."" Later that night, anchor Shannon Bream asked her viewers, ""Could new climate impact plans limit you to just one burger a month?""  Correspondent Kevin Corke told Bream that under Biden’s plan, ""all Americans would have to limit their consumption of burgers by about one a month.""  Screenshots of Fox News and Fox Business Network graphics and chyrons about Joe Biden's climate plans. After fact-checkers and news outlets pointed out that the claims about Biden limiting meat were inaccurate, Roberts walked back the claims. ""That research from 2020 found that cutting back how much red meat people eat would have a drastic impact on harmful greenhouse gas emissions,"" Roberts said of the study.

"“Those 30-, 40-year mortgages” prove that banks know climate change “is not going to happen.”","For Earth Day 2021, an Instagram account resurfaced a video of former oil executive Dan Peña claiming global climate change is the ""greatest fraud that’s been perpetrated on mankind this century."" The video was from an event in 2017 that Peña hosted with London Real, an online platform that’s been accused in the past of sharing COVID-19 misinformation. The Instagram post includes the video with the headline ""Global warming is the biggest scam of this century"" in large, white letters.  Peña’s bio from his official website identifies him as founder and former CEO of Great Western Resources Inc. In the video, Peña claims climate change isn’t real, and the proof is that financial institutions don’t allude to it in any of their investment and lending documents. He said banks wouldn’t offer multi-decade mortgages in places like Florida knowing the sea level would rise and destroy a home.  ""Because the financial institutions, the banks of this world, know it’s not going to happen,"" Peña said. ""You know those 30-, 40-year mortgages? The world will be over by then."" Instagram is owned by Facebook, and the post was flagged as part of the company’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Scientists and governments around the world have concluded that climate change is a real threat and that halting it will require immediate mitigation steps to reduce carbon emissions.  Scientists say there is a more than 95% chance that changes to the climate stem from more than a half century of human activity, according to NASA. Industrialization and the use of fossil fuels in vehicles and power plants have released large amounts of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere more than 250 times faster than from natural sources. Changes to the Earth’s climate have resulted in warmer temperatures, a rising sea level and more extreme weather events like flooding and wildfires. Financial intuitions have also acknowledged this risk, contrary to Peña’s claim. As far back as 2016, Sean Becketti, who was the president and chief economist of federally chartered mortgage buyer Freddie Mac, warned that the potential damage that climate change and rising sea levels will have on the housing market is ""likely to be greater in total than those experienced in the housing crisis and Great Recession."" Climate change would increase the likelihood certain homes would be located in a flood-risk area, making lending more risky, he wrote, and lenders would have to weigh the financial risks and benefits of providing a 30-year mortgage to a home at risk of flooding if the chances of it happening continue to increase over time. ""In the housing crisis, a significant share of borrowers continued to make their mortgage payments even though the values of their homes were less than the balances of their mortgages,"" he wrote. ""It is less likely that borrowers will continue to make mortgage payments if their homes are literally underwater."" The New York Times has also reported local banks are starting to face the reality of providing mortgages for homes in flood-prone areas, since climate change has made severe weather events more likely. In coastal areas, some banks are requiring buyers to pay a 40% down payment for a home rather than the traditional 20%.  Local lenders have also begun offloading mortgages onto government-sponsored financial institutions like Fannie Mae to avoid losing money if a home is destroyed because of climate change, The New York Times reported.  Homes in high flood risk areas with mortgages from government-backed lenders are required to have flood insurance, according to the Federal Emergency Management Administration. To combat climate change, and protect their investments, several major banks including Citi, Wells Fargo and Bank of America have made net-zero carbon emissions pledges. Each bank has committed to making its supply chain, operations and financing activities carbon neutral by 2050.  To achieve this, the banks have said they will transition to low-carbon and renewable energy sources for their buildings and finance more environmentally sustainable projects. ""Climate change is one of the most urgent environmental and social issues of our time,"" Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said in a statement in March. ""The risks of not taking action are too great to ignore, and collective action is needed to avoid the significant impact on our most vulnerable communities."" JPMorgan Chase, which environmentalists have labeled one of the  the largest investors in fossil fuels, called climate change a ""global challenge"" that will take a collaborative effort between the private and public sectors to combat.  ""Research shows that climate impacts are occurring much sooner than anticipated and with increasing frequency,"" CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement in 2019. ""The private sector has the opportunity to play a role in creating solutions that grow the economy, thereby supporting governments in their efforts to minimize long-term impacts to the planet and enable a more sustainable future for all people."" An Instagram post shows a video of Peña in which he claims that climate change is not real, and cites as evidence the fact that lenders still offer 30-year mortgages in flood-risk areas like Florida. An overwhelming majority of the world’s scientists have concluded climate change is real and puts humans at risk. Financial institutions like Freddie Mac have also acknowledged climate change’s existence and the impact it will have on mortgage lending.

Two photos show climate change “is a hoax.”,"A few days before Earth Day 2021, a meme spread across Facebook claiming to have proof that climate change is a hoax. But a couple of water’s-edge photographs don’t prove anything, climatewise. The meme’s sarcastic headline was: ""99 years of sea level rise — Palm Beach Sydney."" Palm Beach is a town north of Sydney, Australia.  Below the headline were two photos, apparently of the same strip of land, with water on the left and the right. A black-and-white photo was labeled 1917 and a color photo was labeled 2016.  ""For years they called it Global Warming. But they were proven over and over that no such thing is happening,"" the text below the photos said. ""Then they started calling it Climate Change. Again it is a hoax."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post appears to argue that the photos indicate the water level at a particular site didn’t change in 99 years.  Tides rise and fall, of course — even during the course of a day, as well over a period of years. According to experts, photos like these don’t reveal long-term changes in sea level, and globally, sea levels are up, with climate change being the primary reason why. A Google search indicates the two photos are from Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, which is about 17 miles north of Sydney. First Draft, a nonprofit that fights misinformation, told us the black-and-white photo appears to have been taken at Palm Beach and that an Australian government website dates the image as being taken between 1917 and 1946. First Draft could not confirm details about the other photo. Facebook users who clicked on the Palm Beach meme will see it has been marked with a fact-check that Climate Feedback did in 2019. It rated as inaccurate a similar meme with two photos claiming that ""unprecedented climate change"" had caused no rise in sea level at Sydney Harbour in 140 years.  The fact-checkers found that two photos taken at different times cannot reveal whether a sea-level change has occurred, given that tides rise and fall. An expert from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California told Climate Feedback that during the 20th century, the sea level in Sydney rose by about 12 centimeters or just under 5 inches. Jet Propulsion Laboratory reported in May that global warming is adding about 750 gigatonnes of water to the ocean each year. Solely for visualization purposes, that’s enough in one year to cover Texas more than 3 feet deep. Satellite observations from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center reported in October an increase of 3.3 millimeters per year in sea level since 1993. Sea level rose more than 200 millimeters (nearly 8 inches) from 1900 to 2018, according to coastal tide gauge and satellite data. ""Sea level rise is caused primarily by two factors related to global warming: the added water from melting ice sheets and glaciers and the expansion of seawater as it warms,"" NASA said. Sea-level rise is uneven in space and time but on average, sea level is rising because of climate warming caused by humans, said Thomas Frederikse, a postdoctoral fellow at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ""The post is wrong and climate change is all too real."" A Facebook post says two water’s-edge photos, apparently from the same location, show climate change ""is a hoax.""

Says Joe Biden’s infrastructure plan “is the Green New Deal.”,"Republican opposition to President Joe Biden’s infrastructure proposal has been swift and vocal. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said that as written, the $2.3 trillion American Jobs Plan released March 31 was a nonstarter. The conservative PAC Citizens United put Biden’s plan in the same boat as the Green New Deal, a sweeping environmental and social justice agenda that Republicans have condemned. ""Does this sound like an infrastructure bill to you?"" the group tweeted March 31, with a link to a New York Times article about the proposal. ""It's not. It's the Green New Deal. "" Does this sound like an infrastructure bill to you? It's not. It's the Green New Deal. ""It is the first step in a two-part agenda to overhaul American capitalism, fight climate change and attempt to improve the productivity of the economy.""https://t.co/ajIoRCttgl The Times article described Biden’s plan as the first step in a legislative package that aimed to boost productivity, fight climate change and ""overhaul American capitalism."" During the presidential campaign, Biden said he does not support the Green New Deal. His current proposal is a blend of money for traditional brick-and-mortar infrastructure — roads, water supplies, broadband, etc. — clean energy and improved manufacturing, and social service infrastructure, meaning caregivers for seniors and the disabled. We called and emailed Citizens United to ask on what basis they equated the White House initiative with the Green New Deal. We did not hear back. There’s overlap between the two, but also considerable differences. The Green New Deal was a House resolution introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., that laid out a set of climate, economic and social goals. Ocasio-Cortez criticized the Biden plan, saying ""This is not nearly enough."" The 2019 resolution was not a line-by-line spending plan. But the Green New Deal inspired the crafting of the THRIVE Act, legislation due to be introduced in April by a group of Democrats in Congress to advance the goals of the resolution. The THRIVE Act does have a proposed budget. The Green New Deal Network, a group of advocacy groups, summarized it in a spreadsheet, and it comes out to much more than the American Jobs Plan.  Over a 10-year span, it would spend about $9.5 trillion, or about $7 trillion more than Biden’s proposal. Two of the largest differences are in the areas of clean energy and agriculture. The THRIVE Act would spend about 10 times more than the American Jobs Plan on clean energy. For agriculture, the White House has no spending line, while the THRIVE Act has $1.6 trillion to support farming that uses less fossil fuels and locks more carbon in the soil. (The recently passed stimulus law provided about $5.6 billion in aid to farmers and rural communities.) Here is our summary of how the two spending plans compare across some major categories. The American Jobs Plan also includes about $480 billion to boost manufacturing and research and development, some of which might boost clean energy. The THRIVE Act folds money for those activities into other line items, primarily its investments in clean energy. Ryan Schleeter, spokesman for Greenpeace USA, a Green New Deal Network member, said it is misleading to equate Biden’s proposal with the Green New Deal. ""The American Jobs Plan is similar in intent to the THRIVE Act, but far narrower in scope and scale,"" Schleeter said. Among the broader items on the original Green New Deal agenda were a guaranteed livable wage, affordable higher education and universal health care. The American Jobs Plan does not include those elements. Citizens United said that Biden’s infrastructure proposal is the Green New Deal. The two plans share some common approaches, but a spending plan inspired by the Green New Deal is about four times larger than the Biden plan. The Green New Deal also advocates broader social goals that are absent from the White House infrastructure proposal",Mostly False,"April 2, 2021"
"The Democratic clean energy plan is pro-China, because ""90% of the solar panels, 80% of the wind machines, 90% of the rare earth minerals … are in Asia or in China.”","A Democratic-led plan to cut carbon emissions and expand cleaner energy sources would play into the hands of China, some Republicans argue. At a hearing on the CLEAN Future Act, the Democrats’ climate bill, Rep. Cathy Rodgers, R-Wash., contended the plan could make the United States vulnerable. Rodgers, the ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce committee, said: ""90% of the solar panels, 80% of the wind machines, 90% of the rare earth minerals (for) the batteries are in Asia or in China. So a clean energy future that is based upon those kinds of solutions that are dominated by China is really a pro-China agenda."" While Rodgers singled out China, she also included all of Asia, which would include longtime allies such as Japan and South Korea. With an eye on the geopolitical angle she emphasized at the end, we looked at what the numbers say about American reliance on China for renewable energy materials. China’s current dominance in key materials is real. Whether that means a clean-energy policy amounts to a pro-China agenda is another question. We’ll go through the three renewable power systems Rodgers listed and weigh whether the data support her broader concern. Rodgers is right that most solar panels come from Asia. The solar supply base extends beyond China, but it does have a critical reliance on Chinese materials and companies. Rodgers’ staff pointed to a report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank, that said ""the United States is most exposed in the solar sector, followed by energy storage and then wind."" The study detailed China’s key role in producing the parts that go into solar panels. A silicon wafer is the building block of a solar panel. It’s the piece that turns sunshine into electricity, and ""more than 90% of the world’s capacity is in China,"" the February report said. The wafers are used to make solar cells and clusters of cells are assembled into solar panels, sometimes called photovoltaic modules. And here’s where the solar supply chain takes a geographic hop. In 2019, the latest year for which the U.S. Energy Information Administration has data, China — even grouped with Singapore by the EIA —  accounted for less than 6% of the solar panels imported to the U.S., as measured by their generation capacity. Malaysia was the single largest supplier, representing about 38% of all shipments. Vietnam came in second with 25%.   Does that mean the U.S. relies more on Malaysia than China? Not really. Many of the Malaysian-based solar factories are Chinese-owned. And wafers, which primarily come from China, remain a key component. (Solar companies based in Japan, the U.S., South Korea and Singapore also own plants in Malaysia.) David Sandalow, a veteran of the Clinton and Obama administrations now at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, says such concentration in the supply chain is not a good thing, and it will be important to see production spread more evenly around the globe. But he noted that the dependence is mutual: Chinese companies need American buyers. ""If Chinese manufacturers stopped selling to the U.S., other manufacturers would enter the market,"" Sandalow said.  The authors of the CSIS report caution, though, that ""wafer factories are expensive and technically challenging to build."" Rodgers’ claim that 80% of the wind machines are from China or Asia is not right. Three large components go into wind turbines — towers, blades and generators, the units that actually convert the motion of the spinning blades into electricity. The import patterns look a little different for each. The U.S. Energy Department’s latest report shows China providing a fifth of all the imported blades. But for towers, China doesn’t rank in the top five among countries selling to the U.S. And for wind-powered generating systems, China accounts for about 5% of imports. In dollar terms, China represents only 16% of imports to the U.S. for all wind power parts, nowhere near the 80% Rodgers claimed.   However, wind turbines rely on powerful magnets, and those magnets need compounds that tend to come from China.  Rodgers specifically highlighted rare earth minerals and their tie to renewables. The connection is strongest for wind power and electric vehicles. The magnets in wind turbines and electric car motors require neodymium and dysprosium, two of the 17 rare earth minerals. She also mentioned batteries, which are essential to storing power from wind and solar, and for running electric cars and trucks. Batteries rely on cobalt and lithium, which are not on the list of rare earth elements. The Democratic Republic of the Congo dominates the cobalt supply. Australia and Chile produce most of the world’s lithium. China dominates the production of rare earth minerals on a commercial scale. Between 2016 and 2019, China supplied 80% of the U.S. demand for these materials. China also accounts for about 80% of global production.   The main caveat is that supply chains aren’t locked in for all time. While these minerals are called ""rare earth,"" they are not rare. Neodymium, for example, is about as common as zinc or lead. The problem is they generally aren’t concentrated enough to make commercial extraction worthwhile.  In testimony March 22 before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, former Obama administration Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said ""there’s no doubt, as a sane energy security issue, we need to work to diversify these sources of minerals and their processing.""  That effort is underway. In 2019, the Trump administration triggered the Defense Production Act, and the Pentagon signed contracts with domestic suppliers. The U.S. government now has a stockpile of 600 tons of neodymium. Building more robust supply chains even rated an executive order from President Joe Biden. With an eye toward finding chemical substitutes, the government’s Advanced Research Projects Agency is backing research to make magnets that are rare-earth-free.  However this pans out, part of current clean-energy policy focuses on weaning the U.S. off its dependence on China. Rodgers said that the Democratic clean energy plan is pro-China, because ""90% of the solar panels, 80% of the wind machines, 90% of the rare earth minerals … are in Asia or in China."" China produces over 90% of silicon wafers, a key building block in solar panels. China produces 80% of the rare earth minerals used in the U.S. for magnets used in electrical vehicles and wind turbines, though its role in wind power overall is far less dominant. But Rodgers' conclusion that the Democrats’ legislation amounts to a pro-China agenda omits key context about the overall direction of U.S. government policy. For some time and continuing today, the U.S. has been working to diversify its supply base and shrink its reliance on Chinese materials",Half True,"March 29, 2021"
“Democrats have accomplished a lot in just 2 months ... 1 Million energy jobs destroyed.”,"House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy took to Fox News to highlight the damage purportedly wrought by Democrats since President Joe Biden took office. He summarized his comments in a tweet. ""Democrats have accomplished a lot in just 2 months,"" McCarthy tweeted March 14. ""Higher gas prices. Biden's border crisis. 1 Million energy jobs destroyed."" Democrats have accomplished a lot in just 2 months:❌ Higher gas prices❌ Biden's border crisis❌ 1 Million energy jobs destroyedAnd they’re just getting started. pic.twitter.com/8gUGmL0QFL The press of unaccompanied minors and families at the Mexico border is real. Gas prices have gone up, though most of the increase took place under President Donald Trump, and is driven by an improving economy and global oil markets, rather than Washington policy. McCarthy’s statement about 1 million energy jobs, which he also made in the Fox News interview, is way off. We reached out to McCarthy’s office for an explanation and did not hear back. The 1 million figure in his claim number aligns with a forecast from the American Petroleum Institute, a group that represents the oil and gas industry, but McCarthy misrepresented what the number means. In September, the American Petroleum Institute wrote that under a total ban on oil and gas leasing, ""nearly one million jobs would be lost by 2022."" Here’s why that doesn’t back up McCarthy’s claim: The study assumed all new leasing and new drilling on existing leases for oil and gas on federally controlled land and waters would stop completely. The Biden administration fulfilled its campaign promise to put new leasing on hold, but production on current leases continues uninterrupted. Plus, there are over 7,000 approved drilling permits that oil and gas companies have yet to use.  The study estimated total job losses, not energy job losses. The underlying model forecast a decline in the national economy, and translated that into an overall decline in employment. McCarthy spoke of 1 million energy jobs. It is a projection, and as the underlying study itself noted, projections ""are not predictions of what will happen, but rather modeled projections of what may happen."" McCarthy’s statement holds Democrats responsible for hypothetical results as if they’ve actually taken place. Philip Jordan with BW Research tracks jobs in the energy sector for the National Association of State Energy Officials. Jobs in the oil, gas and coal industries have declined due to the pandemic downturn, Jordan said, but that was about 120,000 jobs, and took place before Biden took office. Jordan said that McCarthy’s number is implausible on its face. ""The total of fossil fuel industries combined have about 1.6 million jobs,"" Jordan said. ""A million energy jobs lost? I think the math is impossible."" McCarthy said in the past two months, Democrats led by Biden have ""destroyed 1 million energy jobs."" The 1 million figure matches a number from an American Petroleum Institute report, but that report assumed all new oil and gas development on federal property would cease, while the Biden policy affects only new leasing. And the projected job losses were across the entire economy — not solely in energy. McCarthy spoke as if the jobs were actually lost in the past two months, but the figure came from a projection, which might never come to pass",False Pants on Fire,"March 17, 2021"
“Pipelines do not freeze. They are naturally insulated. They’re buried beneath the ground.”,"A week after last month’s deadly failure of the electric grid amid historically cold weather, state lawmakers sought answers from grid operators, energy regulators and oil and gas industry executives.   On Feb. 26, during the second and final day of hearings, lawmakers heard from Grant Ruckel, senior director of government affairs for Energy Transfer — one of the largest pipeline companies in the U.S.   Ruckel was asked about gas pipelines and their role in hampering the gas-fired power plants that struggled to generate electricity at optimal levels during the worst of the storms.   ""Just to be clear, you didn’t have pipelines that froze up — right?"" asked state Rep. Chris Paddie, R-Marshall, chairman of the House State Affairs Committee who has received $3,000 from Energy Transfer’s political action committee. ""Pipelines do not freeze,"" Ruckel said. ""They are naturally insulated. They’re buried beneath the ground.""  His response contradicts what others have said about how natural gas infrastructure faltered during Texas’ winter storm. Grid operators said last month that problems occurred up and down the natural gas production and delivery system — from frozen wellheads to frozen gas-fired power plants.   And Gov. Greg Abbott repeated those claims during a televised interview with WFAA-TV, the ABC affiliate in Dallas, on Feb. 16.  ""My team has been talking to all the natural gas producers and suppliers in the state of Texas all afternoon to accelerate the process of their ability to get (gas),"" Abbott said. ""Their answer is: ‘It's just frozen right now. It's frozen in the pipeline. It's frozen at the rig. It's frozen at the transmission line.’""  Did gas pipelines freeze during Texas historic winter storm? As with many things in the energy sectors, the answer to this question is tangled in technical complexity.  Oil and gas pipeline experts all agree that even the sustained freezing temperatures Texas experienced last month couldn’t freeze gas in pipelines the same way water would. For instance, to turn methane — a fuel commonly used to power gas-fired electricity plants — from a gas to a liquid state would require temperatures around negative 83 degrees Celsius. The process of freezing natural gasses to a liquid state using cryogenics is common for transporting gas products in large tankers, experts said.  ""To take it as literal, that natural gas is frozen in the pipelines, would require temperatures that I don't think have ever been found on the surface of this earth, outside of a cryogenic process,"" said Tony Scott, managing director of analytics at the industry research group BTU Analytics.  ""It’s just a misunderstanding of the system,"" said Chuck Fontenot, vice president of operations at WSP USA, an energy management and consultancy firm whose clients have included Energy Transfer. ""As a rule, natural gas does not freeze.""  It’s also true that natural gas pipelines are required to be buried underground by the U.S. Department of Transportation, and all of Energy Transfer’s 43,500 miles of Texas pipeline meet the U.S. Department of Transportation’s minimum depth standard of 3 feet, the company said.  Although this depth requirement is primarily meant to protect pipelines from damage or interference incurred from agriculture or digging, burying pipelines can serve a dual purpose of keeping temperatures stable. In many northern states, pipeline companies bury pipelines well below the federal minimum standard to dip below frozen ground.   ""Certain companies can choose to do even more for their use,"" Fontenot said. ""Up north they bury pipelines deeper in areas that stay frozen for months on end because the ground stays frozen down to a point. It kind of depends on where you are and where that typical frost depth is. This could be up to 6 feet in the northern U.S.""  An Energy Transfer spokesperson asserted that the company’s pipeline in Texas ""never stopped operating"" during the winter storm. But that doesn’t mean the storm spared mid-stream natural gas infrastructure from harm.  Mid-stream systems, the infrastructure that carries fuels from upstream oil wells to downstream refineries and power plants, include several stages that were compromised by Texas’ winter storm.   After natural gas is separated from the oil and water that are co-mingled in the stream flowing out of an oil well, the gas enters a processing plant where the natural gas is again divided into propane and methane, which is sent on to power plants.  But because many of these processing plants run on electricity and were also cut off from power, they struggled to supply the power plants with enough gas to produce electricity.   ""You end up in this very cyclical feedback where everyone’s out at the same time and they all need the other to get restored,"" said Scott. ""That's the cascading loop of failures when you have such cold temperatures in an area that's just not prepared.""  The sustained freezing temperatures hampered natural gas primarily in the upstream sector. Upstream producers in the fields struggled with things like frozen wellheads and icy roads that prevented trucks from servicing well sites.   Natural gas production in Texas fell from around 21 billion cubic feet of gas to less than 14 billion, and gas moving from more than two dozen West Texas processing plants to pipelines fell by 85%, according to the energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.  A pipeline company executive testified before a legislative panel last week and pushed back on claims that pipeline infrastructure froze during Texas winter storm. Ruckel said that pipelines don’t freeze because they are ""naturally insulated"" by being buried underground.   Gas pipelines are required to be buried underground by the U.S. Department of Transportation, although the purpose of burial is more for protection than insulation from winter weather.   It’s also accurate that natural gas itself doesn’t freeze, and only reaches a liquid state under a cryogenic process",True,"March 5, 2021"

Says Joe Biden “will redirect the $30 billion” that Donald Trump “left for U.S. farmers to ‘climate change.’”,"Is President Joe Biden taking $30 billion that former President Donald Trump intended for farmers and using it for climate change instead? That’s the claim of a widely shared image on Facebook. Alongside a photo of Biden, it states: ""Biden will redirect the $30B — that Trump left for U.S. farmers — to ‘climate change.’""   The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The $30 billion fund was created in 1933 to support agriculture broadly; it wasn’t something left behind by Trump. Trump used it to pay farmers who suffered from retaliatory tariffs imposed by China and other U.S. trading partners. Biden would use at least some of it to pursue climate change goals, but that money would still go to farmers.  The $30 billion reference is to the Commodity Credit Corp., a government corporation created in 1933 with an executive order by President Franklin Roosevelt. Overseen by the Agriculture Department, the corporation has borrowing authority of $30 billion at any one time from the U.S. Treasury to broadly support the agriculture industry. Annual appropriations from Congress replenish its borrowing authority. The Trump Administration used CCC’s authority to respond to retaliatory tariffs imposed by China and other trading partners on U.S. agricultural exports. That included authorizing up to $12 billion in payments to farmers in 2018 and up to $16 billion in 2019. But CCC funds are not something that Trump could reserve; and its funds are not strictly for farmers.  According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, the funds can be directed to programs that include ""commodity and income support, natural resources conservation, export promotion, international food aid, disaster assistance, agricultural research and bioenergy development."" The Agriculture Department told us the CCC currently has a balance of about $17.8 billion in borrowing authority. Biden’s nominee for agriculture secretary is Tom Vilsack, a former Iowa governor and the secretary of agriculture during the Obama administration. Vilsack said during his Senate confirmation hearing Feb. 2 that the administration wants to use CCC funds to create a carbon bank. It would be used to pay producers for practices that capture carbon in soil. He said the fund could provide incentives to reduce tillage of soil that can release carbon into the atmosphere, and keep vegetation growing on fields longer so that it can withdraw more carbon from the atmosphere. But no plan is in place and there is some question about whether Biden would need legislation to use the fund toward climate initiatives.  It’s also not clear how much of the fund would be used toward climate change versus other initiatives.  In his stimulus plan, Biden identified the fund as a potential source of economic relief for restaurants and bars, as many have suffered financially during the pandemic. An image widely shared on Facebook claimed that Biden ""will redirect the $30 billion"" that Trump ""left for U.S. farmers to ‘climate change.’"" This is a false choice. Biden’s nominee for agriculture secretary has said the administration wants to tap a $30 billion fund that’s available for supporting agriculture broadly to pay farmers to use farming practices that meet climate change goals. It wasn’t started by Trump. But no plan has been announced, and Biden has indicated he also wants to tap the fund for other purposes, such as helping restaurants that have suffered financially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Here is what NASA actually says about climate change.  The earth’s climate has changed throughout history, and over 800,000 years, most of those changes are due to small variations in the Earth’s orbit, which affects how much solar energy the planet receives. But today’s trends are not a result of just variations to Earth’s orbit. NASA says there’s a greater than 95% probability that most of the current warming trend is the result of human activity since the mid-20th century. Increased levels of so-called greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, cause the Earth to warm by blocking heat from escaping the atmosphere and radiating it back toward the Earth’s surface.  Carbon dioxide can be released through, say, volcanic eruptions, but humans have also increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide by 47% since the Industrial Revolution started. Methane can likewise be produced through both natural sources and human activities, such as agriculture and livestock manure management. ""Human activities are changing the natural greenhouse,"" NASA says. ""Over the last century the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, the clearing of land for agriculture, industry and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases",False,"February 16, 2021"

Says that Hurricane Harvey “dropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.”,"John Kerry, President Joe Biden's new special envoy on climate, appeared on CNN Jan. 31 to lay out the Biden administration’s whole-of-government approach to addressing climate change.   The cost of taking no action on climate change will far outweigh the price of preventing its worst-case scenario, Kerry argued, pointing to three recent storms — hurricanes Maria, Harvey and Irma — whose damages cost the U.S. a combined $265 billion.   And then Kerry threw out a striking detail: ""Harvey dropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year,"" he said.  It’s true that Hurricane Harvey produced rainfall levels that have never been experienced in the U.S. in recorded history. According to Texas State Climatologist John Nielson-Gammon, the amount of rainfall that fell during a five-day period across 10,000 square miles of Texas and Louisiana exceeded the previous record set in 1899 by 62%.  In Harris County alone, which contains the bulk of the city of Houston, the storm dropped an average 33.7 inches of rainfall across the county’s 1,777 square mile area. But is that amount of rainfall more than the volume of water that flows over Niagara Falls in a full year?  A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of State said that Kerry’s remark was based on a 2017 Washington Post article reporting that Harvey had dumped 24.5 trillion gallons of water on Southeast Texas and southern Louisiana.  The article also mentions, for comparison sake, that 1 trillion gallons of water flows over Niagara Falls every 15 days, and Kerry’s office used that number to extrapolate the amount of water that flows over the falls in a year.  ""A trillion gallons falls over Niagara Falls every 15 days. So, in the course of 365 days, that is about 24.3 trillion gallons of water,"" said state department spokesperson James Dewey. That back-of-the-envelope calculation is correct, and it closely lines up with official estimates. Niagara Falls State Park estimates that 757,500 gallons flow over the falls each second, which is equivalent to 65.4 billion gallons per day, or 23.8 trillion gallons per year.   In either case — be it Kerry’s estimate of 24.3 trillion gallons flowing over Niagara per year or the state park’s 23.8 billion estimate — both figures are less than the 24.5 trillion gallons of water Harvey unleashed.  However, there’s a key detail that Kerry gets wrong.  While it might be true that Hurricane Harvey dropped more water within a week than flows over Niagara Falls in a year, not all of that Harvey water fell on Houston or Harris County alone.   Harvey made landfall near Rockport on Aug. 25, 2017, then drifted eastward over the next several days, dropping torrential rain on the Houston metro area. Three days later, the storm’s center moved back offshore and restrengthened over Matagorda Bay where it gained its peak intensity. Then on Aug. 30, the storm made landfall again in southwestern Louisiana moving northeastward over the southern United States while continuing to produce heavy rainfall.  The majority of the storm’s total rainfall fell over Southeast Texas, where 60 counties were under a disaster declaration, and southern Louisiana, where 13 counties were under a disaster declaration. The storm grew weaker as it moved over Tennessee and Kentucky, where it finally dissipated. Counties in both states issued flash flood warnings as areas received up to 7 inches of rain. All told, the storm had unleashed a grand total of 33 trillion gallons of water.   Kerry’s statement would have been accurate if he had said Harvey dropped more water on Texas and Louisiana, or the southern U.S., over five days — instead of just Houston — than the amount that flows over Niagara Falls in a year.  A 2018 report by the Harris County Flood Control District also made a comparison between the amount of Harvey rainfall and the amount of water that flows over Niagara Falls.   ""A total of 1 trillion gallons of water fell across Harris County over the 4 day period which would fill NRG Stadium 1,472 times and cover Harris County’s 1,777 sq. miles with an average of 33.7 inches of water. This volume of water would also run Niagara Falls for 15 days,"" the report said.  After PolitiFact reached out to Kerry’s office about the misstatement, a spokesperson said that the issue has been brought up to staff and that Kerry would be more careful with that statistic.  ""In a recent interview with Fareed Zakaria on CNN, Secretary Kerry said Hurricane Harvey 'dropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year,'"" a spokesperson said in a statement. ""The statistic Secretary Kerry referenced is for water Hurricane Harvey dropped not just on Houston, but on southeast Texas and southern Louisiana.""    Kerry said on CNN that Hurricane Harvey dropped more water on Houston in five days than the amount of water that flows over Niagara Falls in a year.   By the time Harvey dissipated it had dropped around 33 trillion gallons of water primarily on Texas, Louisiana and, to a lesser extent, Tennessee and Kentucky. By comparison, about 23.8 trillion gallons of water flows over Niagara Falls per year.   Kerry’s comment errs in narrowing Harvey rainfall to Houston, and his office acknowledged the misstatement. In fact, 1 trillion gallons were dumped on Harris County, which would be equivalent to the volume of water that spills over Niagara Falls in 15 days",False,"February 5, 2021"
"Says that Biden’s ban on new federal leases will kill 120,000 Texas jobs.","President Joe Biden made good on his promise to take action on curbing U.S. emissions when he issued an executive order halting new oil and gas leases on federal lands and water.   The order, signed Wednesday, directs the Department of the Interior to pause issuing leases to oil and gas companies pending a review of the climate impacts of the department’s leasing and permitting practices. About 22% of U.S. oil production is reliant on federal lands and waters.   Anticipating Biden’s move, U.S. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, expressed dismay at how a moratorium on leasing would impact jobs in Texas’ oil and gas sector.   ""Killing more Texas jobs,"" Brady said in a Jan. 22 tweet. ""After killing #KeystoneXL pipeline, #Biden suspends new oil/gas leasing on fed lands/water. If permanent, 120,000 TX jobs lost. 120,000 MORE jobless. Pssst... aren't you supposed to CREATE jobs?""  Biden’s move will have a disproportionate effect on states with large swaths of federal lands used for oil and gas activity. New Mexico, for instance, has 24 million acres of federal land, or about 32% of the state’s total land mass; Wyoming has 29 million federally owned acres, or about 47% of the state.  Texas, on the other hand, has very little federally-owned land — 3 million acres, or 2% of the state. Nearly half of that is managed by the U.S. National Park Service. As of 2019, about 185,000 acres were under lease for oil and gas production in Texas.  Although most of Texas’ oil and gas industry is based onshore, a sliver of the industry is actively drilling in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico. As of Jan. 22, there were 16 offshore rigs in the Gulf compared with 175 on Texas land, according to the Baker Hughes rig count. (In February last year, before the coronavirus pandemic dealt major blows to the global oil industry, about 20 rigs were deployed in the Gulf compared to around 400 onshore in Texas.)  With such a small fraction of the state’s industry likely impacted by Biden’s directive, is Brady correct when he says that 120,000 Texas jobs are at stake?  According to Brady’s aides, the number he cited is pulled from a study released last year by the American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade and lobbyist group. The study estimated that a ban on new and existing leases would cost nearly 1 million jobs by 2022, with top production-states hit the hardest. While Texas would lose 120,000 jobs, New Mexico would lose 62,000 and Wyoming would lose 33,000, the study says.  But the Biden administration’s moratorium on federal land leasing halts only new leases from being issued. Brady’s tweet misses this distinction. He said that the ban on new leasing would cost Texas 120,000 jobs, while the study he cited totaled losses tied to banning both new and existing leases. The petroleum institute hasn’t released estimates of how many jobs will be impacted by Biden’s order. Another group, the Wyoming Energy Authority, released a study last month that determined a ban on new leasing alone would impact 58,700 jobs in the eight states that make up the majority of public land production, which does not include Texas. However, an American Petroleum Institute spokesperson said it's reasonable to expect the administration will expand the ban to include existing leases as well.  ""We view this as a first step toward a federal leasing ban that would impact all oil and gas development on federal lands and water,"" said spokesperson Bethany Aronhalt.  This expectation is based on numerous remarks the president has made on the issue. For instance, during a 2020 primary debate, Biden said ""no more drilling on federal lands. No more drilling, including offshore. No ability for the oil industry to continue to drill, period — ends."" And Aaronhalt highlighted how Biden's nominee for interior secretary, environmentalist and progressive Deb Haaland of New Mexico, has been unequivocal in her opposition to leasing federal lands and waters to the industry.  ""I am wholeheartedly against fracking and drilling on public lands,"" she told The Guardian in 2019. ""Public lands are a statement about who we are as Americans. The most pristine and beautiful places in our country should never belong to one person."" If Biden did ban all federal leasing — new and existing, onshore and offshore — does Texas stand to lose 120,000 jobs by 2022?  ""Most of the Texas impact is due to closing development of the Gulf of Mexico, of the offshore"" drilling, said Geoff Brand, Senior Economic Advisor at the American Petroleum Institute.  Drilling in the Gulf of Mexico supports about 300,000 jobs, according to a Bureau of Ocean Energy Management estimate. This figure represents both jobs created directly by industry — like offshore drilling, platform construction and platform staffing — and the jobs indirectly created by the industry, like service companies and other onshore support operations. In economic terms, the 300,000 figure represents jobs created by the industry’s direct, indirect and induced economic impacts.  That workforce is sourced primarily from Texas and Louisiana, each of which contribute about 150,000 workers to the offshore industry, Brand said. The projected 120,000 Texas jobs lost due to a possible ban on new and existing federal leases would impact roughly 80% of Texas’ offshore workforce.  This figure is so high, Brand said, because most jobs are created when the industry spends capital up-front on drilling new wells and constructing new platforms. A complete ban on new leasing or permits would grind that development to a halt.  ""If you stop drilling and expanding, then you’re just maintaining production platforms,"" Brand said. ""It's kind of like building a pipeline — you get most the jobs up front when you spend the capitol and build things. It’s when you spend the money that the jobs are created. ... If you're maintaining a platform, you're spending some operational money, but you're not really spending that much.""  The American Petroleum Institute’s study is based on the National Energy Modeling System, a model of domestic energy markets created by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The model bases employment numbers on the industry’s rate of spending. The harder it becomes for producers to obtain leases and permits, the less they’re spending on development, which, as a result, sheds jobs.   The methodology behind the institute’s analysis is unobjectionable, according to Karr Ingham, a petroleum economist with the Texas Alliance of Energy Producers.  ""If that activity is just stopped wholesale, what do you think's going to happen to those jobs?"" he said.  ""Even someone who's utterly opposed to energy production, offshore production, federal lands production, whatever the case may be, taking issue with the way they went about this (analysis) would be a difficult proposition. They started with a sound model and went through sound processes to end up with state-level impacts,"" Ingham said.  Although the industry will adjust to Biden’s directive by reallocating resources to drilling on non-federal lands and waters, those adjustments will be gradual and may not impact short-term economic projections.   Similarly, it will take time for jobs in the fossil fuel industry to be replaced by jobs created in new energy sectors. The administration has stressed the importance of green job creation as it shrinks the fossil fuel sector. Biden’s Build Back Better economic recovery plan pledges to ""create millions of good-paying union jobs"" by building a ""clean energy economy.""  But Ingham says it will take time before these new industries are replacing lost fossil fuel jobs on a one-to-one ratio.  ""If a job gets lost some time in the next 12 months, what are you going to replace that job with? Where are those folks going to go"" Ingham said. ""It's not like for every job you eliminate in the oil and gas sector, a green energy job springs up on the other side.""  Anticipating Biden’s move to ban leasing on federal lands and waters, Brady said that a permanent ban on new leasing will cost Texas 120,000 jobs.  Brady pulled that number from a report released last year by the American Petroleum Institute. However, the institute said that the 120,000 figure is based on a ban of both new and existing federal leases, which is more far-reaching than Biden’s actions so far. Brady’s comment ignores that distinction.   Otherwise, the 120,000 job losses projected by the institute’s analysis is accurate given that it was based on modeling from the federal National Energy Modeling System",Half True,"January 29, 2021"
“84% of all new electric capacity planned to come onto the electric grid this year is clean energy.”,"In his rollout of major actions on climate change, President Joe Biden laid out his 2035 goal to see an electricity sector that puts zero carbon into the air. Biden emphasized that the change is underway. ""Already, 84% of all new electric capacity planned to come onto the electric grid this year is clean energy,"" Biden said Jan. 27. ""Why?  Because it’s affordable; because it’s clean; because, in many cases, it’s cheaper."" The part about 84% of new electricity capacity being clean energy stood out, and we dug into it. The latest government data backs him up. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the new electric capacity slated to come online in 2021, measured in total gigawatts, will be 39% solar, 31% wind, 11% from batteries, and 3% nuclear. That’s where Biden got his 84%. Do those sources really amount to ""clean"" energy? There’s a separate debate over nuclear power, because while it’s carbon-free, there’s the long term problem of nuclear waste. But that aside, there’s also room to question the inclusion of battery power, as the federal government does. ""Batteries probably shouldn’t be in the total,"" said energy economist Kenneth Gillingham with Yale University. ""They are not actually generating electricity. They are simply storing it for use at other times."" Gillingham underscored that the link between batteries and renewables is strong, because batteries are vital to building the market for solar and wind power. But today, he said, batteries could well be charged with fossil-fuel powered electricity. Taking batteries out of the total, at least 70% of the new electric power capacity is carbon-free, which isn’t too far from what Biden said. Still, while electricity from wind and solar has grown rapidly, it represents only about 10% of the national total. Fossil fuels power over 60% of the nation’s electricity supply.  A peek at the details of the latest government report shows a surge of new renewable power coming online in December 2021. The Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group, said that’s a result of federal investment tax credits. Those credits let  facility owners deduct a percentage of the project cost from their taxes. Until Congress changed the law at the end of 2020, that particular financial incentive was due to drop from 22% in 2021 to 10% in 2022. With millions of dollars in play, companies didn’t want to lose the 12-point difference and moved projects along as quickly as they could. The experts we reached said several factors led the country to see less new capacity fueled by natural gas, and more by renewables. On top of the tax credits, technology improvements, state and local level policies to boost renewable power and demand from utilities and industry combined to make renewables the leading option. The 2021 number is no outlier. There have been ups and downs, but over the past 10 years, renewables have averaged over 57% of new utility-scale electric capacity. Susan Tierney, senior adviser with the private consulting firm Analysis Group in Denver, said Biden’s statistic shows progress on the climate change front, but it also underscores how much remains to be done. ""It is clear that there will need to be continued, and accelerated, additions of renewables, storage, and other zero-carbon technologies in upcoming years, in order to decarbonize the electric system,"" Tierney said. ""The 84% increase is just one more year’s increment, and many multiples of that amount will be needed."" Biden said that 84% of new electric capacity scheduled to come online in 2021 was from clean energy. The number is credible, but it includes 11% from battery storage. Batteries are essential to the expansion of wind and solar power, but they are not necessarily ""clean"" energy sources; they could be charged with electricity produced from fossil fuels. Taking batteries out of the equation still leaves a total of about 70% from wind and solar. However, renewables remain a lesser slice of electricity supply. About 60% of the nation’s electric power comes from fossil fuels",Mostly True,"January 29, 2021"
Says Joe Biden is “following through with a fracking ban.”,"An old campaign attack continues to dog President Joe Biden. A Jan. 25 post on Facebook juxtaposes two news articles: one from the Washington Post and one from Townhall, a conservative news site. The former article says Biden won’t ban fracking, while the latter says he ""followed through"" with a ban. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Throughout the 2020 presidential election, we fact-checked many claims that Biden would ban fracking, a process used to extract oil and gas from the ground. Several of them misrepresented his position, so we wanted to take a closer look at this post. (Screenshot from Facebook) We found that it, too, distorts Biden’s actions by making them appear more sweeping than they really are. In short, Biden is doing what he said he would do if elected — that is, ban new fracking on federal land. On his first day, Biden signed an executive order that put a hold on all oil and gas development in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. On Jan. 27, he signed an additional executive order that pauses new oil and gas leases on federal land, effectively banning new fracking there for as long as the policy lasts. His moves leave current fracking untouched. Let’s take a closer look at the Facebook post. The top of it shows the headline of a Washington Post fact-check published in early October. It debunked a Trump campaign ad that said, if elected president, Biden said he will end fracking. The headline: ""Trump campaign promotes false claim that Biden would end fracking."" The second article in the Facebook post purportedly shows ""what Biden is doing,"" and was published by Town Hall on Jan. 20. Its headline said: ""Biden Administration: Yes, We Are Following Through With a Fracking Ban."" The Townhall article covers an interaction at the first press briefing of the Biden administration. (The article more accurately explains the type of fracking that Biden promised to block.) On Jan. 20, White House press secretary Jen Psaki answered a reporter’s question about the executive order that Biden signed that day about Alaska oil and gas drilling. Here’s the exchange, in context: Reporter: ""President Biden promised to end all new oil and gas leasing on federal lands when he was a candidate. The order that you just mentioned that he signed today was much narrower than that — it's a temporary moratorium and it only applies to (the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge). And there is some debate about whether he has the legal flexibility to even follow through with his full promise. Does the administration still have that commitment today? Psaki: ""We do, and the leases will be reviewed by our team. We just have only been in office for less than a day now"" What Biden signed was an executive order that paused the federal government’s implementation of the Coastal Plain Oil and Gas Leasing Program in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The Trump-era program, passed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, directed the Interior Department to issue leases for drilling oil and natural gas in the refuge’s coastal plain. Biden’s order also reinstated an Obama-era policy that withdrew certain areas of the Arctic from consideration for oil drilling. ""The Secretary (of the Interior) shall review the program and, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, conduct a new, comprehensive analysis of the potential environmental impacts of the oil and gas program,"" Biden’s executive order says. Biden’s move tracked with his climate change plan, which calls for banning fracking on federal lands but not all fracking. RELATED: Biden Promise Tracker On Jan. 27 — after the Facebook post and Townhall article were published — Biden signed an additional executive order that directs the interior secretary to ""pause new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review."" It would effectively prevent new fracking projects on federal land. The Interior Department said the order ""does not impact existing operations or permits for valid, existing leases, which are continuing to be reviewed and approved."" Biden reiterated that point in remarks to the press. ""Let me be clear, and I know this always comes up: We're not going to ban fracking,"" he said. The Facebook post says Biden is ""following through with a fracking ban."" That’s not quite right. Biden has signed two executive orders related to land leases for oil and natural gas drilling. One order pauses new leases specifically in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, while the other pauses new leases on all federal land. Neither ban existing fracking operations, and Biden has said repeatedly that he does not intend to do so.

The post is inaccurate — Gates never said 3 billion people should die to stave off the effects of climate change. Other fact-checkers have debunked the viral claim. The clip comes from a video uploaded to YouTube in November 2019 by the International Tribunal for Natural Justice, a group that has aired false claims that 5G technology helps the coronavirus spread. The video features testimony from Robert O. Young, a man who claims to have ""successful treatments to cure cancer."" Young’s work is based on the theory that acidity is the cause of all disease and that an alkaline diet is the cure. In 2017, he was sentenced for practicing medicine without a license in California. In September 2020, the Federal Trade Commission sent Young a warning letter for making a variety of ""unsubstantiated claims for coronavirus prevention and treatment"" on his websites. Young’s comments about Gates start about an hour and a half into the video. Later, he says international health agencies are ""using chemical warfare against all of us."" Young also likens vaccines to poison. Vaccines have saved millions of lives over the years. Young’s comments about Gates take something the billionaire said about climate change out of context. In 2010, Gates gave a TED Talk on energy and climate change. During the presentation, he lays out four factors that could help countries zero out their carbon dioxide emissions. One of them is population. ""The world today has 6.8 billion people. That's headed up to about 9 billion,"" he said. ""Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15%. But there, we see an increase of about 1.3 (billion)."" Gates wasn’t talking about decreasing the population — he was talking about decreasing its rate of growth.  In their 2014 annual letter, Bill and Melinda Gates wrote that there is a strong positive correlation between infant mortality and birth rates. They argue that decreasing infant mortality rate by expanding access to health care and education could lead to slower population growth over time. ""When children are well-nourished, fully vaccinated, and treated for common illnesses like diarrhea, malaria, and pneumonia, the future gets a lot more predictable,"" the letter says. ""Parents start making decisions based on the reasonable expectation that their children will live."" We found no evidence that Bill Gates has advocated for the death of 3 billion people in African countries. The Gates Foundation told PolitiFact that the claim is false. In fact, Gates makes clear in the 2014 report that he does not support letting people die to slow population growth. ""We make the future sustainable when we invest in the poor, not when we insist on their suffering,"" the letter says. The Instagram post is inaccurate",False,"January 27, 2021"
"The Paris Climate Agreement is “bad for America,” because it ""does nothing to hold real polluters, like Communist China and India, accountable.""","President Joe Biden has been systematically undoing former President Donald Trump’s policies on climate change. Case in point — Trump took the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement. On Biden’s first day, he signed paperwork to bring the United States back in. Under the Paris agreement, about 200 nations promised to set goals to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. Each nation decides for itself what its goal will be. The hope is that cumulatively, those reductions would limit global temperature increases to no more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, criticized Biden’s move.     ""We have to stop joining deals that are bad for America,"" Scott said in a statement to the press. ""President Biden is throwing the U.S. back into the Paris Agreement just to appease his liberal friends. This deal does nothing to hold real polluters, like Communist China and India, accountable."" There’s debate over how well the agreement’s overall approach will meet the challenge of climate change. Here, we focus on Scott’s claim that the agreement puts the U.S. at a disadvantage because it does nothing to hold ""real"" polluters like China and India accountable.     Under the agreement, each country submits a set of greenhouse gas reduction targets called a Nationally Determined Contribution. Countries have been sending these to the United Nations since they launched the agreement in 2015, with new or updated goals due in 2020, and every five years after that. For example, in its 2016 plan, China said that by 2030, it would lower carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 60% to 65% compared with 2005 releases. So, while its emissions would rise as its economy grew, they wouldn’t rise as much as they would have if everything worked the way it did in 2005. China said it would aim for carbon dioxide emissions to peak in about 2030. India set a more modest goal of cutting emissions by 33% to 35% per unit of GDP by 2030. Both China and India had additional goals on their list.  Scott said the agreement has no way to hold nations accountable if they stray from meeting their goals. Benjamin Zycher, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a market-oriented think tank, said Scott has a point. ""The Nationally Determined Contributions are strictly voluntary,"" Zycher said. ""There is no enforcement mechanism."" Zycher is no fan of the Paris agreement. But even those who think it holds promise agree that it lacks teeth. ""There are no penalties other than naming and shaming if these pledges are too weak or are not fulfilled,"" said Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School. Countries are required to report their progress publicly. Law professor Daniel Bodansky at the Arizona State University College of Law said transparency matters, and those progress reports are not simply taken on faith. ""The agreement provides for both expert and peer review of these reports,"" Bodansky said. Holding to international norms is a form of pressure, Bodansky argued. Zycher countered that China is autocratic and can ignore domestic and international pressure more easily than the United States, Canada and Europe. Gerrard said Scott’s reference to China and India was misleading. ""It implies that China and India are subject to weaker requirements than the U.S.,"" Gerrard said. ""That is incorrect."" The agreement’s compliance rules might be weak, but they apply equally to all participating countries. The Biden administration will determine how ambitious the U.S. goals will be when it rejoins the agreement. At this point, we don’t know what those will be. Gerrard and Bodansky both fault Scott for calling China and India the ""real polluters."" The actual rankings are more complicated. As this chart shows, by one measure, China releases more carbon dioxide than the U.S. By another, the U.S. tops China.   ""The United States is the second biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world, and has higher per capita emissions than either China or India,"" Bodansky said. ""It is misleading to point the finger at China and India and label them as the real polluters."" By the yardstick of carbon dioxide releases relative to the size of the economy, the latest numbers come from 2016 World Bank data. China was at the top with 0.5 kilograms per dollar of GDP, with India and the U.S. tied at 0.3 kilograms per dollar of GDP.  We reached out to Scott’s office and did not hear back. Scott said the Paris Climate Agreement is bad for the United States because it fails to hold ""real polluters"" such as China and India accountable.  People who study the agreement agree that it lacks teeth to hold each country to its carbon dioxide reduction goals. But its rules apply equally to all nations. China and India are treated the same as the U.S.  China emits almost twice as much carbon dioxide as the U.S., but per person, the ranking is flipped, and the U.S. emits twice as much as China. By both standards, India emits much less than either country. The Paris agreement lacks strict enforcement, but Scott’s comparisons to China and India are misleading",Mostly False,"January 26, 2021"
"Says that the Paris Climate Accord will cost the U.S. economy ""6.5 million jobs and $3 trillion in economic growth by 2040.""","Wayne Christian is fed up with environmentalists and what he described as the ""woke"" liberal policies threatening to disrupt the smooth recovery of Texas’ energy sector from pandemic blows.  The Republican oil and gas regulator, one of three commissioners of the Texas Railroad Commission, penned a missive earlier this month that took aim at those who've recently cast Texas natural gas in a bad light — the French government for cutting ties with a Houston company over environmental concerns, the ""sensationalist fake-news media"" for downplaying improvements in emissions, and the ""environmental extremists"" for promoting Green New Deal policies. In the letter, posted to the agency’s website on Jan. 5, Christian took a swipe at President Joe Biden’s pledge to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord, which he fulfilled on his first day in office by executive order. Former President Donald Trump withdrew in 2017 from the international treaty, designed to reduce carbon emissions, although terms of the agreement stipulated that the U.S. could not formally exit until Nov. 4, 2020.  ""This would be a tremendous mistake,"" Christian wrote. ""The accord carries sky-high costs with very low benefits and unfairly imposes a double standard based on unproven assumptions and climate models that are wrong nearly all the time.""  Then Christian pointed to a 2017 study released by an economic research firm on behalf of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Council for Capital Formation, a pro-business think tank on economic policy.  ""The cost of the Paris Climate Accord to the American economy is steep. The agreement will cost American workers 6.5 million jobs and $3 trillion in economic growth by 2040,"" Christian wrote, citing the 2017 study.  The study, entitled ""Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Regulations On the Industrial Sector,"" was also cited by Trump when justifying his decision to withdraw from the Paris accord.   ""The cost to the economy at this time would be close to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs, while households would have $7,000 less income and, in many cases, much worse than that,"" Trump said in his 2017 announcement from the Rose Garden.  The bleak outlook sparked scrutiny over the figures. When the U.S. initially joined the accord in 2016, the Obama administration set long-term goals for reducing economy-wide emissions by 80% from 2005 levels by 2050. The administration listed a mix of existing and planned policies that would help the U.S. meet that goal, but reductions stemming from those policies would still fall short of the 2050 target.   Although there’s debate over how far short the policies would come, ""it is clear that such a gap cannot be filled without contributions from the industrial sector,"" reads the study, which was conducted by NERA Economic Consulting. The profit and job loss figures cited by Christian and Trump represent the economic cost of closing that gap according to NERA’s analysis.   Trump and Christian repeat the report’s findings accurately. More restrictions on fossil fuel emissions mean higher cost of production, and higher cost of production means the closure of uncompetitive manufacturing businesses, and those closures mean fewer manufacturing jobs. These losses and their knock-on effects beyond the manufacturing sector would amount to 1.1 million jobs lost by 2025 and 6.5 million by 2040, according to NERA.  The loss of jobs results in a corresponding decline in gross domestic product, with a loss of $250 billion by 2025 that accelerates to $3 trillion by 2040.   ""The decline in GDP accelerates over time as the targets become much more difficult to comply with and the targets start to constrain output in all sectors,"" the study says.  But the study’s authors note an important caveat to their key findings that Trump and Christian omit. Not only are the long-term projections subject to a great deal of uncertainty, they said, the study did not factor in all of the offsetting job gains and GDP growth associated with a clean tech transition.  In a news release following Trump’s announcement of U.S. withdrawal from the Paris agreement, NERA stated that ""the Trump administration selectively used results"" from its study.  ""NERA’s study was not a cost-benefit analysis of the Paris Agreement, nor does it purport to be one,"" their statement said. ""The objective of the study was to estimate the range of cost sensitivity associated with meeting deep U.S. emissions targets under alternative implementation approaches affecting U.S. industrial sectors. NERA’s study does not provide any recommendations regarding any specific international agreements.""  There’s a smattering of predictions for how climate action will create opportunities for economic growth. For instance, a 2018 report by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate — an economic policy initiative commissioned by seven countries in 2013 — says that the green transition could create $26 trillion in benefits across the global economy by 2030. And as new technologies accelerate the transition, new jobs could be created therewith.  For example, over a million Americans are employed in the fossil fuel sector while close to half that amount are employed in solar and wind, even though solar and wind comprise just 10% of the energy mix, according to the commission's report.   ""It is expected that reduced employment in fossil fuels through the transition can be more than offset by a rise in employment in renewables and construction,"" the study said.   Globally, the commission found that low-carbon jobs may employ up to 65 million people by 2030, which could offset employment reductions in declining sectors.   When asked about considering possible offsetting benefits in his criticism of the Paris accord, Christian only questioned the logic of eliminating existing energy jobs while subsidizing jobs in renewables. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, global direct subsidies to renewables are expected to increase from $166 billion in 2017 to $192 billion in 2030, while subsidies to fossil fuels fall from $447 billion to $165 billion over the same 13-year period.  ""I do not see a benefit in putting in place punitive policies that eliminate well-paying energy jobs and then using our taxpayer dollars to create new jobs through subsidizing other less efficient forms of energy,"" he said. Under the Paris accord, the U.S. committed to reducing emissions by about 25% by 2025 compared to 2005 levels. Biden’s move to rejoin the accord means that the U.S. must submit an emission reduction plan, although the details are not yet known.  ""Since our state makes up 40% of the nation's production, we will be disproportionately impacted compared to other states in terms of economic and job loss,"" Christian said.  The NERA report also doesn’t factor in the cost of climate-related disasters that, by most scientific accounts, are projected to increase in frequency as global temperatures rise. Over the past two decades, global climate-related disasters — primarily floods and storms — accounted for $2.3 trillion in damages, with the U.S. bearing the brunt of the economic losses, according to a report by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction. Under a future scenario with limited or no emission reductions, these disasters are expected to worsen in severity and frequency, meaning that a business-as-usual response to climate change can cost the economy trillions.  ""Current economic models are deeply inadequate in capturing the opportunities of such a transformational shift, or the grave dangers of climate inaction,"" the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate study says. ""We need a new class of economic models that can capture the powerful dynamics at play, including technological advances, preservation of essential natural capital, and the full health benefits of cleaner air and a safer climate including the containment of pandemic diseases.""  Like Trump, Christian has been vocal skeptic of climate science. He was first elected to the Railroad Commission in 2016 having attracted endorsements and contributions from industry groups, energy companies and other state officials.   He’s repeatedly made arguments against global warming and its man-made causes, calling those who underscore future impacts of climate change ""climate catastrophists.""  ""These activists repeatedly imply that climate change is ‘settled science’ and that 97 percent of scientists agree that the main reason for global warming is manmade greenhouse gasses. However, real science is never ‘settled’ and 97 percent of scientists don’t agree. ... This is far from settled science,"" Christian wrote in a 2019 letter to Gov. Greg Abbott.  A 2016 survey of scientific studies found that 97% of actively publishing climate scientists agreed on the cause of global warming.  ""The vast majority of actively publishing climate scientists – 97 percent – agree that humans are causing global warming and climate change,"" according to NASA. ""Most of the leading science organizations around the world have issued public statements expressing this, including international and U.S. science academies, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and a whole host of reputable scientific bodies around the world.""  Christian wrote in an open letter that reentry into the Paris Climate Accord will ""cost American workers 6.5 million jobs and $3 trillion in economic growth by 2040,"" accurately citing a study released in 2017 by NERA Economic Consulting.   Those figures were similarly referenced by Trump in justification of his decision to withdraw from the accord. After that announcement, authors of the study said the ""Trump administration selectively used results"" and failed to consider key limitations of their findings.   Christian similarly omitted these caveats",Half True,"January 21, 2021"
“The Green New Deal would require that 99% of homes in the country be torn down and rebuilt more ‘energy efficient’ over a ten year period.”,"When introduced in early 2019, the Green New Deal resolution immediately sparked conversation and intense criticism, some of it stemming from mistakes made by its sponsor during the rollout.  An FAQ distributed to the media by staff for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., one of the Green New Deal sponsors, included language and policies not found in the resolution. The original version of the FAQ, which was quickly retracted, included a goal that continues to attract attention: ""Upgrade or replace every building in U.S. for state-of-art energy efficiency"" over a 10-year-period.   Close to two years later, social media users continue to refer to that now-retracted sentence about replacing buildings. One Instagram post says, ""The Green New Deal would require that 99% of homes in the country be torn down and rebuilt more ‘energy efficient’ over a ten year period."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The original FAQ distributed by Ocasio-Cortez’s staff included references to ""farting cows"" contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and the need to guarantee economic security for those ""unwilling to work,"" which were not included in the resolution.  According to the Washington Post, more than a dozen media outlets reported on policies that were listed in the retracted FAQ but not included in the legislation.. Just this month, President Trump falsely claimed that as part of the Green New Deal, ""They literally want to take buildings down and rebuild them with tiny little windows,"" according to The Hill.   The final version of Ocasio-Cortez’s FAQ removed the language about ""upgrading or replacing every building"" and instead said one of the goals is, ""upgrading virtually every home and building for energy efficiency."" That could be accomplished by replacing items such as windows, doors and insulation, as well as electricity and plumbing systems, according to Curbed. The plan would be for the federal government to provide incentives for homeowners to make those improvements. The think tank that is helping to develop the Green New Deal acknowledges that making those types of changes to some homes, particularly older ones, could expose bigger structural or safety problems, according to Fast Company. The think tank says it is studying those issues and policies that could address them. The Green New Deal is a nonbinding resolution that cannot become law in its current form.  An Instagram post says, ""The Green New Deal would require that 99% of homes in the country be torn down and rebuilt more ‘energy efficient’ over a ten year period.""  An FAQ about the Green New Deal that was later retracted included a goal of upgrading or replacing every building in the U.S. for energy efficiency within 10 years. It did not mention tearing down 99% of buildings.  The updated version of the FAQ mentions only upgrading buildings for efficiency, which can include replacing elements of the home, such as windows and electrical systems",False,"November 1, 2020"
"""Nancy Mace denies climate change.""","The re-election campaign of U.S. Rep. Joe Cunningham, D-S.C., created a website for attacking his opponent, Republican state Rep. Nancy Mace. ""Nancy Mace denies climate change"" is one of Cunningham’s claims on MaceFacts.com. In statements made since September, Mace has not always ruled out the impact of human beings, but she has consistently resisted an embrace of climate change. Several times, she has suggested the science is inconclusive.  The race pitting Mace, a state representative since 2018, against first-time House member Cunningham is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking.  The Cook Political Report rates the match-up as ""lean Democratic,"" meaning the race is competitive but Cunningham has an advantage. According to NASA, the Earth’s climate has changed throughout history. But ""the current warming trend is of particular significance because most of it is extremely likely — greater than 95% probability — to be the result of human activity since the mid-20th century and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented over decades to millennia."" Evidence for the ""rapid climate change"" includes a global temperature rise, warming of the oceans and shrinking ice sheets. Here’s a look at six sets of statements Mace has made, focusing on instances where she has spoken at some length. At a Sept. 3 event sponsored by the Post and Courier, a newspaper in Charleston, a reporter who said he was posing a question from a reader asked Mace if she believes in climate change. Mace began her answer by saying:  ""I’m kind of mixed on this. I’m not a scientist, and I’ve read science on both sides of this issue. To me, it’s not clear cut. I know that here in downtown Charleston, we’re seeing rising sea levels. And that could be a product of the climate, but that’s also partially a product of the peninsula being largely built on landfill in many places."" When the reporter followed up by asking Mace what she’s not sure about, Mace said: ""So, if you look at the history of Earth, we’ve had climate changes many times, over 130 times over millions of years. And so part of it might be man-made; part of it might be just natural environmental causes as part of the cycle of Earth."" She added: ""I think it’s more complicated than people really realize. You can’t say one or the other when there’s data on both sides of the issue. And I read about scientists that have flipped from one side to the other — both ways — so it’s hard to understand and know which one is right."" The Washington Examiner reported Sept. 11 that it asked Mace to clarify her position on climate change.  Mace replied, according to the newspaper, that ""she is ‘not a scientist’ and acknowledged sea levels are rising, but whether it is caused by ‘man-made’ climate change or natural reasons is ‘up for debate.’"" In a questionnaire, the Post and Courier asked Cunningham and Mace: ""Do you believe in climate change?"" The answers were published Sept. 13, with Mace saying: ""I’m not a scientist, but I do know we should consider all available data. South Carolina’s 1st Congressional District is in a unique part of the country subject to massive flooding and Atlantic storms, compounded by our low elevation."" At their first debate, on Sept. 28, Cunningham and Mace were asked if they ""agree with the overwhelming majority of scientists who say that climate change is happening due to manmade greenhouse emissions leading to an increase in extreme weather events."" Mace replied: ""My opponent is going to tell you I’m a climate denier, which is dishonest. My opponent has said that the science is settled on this. Well, the science is never settled. Scientists will tell you that. I look at the issue from every angle and try to find a solution, as I’ve done as a state lawmaker. Scientists once said the Earth was flat and it’s not, and so these things are evolving, as well."" At their second and final scheduled debate, on Oct. 7, Cunningham and Mace were asked about what has caused a recent rise in the sea level in the area and what they would do about it. Mace said: ""Our Earth has had over 130 climate changes over its history. We are facing great climate change. We’re seeing an increase in the number of hurricanes, sea levels are rising."" In response to Cunningham’s attack, Mace’s campaign cited to PolitiFact an article published Oct. 14 in the Charleston City Paper. The newspaper said it asked Mace if humans are causing climate change, and she responded: ""Does man contribute to it? I mean, a lot of the science says that,  too, but I want to stay informed and do as much as we can, but the other thing that’s important to me is that we just cannot simply rely on the United States (to address it)."" Cunningham’s claim that Mace ""denies climate change"" is accurate, but needs some clarification. Mace has hedged on the issue, saying the science isn’t conclusive",Mostly True,"October 19, 2020"
"“With regard to hurricanes, the National Oceanic (and Atmospheric) Administration tells us that actually, as difficult as they are, there are no more hurricanes today than there were 100 years ago.”","As Hurricane Delta headed for the Gulf Coast, Vice President Mike Pence downplayed a connection between climate change and natural disasters striking the country, from wildfires to hurricanes. Susan Page, who moderated the Oct. 7 vice presidential debate, asked Pence if he believed, ""as the scientific community has concluded, that man-made climate change has made wildfires bigger, hotter, and more deadly and have made hurricanes wetter, slower and more damaging?"" Pence started his response by saying, somewhat inaccurately, what the Democratic presidential ticket would mean for fracking and the Green New Deal. ""With regard to hurricanes, the National Oceanic Administration tells us that actually, as difficult as they are, there are no more hurricanes today than there were 100 years ago,"" he said. That comment might sound surprising given the busy 2020 hurricane season. Hurricane Delta was Louisiana’s fourth hurricane or tropical storm of the year. And for only the second time in history, forecasters in 2020 used up all 21 of the year’s Atlantic storm names and had to resort to Greek letters.  On the numerical comparison, Pence has a point. Hurricanes that reach U.S. land are happening about as often as they did 100 years ago. But that isn’t all the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other scientists have to say about hurricanes and climate change. Focusing only on the number of storms obscures warnings from NOAA and other scientists about the effect of climate change on future storms.  ""If we are thinking about what to expect in the coming century, it’s not just a matter of extrapolating what we saw in the past century,"" said Gabriel Vecchi, a former NOAA scientist who is now a Princeton University professor. Scientists are more concerned about the intensity of future storms. Phil Klotzbach, a scientist at Colorado State University, said scientists are continuing to disentangle questions about climate change and hurricanes. But it’s clear that skyrocketing population growth along the coast means storms today are more costly and destructive than 100 years ago, and sea level rise means more dangerous flooding from storm surge.  Pence didn’t specify whether he was referring to hurricanes that made landfall around the world, or just in the U.S. (The Trump campaign did not respond to our request for clarification.) The most reliable data is for U.S. landfalling hurricanes, so we’ll start there.  Jeff Masters, meteorologist for Yale Climate Connections, said it is true that the number of U.S. mainland landfalling Atlantic hurricanes has not changed appreciably in the past 100 years. There was one year about a century ago, in 1916, when nine tropical storms or hurricanes hit the mainland U.S. With Hurricane Delta, 10 have hit the U.S. this year. ""We are cruising through names at a record pace, but largely thanks to a lot of weak and/or short-lived ones,"" said Brian McNoldy, a University of Miami hurricane researcher. ""This is in stark contrast to the 2005 season, which also went into the Greek alphabet for the first time but produced many long-lived and very intense hurricanes."" This year’s busy season doesn’t necessarily mean we should expect more storms. ""Computer modeling results of Atlantic hurricanes are inconclusive on whether or not climate change will cause an increase or decrease in the number of Atlantic hurricanes in a future warmer climate, with some models showing a decrease, and some showing an increase,"" Masters said. ""But what theory and modeling do agree upon is that we will see the strongest hurricanes get stronger. Observations suggest that we are already seeing that occur."" Masters pointed to a June 2020 research article by scientists at NOAA and the University of Wisconsin-Madison that looked at global storms from 1979 to 2017. The number of major hurricanes — Category 3 or stronger — increased globally by 15% in the later half of that period. Major hurricanes are significantly more damaging than a Category 1 or 2 storm.  A September NOAA research analysis concluded that future hurricanes will be more intense with higher rainfall rates as a result of global warming. NOAA has said that rising sea levels, another effect of climate change, will increase the threat of storm-surge flooding during hurricanes. Pence said that NOAA said ""there are no more hurricanes today than there were 100 years ago."" The data from NOAA show there’s no major difference between the number of storms today and a century ago. But his statistic doesn’t mean a lot on its own. What matters more is the intensity of hurricanes, and how climate change and sea level rise will affect future intensity",Half True,"October 14, 2020"
"Says Joe Biden’s website shows that he supports the Green New Deal, despite denials in debate.","Former Vice President Joe Biden is being challenged on social media over his muddled messaging on the Green New Deal during the first presidential debate.  A TikTok post plays a clip of the presidential debate in which Biden said he doesn’t support the Green New Deal. The video then shows a screenshot of Biden’s climate action plan, which calls the deal a ""crucial framework"" for acting on climate challenges. The TikTok user holds up a sign calling Biden a ""liar.""  Interrupted repeatedly by President Donald Trump, Biden struggled during the debate to explain where he stood on the Green New Deal.  ""The Green New Deal is not my plan,"" he said. Shortly after that, he said the Green New Deal would ""pay for itself as we move forward.""  When pressed by moderator Chris Wallace, Biden responded, ""No, I don’t support the Green New Deal."" Biden went on to say that he supports ""the Biden plan that I put forward … which is different."" In the Oct. 7 vice presidential debate, Biden’s running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, was also pressed on the issue, with Vice President Mike Pence calling the Biden plan a ""$2 trillion version of the Green New Deal"" and noting that Harris cosponsored a Green New Deal resolution in the Senate. Harris advocated for the Green New Deal in 2019, when she was a presidential candidate. When moderator Susan Page asked specifically for the Biden-Harris campaign’s view on the Green New Deal, Harris didn’t give a direct answer, and she pivoted to discussing investments in clean-energy jobs.  Biden’s campaign didn’t return requests for comment. But essentially, Biden has claimed that he doesn’t ""support"" the Green New Deal as is. Rather, he has said, he used it as a framework to build his own plan.  So what makes Biden’s plan different? Let’s start by looking at the Green New Deal.  The Green New Deal was a 2019 House resolution sponsored by Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. On its own, it would not have changed any laws. Rather, it listed a variety of climate change and environmental justice goals — such as universal access to clean water, resiliencies against extreme weather, and pollution and carbon emission reductions ""as much as technologically feasible.""  It called on federal lawmakers to enact a 10-year ""national mobilization"" plan to achieve those goals, and said the world needs net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 to prevent severe impacts of climate change.  Biden’s climate plan echoes some of that language, but differs significantly in scope. For example, it also calls for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. But it’s missing some of the environmental justice goals the Green New Deal included. While Biden may share these goals, his climate plan doesn’t specifically include calls for universal access to high-quality health care and affordable housing.  Biden’s climate action plan gives a nod to the Green New Deal as ""a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face."" According to his website, the plan borrows ""two basic truths"" from the Green New Deal: that the U.S. needs to be more ambitious, and that the environment and economy are connected.  The TikTok post claimed that text on Joe Biden’s campaign website proves that he supports the Green New Deal, despite his denials in the first presidential debate.  Biden’s plan shares some of the Green New Deal’s goals, and he has acknowledged that his plan was inspired by it. But his plan differs in scope",Half True,"October 8, 2020"

The Sept. 20 post features the man’s mugshot and implores users to ""meet mr. climate change"" and says he’s ""responsible for lighting 32 of the wildfires.""  The man in the image, Brandon McGlover, did light fires in California, and he was arrested and sentenced for it — but it happened in 2018, and there weren’t 32 fires. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In July 2018, deputies from the Riverside County Sheriff's Department in California arrested Brandon N. McGlover on charges of five counts of arson to wildland. (The amount of fires linked to McGlover was later upped to nine.) One of the fires McGlover was accused of setting became the Cranston Fire, which destroyed multiple buildings, forced thousands of evacuations, and burned over 13,000 acres before it was fully contained. Contemporaneous news reports said that a heat wave in California exacerbated the fire’s spread. McGlover pleaded guilty to arson charges for the Cranston Fire in 2019 and was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Fire officials and experts believe that the West Coast’s 2020 wildfire season has been mostly fueled by a combination of severe drought, historic heat, lightning storms and heavy winds.  There are a couple of exceptions. A man was arrested on charges of arson and cultivating marijuana in connection with California’s Dolan Fire, and officials said San Bernardino County’s El Dorado Fire was caused by a device at a gender reveal party. A post suggests climate change has nothing to do with the fires burning in the Western U.S., blaming instead one man for setting 32 wildfires. That isn’t true. Brandon McGlover was arrested in 2018 for lighting nine fires in southwest California and is currently serving a 12-year prison sentence. Also, experts say that climate change has modified environments in the West Coast, making them more conducive to wildfires",False,"September 21, 2020"
Map shows that wildfires stop at the US.-Canada border.,"Some social media users are using a map of wildfires in the United States to illustrate a political point: that the flames can’t be caused by climate change because they stop at the nation’s borders.  The map shows red markers depicting where fires are burning in the states. There are no such markings north or south of the U.S. border.  A screenshot of a tweet from the actor James Woods shows the map.  ""Hey, Governor Newsom, why does ‘climate change’ stop abruptly at the Canadian border?"" he wrote, addressing California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who described the fires in his state as a ""climate damn emergency.""  Facebook posts sharing the screenshot were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The tweet in which Woods shared the map has been deleted. But other Twitter users have also tweeted about it, and drawn the attention of climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, the director of the Texas Tech Climate Center who has contributed to multiple National Climate Assessment reports.   ""The latest disinformation circling the twittersphere asks why the impacts of climate change appear to stop at the Canadian border,"" she tweeted on Sept. 13. ""The answer is simple: because US maps only show US data."" The natural resources department in Canada keeps updated information about the wildfires in its country here. As of Sept. 9, the last time the ""National Wildland Fire Situation Report"" was updated, there were five uncontrolled fires, 11 that weren’t anticipated to grow considering the current circumstances, and 47 controlled fires, meaning they’re contained and will be extinguished.  ""Following a years-long series of extreme wildland fire seasons, 2020 has been one of Canada’s quietest since the 1990s,"" the agency says on its website.  In the United States, meanwhile, 87 large, active fires have burned more than 4.6 million acres in 10 states, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Only four fires are contained.  Hayhoe also addressed this difference between the two countries in a Twitter thread addressing ""popular wildfire myths."" She said that while Canada has fewer wildfires ""at the moment,"" it will have more than the U.S. at another point. ""That’s weather, a single day, week or year. Climate change is the long-term trend over decades,"" she wrote.  Some social media posts have shared this map and suggested that it disproves that the fires are connected to climate change, something that affects the entire world and is not sequestered to the United States. Online, people are arguing about what caused the fires — poor forest management, arsonists, or global warming. Most wildfires in the lower 48 states are ignited by humans, but they’re burning a much greater area due to drier conditions caused by climate change, Hayhoe said.    As we’ve previously reported, climate change has affected the environments where the fires are burning on the West Coast right now, making them more conducive to wildfire. Experts have told us unequivocally that climate change has contributed to the frequency, intensity and scope of wildfires there",False,"September 15, 2020"
"West Coast wildfires are due to “bad forest maintenance,” not climate change.","At a rally in Nevada on Sep. 12, President Trump claimed that the wildfires currently raging across the West Coast have resulted from poor ""forest management."" Trump, who denies the existence of climate change, has made similar statements before in talking about a deadly firestorm near Paradise, Calif., in 2018 and again in 2019. We rated these statements False for being overly simplistic and reducing a complex issue to a single cause.   A Facebook post parrots Trump’s language, dismissing the possibility that global warming has contributed to the fires. ""Climate change my a--,"" it reads. ""CA fires are due to total lack of forest maintenance.""  Another post makes a similar claim: ""Bad forestry practices and 60 yr. old power lines caused the Calif. fires not the climate change hoax.""  The wildfires, which include some of the largest infernos in the recorded history of the Western U.S., have claimed 35 lives so far and washed the skies of West Coast cities in orange.  We asked experts what’s fueling them — poor forest maintenance or human-caused climate change. They agreed that while good forest maintenance is critical to mitigating wildfires, it’s climate change that’s making them burn so forcefully. Climatologists, ecologists and wildfire experts all told us that climate change has not only fueled the fires but also worsened their impact.  The regional climate has warmed considerably over the last few years, with 2014-18 being California’s five hottest years on record. In the last four decades, the area burned by wildfires has expanded tenfold. According to Noah Diffenbaugh, a climate scientist at Stanford University, ""about half"" of that increase is attributable to the effects of global warming.  There are many lines of evidence that climate change has exacerbated the likelihood of fires by modifying environments across the region. Climate change has raised overall temperatures along the West Coast, contributed to a long period of drought, reduced snow deposits in the mountains, and dried out vegetation, essentially covering forest floors with fuel. All of these developments have increased the risk of wildfires and the probability that they spread over great distances.  An article in Science written by a group of researchers breaks down this process in detail. Simply put, forests in mountainous regions of the Western U.S. get moisture during the spring and summer months from melting snowpacks. The warming of the climate has led to drought, which means that there’s less snow on the ground left over from the winter. Since temperatures are now rising earlier in the year, the already reduced amount of snow melts much quicker than it used to, leaving dried out twigs, pine needles and grasses on the forest floor. All of this dehydrated vegetation essentially turns forests into big tinderboxes, increasing their flammability. Climate change has also made other types of ecosystems more likely to catch fire. Rising temperatures have lowered the amount of vapor in the air, which leads the atmosphere to suck more moisture out of the soil, drying it out and making it more conducive to wildfires.  Under these conditions, all environments in the Western U.S. have become more likely to catch fire during ignition events like lightning strikes, heavy winds, downed power lines, or sparks from pyrotechnic devices, such as those used in a gender reveal party blamed for a fire in Yucaipa, Calif. ""There are always accidental sparks, but the conditions don’t favor extremely large wildfires all the time,"" said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA. ""As the background conditions shift in that direction, it’s much more likely for these sparks to start a catastrophic blaze."" A study published in August 2020 by Diffenbaugh, Swain and their colleagues found that the number of days per year with extreme wildfire weather in California has more than doubled since the early 1980s, primarily due to increased dryness in the soil.  Wildfires ""are increasing in their likelihood,"" said Diffenbaugh. ""They’re increasing in their intensity. And managing those risks requires an acknowledgement that the climate is warming."" The role of climate change in making wooded areas more flammable doesn’t negate the importance of forest management. There are a number of steps forestry departments can take to decrease the risk of widespread fires, including thinning out small trees, setting strategic burns to prevent the buildup of dry vegetation, and clearing brush.  Swain said that a strict fire suppression policy set by federal forest agencies has likely contributed to the frequency of intense forest fires. Small, contained fires actually lower the risk of high-intensity fires by burning through dry fuel collected on the forest floor. However, many federal agencies followed a policy of extinguishing all fires, regardless of their scope. In doing so, they inadvertently allowed dry vegetation to pile up, increasing the likelihood of massive infernos like the ones we’re seeing. Trump has blamed California agencies for poor forest management, but the state owns just 2% of forest land in the state, while the federal government owns upwards of 60%. The sharp increase in the frequency of wildfires over a wide range of locations can’t be explained by forest management practices alone. Swain noted that the majority of wildfires actually aren’t forest fires at all. ""Most fires aren’t burning trees, they’re burning other forms of vegetation,"" he said. ""Forest management isn’t relevant unless you live in a forest."" Many of the experts we spoke with were frustrated by the way that the debate over the West Coast fires has been framed. Claiming that either poor forest management or climate change is the single factor behind the wildfires doesn’t capture the fact that they are complex phenomena that result from a confluence of conditions.  ""It’s really inaccurate to attempt to reduce the rising occurrence of large, highly destructive wildfires to one ingredient alone,"" Diffenbaugh said.  Climate change has already ensured that fires will occur at a higher intensity and frequency than they did in the past, and forest management is one of the most important techniques that the West Coast can use to cope with that reality.  ""We have to adapt to climate change, and forest management is part of that set of tools that we can use,"" said Susan Prichard, a fire ecologist at the University of Washington.  Viral Facebook posts dismiss the possibility that climate change is fueling the West Coast wildfires, instead citing ""bad forestry practices"" and ""a total lack of forest maintenance."" Experts told us that climate change has undoubtedly contributed to the frequency, intensity and scope of wildfires along the West Coast, and that forest maintenance can be used to mitigate those effects in forests",False,"September 15, 2020"
The United Nations’ “new world order” agenda will create one world government with one world military and the end of national sovereignty.,"A May 9 Facebook post is claiming that the United Nations is planning to create ""one world government"" by 2030. Under the vision, the post says, private property is banned and family units are destroyed. The post shares a photo of what looks like a document titled ""New World Order UN Agenda 21/2030."" It includes a purported list of 25 goals that the United Nations aims to achieve by 2030.  ""This is not a conspiracy theory,"" the caption says. It suggests the document can easily be found on the internet.  ""If you don’t believe it, a simple google search will take you to the UN website where you can access the document and read it for yourself. It is amazing (not) how well the Covid-19 plandemic ties in with Agenda 21/2030.""   Among the agenda items listed on the document depicted in the post is the end to all national sovereignty, private property and single-family homes; government control of businesses, schools and child-rearing; and ""the end of the family unit."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has racked up thousands of shares on Facebook and Twitter A United Nations spokesperson told PolitiFact that the document and the agenda it outlined is false. ""This is not an authentic U.N. document,"" the spokesperson said in an email. (AFP and BuzzFeed have previously fact checked this photo and deemed it false.) The post refers to two numbers — 21 and 2030 — that are connected to actual U.N. documents. ""Agenda 21"" is a non-binding plan of action that was created at the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro. It examines the connection between environmental, social and economic issues affecting communities world-wide, and proposes solutions for sustainable development and combating poverty, with private-sector involvement. It calls for strengthening the role of women, local leaders, workers, farmers, entrepreneurs and even private business and industry in promoting sustainable development. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was adopted by each country in the U.N. in 2015. The agenda includes 17 sustainable-development goals that are to be achieved over 15 years, including ending poverty and hunger, achieving gender equality, combating climate change, and ensuring access to clean water and affordable energy.  There are some common threads between the goals in the 2030 U.N. plan and what’s listed in the Facebook post, but in each case, the post exaggerates or distorts them.  For example, the U.N.’s 2030 agenda proposes a goal of reducing the rates of child and maternal mortality in every country. This goal supports research and development of vaccines and medicines for diseases primarily affecting developing countries, according to the U.N. But it doesn’t call for ""mandatory multiple vaccines"" or ""the ban of natural non synthetic drugs and naturopathic medicine"" as the Facebook post claims.  Similarly, the U.N. agenda advocates for free, suitable and quality primary and secondary education and lifelong learning opportunities. But it says nothing about ""government owned and controlled schools.""  The U.N. agenda includes ensuring universal access to ""affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy,"" not the end of private transportation or fossil fuels, as the Facebook post says. The caption on the post invokes the term ""plandemic"" to suggest that the COVID-19 crisis is aligned with the purported U.N. agenda. ""Plandemic"" is the title of a 26-minute video airing various conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 crisis. PolitiFact fact-checked eight of the most misleading claims in the video, which Facebook and YouTube removed.  We also fact-checked another doctored United Nations document in 2013 that claimed a civilian gun confiscation plan was in the works in the United States, and was created through Agenda 21",False Pants on Fire,"July 24, 2020"
"Says Joe Biden plans to “mandate net-zero carbon emissions for homes, offices and all new buildings by 2030. That basically means no windows, no nothing.”","At a Rose Garden speech on July 14, President Donald Trump made multiple attacks on Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, saying his policies went too far left. One of those attacks included an accusation that task force recommendations from Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders included a mandate that would get rid of windows on buildings. Trump said that Biden plans to ""mandate net-zero carbon emissions for homes, offices and all new buildings by 2030. That basically means no windows, no nothing."" The Biden-Sanders recommendations set a goal for having all new buildings achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. They don't say anything about a mandate. The plan also doesn’t mention windows — and the presence of windows in a building does not mean that a building can’t achieve net-zero carbon emissions. The White House and Trump’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment. The Biden and Sanders task force recommends setting a goal to reduce buildings’ impact on climate change, but not a mandate. This is what the task force recommendation says: ""We will set a bold, national goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions for all new buildings by 2030.""  That target is included in Biden’s sustainable energy and infrastructure plan, which his campaign released July 14. The plan seeks to achieve a ""net-zero emissions standard for all new commercial buildings by 2030.""  The Energy Department defines ""zero energy buildings"" as those that ""combine energy efficiency and renewable energy generation to consume only as much energy as can be produced onsite through renewable resources over a specified time period."" Residential and commercial buildings contributed to 35% of U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in 2019, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Biden plans to invest in companies to incentivize them to update four million buildings to make them more efficient, according to the task force recommendations. In addition, the task force expects Democrats to work on state and city levels to make buildings more energy efficient. The Green New Deal, a far-reaching climate proposal introduced in February 2019 by Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., set out to upgrade all buildings in the U.S. to make them as energy efficient as possible. The plan wasn’t brought to a vote in the House and failed to advance in the Senate. Biden’s clean energy and environmental justice plan, released in June 2019, called the Green New Deal ""a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face."" The Democrats’ task force document doesn’t mention windows at all, and buildings with windows can have net-zero emissions. Steve Capanna, director of U.S. Climate Policy and Analysis at the Environmental Defense Fund said that Trump’s claim that Biden and Sanders want to get rid of windows is ""preposterous."" ""President Trump’s claim is not accurate,"" Capanna said. ""The Biden-Sanders team certainly is not proposing eliminating windows."" Capanna said that Biden’s target is ambitious, but there are already programs in place that push for energy efficient buildings. Those plans include measures for efficient windows. The Energy Department’s Zero Energy Ready Home program certifies homes that have more energy-efficient heating and cooling, insulation, and water distribution systems. The department also certifies zero-energy commercial buildings. The agency and the Environmental Protection Agency have a related program to encourage energy-efficient products and practices that includes guidelines for energy-efficient windows. Efforts to make buildings more energy-efficient don’t center around getting rid of windows. Rather, they include using ""sufficiently insulated windows,"" as outlined by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Capanna said that older, less efficient windows can let warm or cool air escape a building. That contributes to energy loss, ""which means you have to heat the building more."" However, improvements that made windows more efficient in recent years include having multiple panes and allowing in more natural light, which reduces the need for artificial light, Capanna said. Trump said that the Biden-Sanders task force ""mandate net-zero carbon emissions for homes, offices and all new buildings by 2030. That basically means no windows, no nothing."" Biden has a net-zero emissions goal for new buildings by 2030, but his plan doesn’t mention a mandate. Neither the task force recommendation nor Biden’s new climate plan say anything about getting rid of windows, and net-zero emissions buildings can have windows (and many do).

"“We’ve also seen in the time that he’s (Donald Trump) been president, an increase in carbon emissions going absolutely in the wrong way.”","During a House committee hearing on President Donald Trump’s budget proposal, U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky questioned the White House’s acting budget director on major cuts Trump’s plan would make to the Environmental Protection Agency. ""Does this budget propose cutting funding for the Environmental Protection Agency?"" Schakowsky, an Evanston Democrat, asked Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget Russell Vought. ""It proposes a cut to EPA by about 26% and we believe that we will still be able to fulfill the statutory responsibilities of clean air, clean water, clean —"" Vought said, before Schakowsky interjected with a claim that caught our attention: ""We’ve also seen in the time that he’s been president, an increase in carbon emissions going absolutely in the wrong way,"" she said. In 2018, PolitiFact rated Half True a claim from Trump’s EPA that greenhouse emissions were down under the president, finding that while emissions were continuing to fall, the rate of decline had slowed during Trump’s first year in office. The data at that time did not show emissions were rising. So we wanted to find out whether more recent figures support Schakowsky’s claim that emissions have increased under Trump, and whether the changes suggest a trend going ""in the wrong way."" Overall, emissions are indeed up from 2016 levels following a spike in 2018. After that, carbon emissions again began to decline. Experts interviewed say those incremental changes may have nothing to do with Trump policies. In response to our inquiry, a spokesman for Schakowsky’s office pointed to reports highlighting a 2018 spike in U.S. carbon dioxide emissions following three years of declines. A report published in May 2019 by the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm, estimated CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion rose 2.7% in 2018. It was the second-largest annual increase since 2000, the group reported, though somewhat smaller than an estimate it made earlier in the year based on preliminary data. The largest increase occurred in 2010 under then-President Barack Obama as the economy began its rebound from the recession, according to the group. In a draft report released this month, the EPA noted a similar uptick in 2018 CO2 emissions, which comprise the vast majority of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So Schakowsky is correct there was a spike in carbon emissions on Trump’s watch. In 2019, however, U.S. carbon dioxide emissions fell again, according to several recent international reports. And that drop was not a surprise. Indeed, the preliminary Rhodium report for 2018 noted that while the pace of U.S. emissions decline had slowed since 2016, the group did not ""expect a repeat"" increase the following year. To address that point, Schakowsky’s office sent us a Scientific American article speculating the decline identified in one of the international reports could be ""overly optimistic"" and a Washington Post story highlighting the Rhodium Group’s lukewarm preliminary findings for U.S. emissions in 2019. While a significant decline in coal consumption last year helped drive the overall drop, Rhodium noted, the United States made little progress in other areas. By their accounting, net greenhouse gas emissions remained slightly higher in 2019 than at the end of 2016. ""There are low-cost technology solutions to reduce oil and gas methane emissions,"" the Rhodium report said. ""But their deployment at scale requires strengthening regulations that the Trump Administration instead has been weakening."" It’s also worth noting Rhodium did not attribute any of the emissions changes seen so far to the Trump administration, which has made eliminating federal environmental regulations a priority. Instead, both Rhodium and the federal government pegged the 2018 increase to fluctuations in weather, which drove up heating and cooling needs, and to increased economic growth. ""Overall there has indeed been an increase (or at best little or no change) in carbon emissions since Trump has been president,"" said John Nielsen-Gammon, a climatologist at Texas A&M University, in an email response. ""Whether Trump’s policies have had any significant positive or negative effect on U.S. carbon emissions is a separate question."" Schakowsky said that in the time Trump has been president, the nation has seen ""an increase in carbon emissions going absolutely in the wrong way."" Reports show U.S. carbon dioxide emissions did spike on Trump’s watch in 2018. They fell again last year, but greenhouse gas emissions overall remain higher than they were before he took office",Mostly True,"February 16, 2020"
"“Over the past two years, climate and weather disaster damage has cost the U.S. over $400 billion.”","When it comes to weather and climate change, there has been lots of talk about causes and consequences. In some areas of Wisconsin this winter, rapidly melting snow has overtaken roads and caused sewage to overflow, while flooding and its effects continue to be a concern. The National Weather Service in Green Bay indicated most rivers in northeastern Wisconsin have more than a 50% chance of flooding to some extent. Whether it be the toll on infrastructure or disrupting business operations, weather and climate change carries a monetary cost. On Dec. 10, 2019, the U.S. Senate Democrats’ Climate Committee sent out a tweet arguing Wisconsin roads and bridges are at risk of collapse from severe storms and flooding. That same day, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., tweeted this about the national cost: ""Over the past two years, climate and weather disaster damage has cost the U.S. over $400 billion and our economy will lose over $500 billion annually from lost labor, crop failure and damages related to extreme weather if we don’t #ActOnClimate now."" Is Baldwin right about $400 billion-plus in damages? The source When asked for backup for the claim, Baldwin’s staff pointed to The Fourth National Climate Assessment, a 1,526-page document that examines the effects, risks and course of climate change in the United States.  The Fourth National Climate Assessment is a cooperative effort between experts from academia and government agencies, such as the U.S. Department of Energy, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Department of the Interior.  On page 66, the report indicates NOAA estimates the United States incurred $400 billion in damages from weather and climate disasters from 2015 through April 6, 2018.  But that figure is for different years and a longer time period (three-plus years) than Baldwin claimed. NOAA climatologist Adam Smith from the Center for Weather and Climate at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information in Asheville, N.C., noted the numbers in the report are also a bit dated. He pointed us to newer figures. Baldwin’s reference was to the ""past two years."" She made the statement in December 2019, so examining the two-year span immediately before that, her numbers are dramatically off. NOAA estimates the U.S. experienced $137.8 billion of economic damage from 2018 and 2019 when adjusted for the consumer price index, and $135.6 billion unadjusted.  However, looking at the two most recent full years before Baldwin’s claim — 2017 and 2018 — Baldwin’s figures line up. NOAA estimates the inflation-adjusted damage in those calendar years was $411.7 billion. The NOAA calculation includes damage to buildings and public infrastructure, among other costs. The agency tracks damage from drought, flooding, freeze, severe storms, tropical cyclones, wildfires and winter storms. Smith said in an email NOAA uses data from agencies such as the National Weather Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the National Interagency Fire Center. There are some types of data they do not include due to inconsistencies. ""For example, our disaster cost estimates are actually somewhat conservative, as we don’t account for losses/damages to natural capital assets, mental and physical healthcare-related costs post-disaster, or incorporate all downstream economic impacts,"" Smith wrote. We checked with several experts from academia who agreed that the NOAA numbers are probably the best available for the United States. The agency’s data shows that the number of disasters that topped $1 billion in damages has increased each decade since the 1980s.  There were 119 weather and climate disasters that topped that threshold during the 2010s, up from 59 in the 2000s, even after adjusting for inflation. Over the past three years (2017 through 2019), there was an average of nearly 15 disasters that topped $1 billion in damages.  Our ruling Baldwin said ""Over the past two years, climate and weather disaster damage has cost the U.S. over $400 billion.""

The tracker’s July 29 list of coal fired power stations by country counts 2,459 plants in operation, 256 under construction and 359 planned for construction.

The global tracker’s data shows China at the highest capacity (987,364) followed by the United States (254,332) and then India (225,638). While we found no evidence to back up the numbers in the Facebook post, it is worth noting that the growth of coal isn’t in the United States.  ""It is true that whatever coal the world is going to add, is going to be mostly in the developing world, India and China as well as Southeast Asia,"" Mikulska said.

""Much of these reductions were achieved early on, largely as a result of power plants switching their fuel source from coal to natural gas - a less carbon-intensive energy source; and through the construction of new, highly efficient natural gas power plants, both within and outside the city,"" analysts wrote in ""Inventory of New York City Greenhouse Gas Emissions in 2015,"" published in April 2017.  The city reports its analysis includes all direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions from energy used by buildings and other stationary sources, natural gas distribution within the city, on-road transportation, railways, marine navigation, and aviation within the city’s borders, as well as emissions from wastewater treatment and solid waste from the city, even if it is  disposed elsewhere.     For the country as a whole, data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory Data Explorer show that greenhouse gas emissions decreased 6.8 percent between 2002 and 2013, when Bloomberg was mayor.  John Reilly, co-director of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, called the city’s report a ""carefully done effort."" Also, the federal data the Bloomberg campaign directed us to is the ""authoritative accounting"" of greenhouse gas emissions for the United States, Reilly said.  Reilly called Bloomberg’s statement ""basically accurate.""  But he added some observers could take issue with the claim. He said that ""carbon footprint"" is more often associated with a broader definition than the one the city uses. The broader definition includes the full life cycle of emissions of all goods consumed in the city, such as emissions associated with steel used to produce automobiles sold or used in the city, and methane emissions from cattle raised to produce beef eaten in the city. However, these emissions are difficult to account for accurately, much less control. For these reasons, Reilly said that the city is better off analyzing its emissions as it does, focusing on the narrower definition.      Observers could also take issue with Bloomberg calling New York City’s emissions lower than the ""rest of the country."" The federal data includes New York City, not the country minus the city. Other places in the United States also performed better than New York City, he said. Bloomberg tells a ""legitimate story"" that New York City ranks among the nation’s leaders for taking climate seriously, Reilly said. The city emerged as a leader because of Bloomberg’s focus on the issue as mayor, and the city makes a serious effort to assess its progress, he said.  We consulted other experts who had other reactions. On the left, Greenpeace noted that the 6.8 percent drop in emissions nationwide covered a different period than the New York City report, which includes years 2014 and 2015, beyond Bloomberg’s mayoral tenure.  We were curious about this as well, and we found the most recent city data show that in Bloomberg’s last year as mayor, 2013, there was a 12.8 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared with 2005 levels. While close, New York City's reduction between 2005 and 2013 is not quite twice as much as the country's 6.8 percent reduction between 2002 and 2013.     On the right, the conservative Manhattan Institute connected us with an adjunct fellow there, energy industry consultant Jonathan Lesser, who said that Bloomberg’s claim is ""irrelevant - totally, utterly and completely,"" and that emissions reductions in New York City are ""meaningless from the standpoint of global climate change."" He also noted that the city report does not go back to Bloomberg’s earliest years in office.    Bloomberg said his administration cut the city’s carbon footprint twice as much as the rest of the country.  Bloomberg was in office between 2002 and 2013. During a somewhat different timeframe, 2005 to 2013, the city’s greenhouse gas emissions fell 12.8 percent. During the years of Bloomberg’s tenure, greenhouse gases fell nationally by 6.8 percent",Mostly True,"January 11, 2020"
"""The Australia bushfires have nothing to do with climate change; it was arson.""","A headline on the website of conservative columnist and radio show host Todd Starnes declared: ""The Australia Bushfires Have Nothing to Do With Climate Change; It Was Arson."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Arson is involved — but to a much lesser extent than the claim suggests.  And in the view of numerous experts, climate change is certainly involved: It is making the fires more severe than they otherwise would be. The fires have been exacting a toll for months. According to a BBC News report posted Jan. 7, the same day as the ToddStarnes.com article, the blazes had destroyed nearly 2,000 homes and killed 25 people and millions of animals since September.  As for the cause, the website article claims ""many of the fires were set by arsonists."" The article cites a news story in The Australian that said that more than 180 people have been arrested since the start of the bushfire season and that Swinburne University professor James Ogloff said that about 50% of bushfires were ""lit by firebugs.""  The 180 figure is wrong. New South Wales police reported on Jan. 6 that it has taken ""legal action"" against 183 people for bushfire-related offenses since Nov. 8. But that number includes 24 people charged with deliberately setting bushfires, 53 people cited for allegedly failing to comply with a total fire ban and 47 people cited for allegedly discarding a lighted cigarette or match on land. Not all of these people were arrested, as the Starnes article claims. Moreover, bot and troll accounts are likely involved in a ""disinformation campaign"" exaggerating the role of arson in the fires, according to a social media analysis by a lecturer at Queensland University of Technology in Australia, The Guardian reported. Meanwhile, experts have been widely quoted saying climate change has made the fires worse. A sampling: Associated Press: ""Scientists, both those who study fire and those who study climate, say there’s no doubt man-made global warming has been a big part, but not the only part, of the fires"" — with 2019 in Australia having been the hottest and driest on record. Stanford University environmental studies director Chris Field, who chaired an international scientific report on climate change and extreme events, said this is one of the worst, if not the worst, climate change extreme events he’s seen. BBC News: ""Australia has always experienced bushfires — it has a ‘fire season’ — but this year they are a lot worse than normal … The overwhelming scientific consensus is that rising levels of CO2 are warming the planet. And Australia has been getting hotter over recent decades and is expected to continue doing so."" … Climate change is ""not the cause of bushfires, but scientists have long warned that a hotter, drier climate would contribute to Australia's fires becoming more frequent and more intense.""  USA Today: ""Human-caused climate change is worsening the wildfires scorching Australia, experts say. Climate change is increasing bushfire risk in Australia ‘by lengthening the fire season, decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature,’ according to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology."" A conservative website said: ""The Australia bushfires have nothing to do with climate change; it was arson."" It is widely believed by experts that climate change has made the fires much worse than they otherwise would have been, while the role of arson in causing the fires has been widely overstated",False,"January 10, 2020"
"California firefighters decided ""to speak out"" against President Trump because his tweet about the state’s wildfires ""contained so much misinformation.""","Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden attacked President Trump in a new digital campaign ad, which claims California firefighters ""spoke out"" against the president over his controversial tweet during the state’s deadly November 2018 wildfires.  Trump’s tweet, which was his first public comment on the fires, blamed the state’s poor ""forest management"" for the infernos and threatened to withhold federal funding.  Biden’s ad includes images of California burning and the head of the state’s largest firefighters union calling Trump’s statement ""idiotic.""   ""Firefighters say the tweet contained so much misinformation, they had to speak out,"" the ad claims.  Is Biden’s ad right? Did California firefighters, beyond the union president, really criticize Trump during the wildfires? We set out on a fact check.    The Camp Fire rages through Paradise, Calif., on Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018. Noah Berger / AP Photo Background on the fires The ad references Northern California’s Camp Fire and Southern California’s Woolsey Fire, both of which broke out in November 2018.  The Camp Fire killed 86 people in Butte County and destroyed nearly 19,000 structures, including 14,000 homes, making it the state’s most deadly and destructive wildfire in history. The Woolsey Fire killed three people and destroyed more than 1,600 structures.  Here’s Trump’s tweet from Nov. 10, 2018:  Shortly after, PolitiFact California fact-checked Trump’s claim that forest management is the sole reason for the fires. We rated it False.  Forestry and climate experts told us stronger winds, higher temperatures and drier conditions driven by climate change are also making California’s fires worse. They said forest management is one factor, but not necessarily the driving force.  In another tweet two days later, Trump thanked California’s firefighters and first responders. He also approved California's request for a major disaster declaration, freeing up federal aid for fire response and recovery. Criticism from firefighters The most vocal fire leader to criticize Trump was Brian Rice, president of the California Professional Firefighters. Rice is shown in the Biden ad saying ""That statement was idiodic,"" referring to Trump’s tweet. The comments were lifted from an interview Rice did with a San Francisco TV news station. In the full interview, he added: ""It was ill timed. And it’s ignorant. It’s a statement of an ignorant man. … I love my country. I am proud to be an American. But I am disgusted with my president.""  In an interview this week, Rice called Biden's ad ""fair and accurate."" A union spokesperson said Rice ""clearly spoke out,"" citing a formal statement he issued at the time. ""The statement pretty clearly indicates that Mr. Rice believes Mr. Trump’s tweet was misinformed,"" he said. Rice said his chapter fully supports the decision of its national union to endorse Biden’s 2020 presidential bid. The International Association of Fire Fighters announced its support for Biden in April.  Biden is in a virtual tie with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren among likely voters in California’s Democratic primary, according to a Real Clear Politics average of polls.    A spokesperson for Biden’s campaign attributed all of the ad’s statements, including the claim that firefighters spoke out against the president, to news coverage. The claim in question, that ""Firefighters say the tweet contained so much misinformation, they had to speak out,"" comes directly from a TV reporter narrating a news story.  We found Rice wasn’t the only fire leader to criticize Trump’s words.  The Biden ad includes a brief clip of Los Angeles Fire Chief Daryl Osby, pulled from a separate TV interview. In it, he says the state is ""in extreme climate change right now."" That by itself isn’t a biting critique. But Osby goes on to say in his full interview: ""I personally find that statement unsatisfactory … It’s very hurtful for all first responders that are putting their lives on the line to protect lives and property.""  Tom O’Connor, president of the San Francisco Fire Local 798, also criticized Trump’s tweet, telling a TV station after asked about the tweet that, ""Now is not the time for politics. It’s a time for leadership. It’s not the ‘red and blue states of America.’ It’s the United States of America.""  Finally, Scott Austin, president of the Pasadena Firefighters Association said in a tweet: ""Mr. President, with all due respect, you are wrong.  The fires in So. Cal are urban interface fires and have NOTHING to do with forest management. Come to SoCal and learn the facts & help the victims. Scott Austin, Pres IAFF 809."" The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.  Our ruling Former vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden attacked President Trump in a recent campaign ad over his comments last year on California’s deadly wildfires. The Biden ad claimed California firefighters ""spoke out"" against the president over a controversial tweet he made as the fires raged. The tweet included a threat to withhold federal funds.   The ad shows two fire leaders, including the president of the state’s largest firefighter union, speaking out when asked about Trump’s statements. Full interviews with those leaders show they went on to make even stronger critiques of Trump. Additional news reports show other top fire leaders calling out the president’s tweet as misinformed and an inappropriate use of politics during a time of crisis.  This backs up the main assertion about firefighters speaking out",True,"December 18, 2019"
"""Roughly one in four fish eaten in the United States was caught here and sent to Asia for processing before being re-imported for American consumers.""","The first quick-fire question Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon put to Elizabeth Warren Dec. 5 was, ""What is the most important issue facing American voters today?"" ""Corruption,"" Warren fired back. That fits well with her campaign message that big corporations and the uber-rich have wormed their way into the corridors of power in Washington. But Warren has another bit of fishy business on her mind. In a Dec. 10 policy brief, she laid out plans to leverage the power of the oceans to fight climate change and boost jobs in the fishing industry. Among her points, Warren said America had offshored too much of the fish processing business. ""We must also rebuild the necessary infrastructure to once again support vibrant coastal communities and a local seafood economy,"" Warren said. ""Today, roughly one in four fish eaten in the United States was caught here and sent to Asia for processing before being re-imported for American consumers. By building processing plants in the United States, we can not only decrease the carbon footprint of the seafood industry, but we can also create a new class of jobs in the Blue Economy."" Dare we say, that 1-in-4 statistic had us hooked. We got in touch with the fishery researchers who wrote the paper Warren used to support her assertion. They said they didn’t offer that stat, and while they don’t have an exact estimate, her figure is probably too high. Should Warren throw this one back? Let’s break it down. Off Alaska, up in the Bering Sea and the Aleutian Islands, trawlers bring in over 1.3 million metric tons of Alaska pollock, a versatile white fish. The catch is huge, amounting to a third of America’s total seafood output. Measured in sales, about a quarter of the catch stays in the United States and shows up on grocery shelves as everything from filets to breaded fish sticks to imitation crab meat. China buys about 14% of the catch. And some of that comes back to the United States. ""Fish is processed in places like China because the costs of processing are cheaper than they are in the United States,"" said former U.S. Agriculture Department chief economist Joseph Glauber. As much as $900 million worth of pollock and other seafood is caught in U.S. waters, processed in China and sold here as filets and fish sticks. The general pattern repeats for pink salmon. It’s caught in Alaska, sent to countries  such as China or Thailand, and comes back as salmon burgers or perhaps salmon in a can. Other species of fish, to a lesser extent, also make this global round trip. Warren said that about one out of four fish Americans eat are part of this cycle, citing a National Academy of Sciences paper from a multi-university research team. But you won’t find Warren’s stat in that article, because the article tackled a different question. The authors wanted to debunk a talking point that only 10% of the seafood Americans eat is domestically produced. (This is a popular talking point among some top U.S. officials.) The researchers wrote that a better estimate of the fish caught and eaten here would be about 35% to 38%. Warren’s staff told us they took the difference between 10% and 35%, got 25% and used that to come up with the statistic that 1-in-4 fish was caught here, sent overseas, and re-imported. ""That would not be the correct approach,"" said co-author Jessica Gephart at American University. ""The 10% was not a solid number to begin with."" In other words, the article did not take the 10% as given, and then add in the re-imported fish. It was a complete reworking of all the numbers. Martin Smith, professor of environmental economics at Duke University, offered support for the topline results of Gephart and her colleagues for domestic-origin consumption. He reached a similar percentage based on the 10-most commonly eaten fish in the United States. ""So, that’s a totally different methodology that gets to a similar number,"" Smith said. All researchers agree that there’s a severe lack of good data, and estimates will vary. And what Warren described is a real issue. But the actual number of fish caught here, processed in Asia, and then sold here, Gephart said, is likely ""significantly less"" than one out of four. Warren said one out of four fish caught in the United States is processed in Asia and then eaten here. That relies on a misreading of a research article that aimed to debunk a widely used statistic. One of the co-authors said Warren’s statistic was significantly too high and the method her staff used to derive it was not correct. The issue of domestic seafood being processed overseas is large, but experts said it is not as large as Warren said",Mostly False,"December 13, 2019"
"""In Bakersfield, where there’s a lot of oil drilling going on, there’s more solar jobs now in Bakersfield and around that area than there are oil jobs.""","Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger likes to boast about his home state’s move to clean energy sources such as wind and solar.  But on Sunday’s Meet the Press on NBC, the GOP politician and climate activist may have gone too far.  Schwarzenegger was on the show promoting World War Zero, a coalition of scientists, politicians and celebrities hoping to bring greater urgency to climate change, ahead of the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference.  He said California’s embrace of renewables is evident even in Bakersfield, a city of 380,000 better known for oil derricks and country music than solar arrays and wind turbines.  ""I just want to tell you that, for instance, in California, in Bakersfield, where there’s a lot of oil drilling going on, there’s more solar jobs now in Bakersfield and around that area than there are oil jobs,"" Schwarzenegger claimed. ""People are leaving the oil fields and going to work in solar and clean energy and stuff like that.""  More solar jobs than oil jobs in the Bakersfield area?  We drilled down on a fact check.  Our research  Our reporting, along with a fact check by Bakersfield NBC TV affiliate KGET, calls Schwarzenegger’s specific claim into question. But it also shows renewable energy jobs are growing in the region.  Asked about the claim solar jobs have overtaken oil positions, Kern County spokesperson Megan Person told the station ""we know that not to be true.""  She said the county is home to approximately 2,500 solar jobs, most of which are temporary and tied to construction and installation.  By comparison, it has about 14,000 jobs directly connected to the oil and gas industry, most of which Person said are permanent oil jobs. She said the figures come from private service JobsEQ.  It’s the same amount listed in a 2017 Oil and Gas in California report by the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation.  Bakersfield is the largest city in Kern County, located south of Fresno and north of Los Angeles. The region, like much of the state, has seen a jump in renewables, but not to a level matching traditional energy jobs.   ""Kern County is seeing a rise in solar installations, and I don’t mean just residential. I mean giant commercial projects,"" Person said, citing a new solar field that will generate 850 solar construction jobs.  ""It could be confusion related to that,"" she continued. ""I don’t know where [Schwarzenegger’s] numbers came from. We can’t substantiate them."" 'It was a mistake'  The former governor’s spokesperson, Daniel Ketchell, told PolitiFact California that Schwarzenegger ""meant to say new jobs. What he said was not meant to mislead. It was a mistake.""  Ketchell clarified that he intended to say the San Joaquin Valley has gained more new clean energy jobs than oil jobs. There’s some evidence for that, but it’s a far different claim than what the governor said on TV. The Valley includes a much bigger area, running from Stockton to Bakersfield, and clean energy goes beyond just solar.  ""Yes, it’s on the rise,"" Carol Zabin, director of the Green Economy Program at the UC Berkeley Labor Center, said of solar and other clean energy sources. ""The big solar farms are located in various parts of the state. But there’s a concentration in the San Joaquin Valley."" Zabin said the Center does not have figures comparing solar and oil jobs in the Bakersfield area. But in a 2017 study, it reported that California’s clean energy initiatives ""created 88,000 total jobs, including 31,000 direct jobs"" in the San Joaquin Valley from 2002 to 2015.  She added that automation has led to a decrease in some oil and gas jobs in the Valley, though she noted demand for fossil fuels continues to be strong.  Our ruling  Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger recently claimed there are more solar jobs than oil jobs in the Bakersfield area.  A spokesperson for Kern County said the area’s solar jobs amount to just 2,500 while the oil and gas industry includes 14,000 positions.  Schwarzenegger’s spokesman told us he meant to say the San Joaquin Valley is seeing more new clean energy jobs than oil jobs.

A new attack on the climate change measure and its supporters connects it to abortion. Republican Nikki Haley, the former United Nations ambassador under President Donald Trump and former South Carolina governor sent an email Oct. 26 from Stand for America, a policy group she launched in February. The email says the following: ""Liberals continue to go around the country touting their radical climate change agenda. ""Front and center was their ‘Green New Deal.’ Or as we at Stand For America have come to call it, the ‘Green New Scam.’ The candidates touted everything from putting limits on red meat consumption, to promoting abortion in third world countries to control the population! ""We must stand up to these liberals, and let them know that we don’t support this radical agenda!"" The email then links to a petition that seeks to stop the Green New Deal, saying it would ""promote abortion."" Broadly, the Green New Deal is a resolution first proposed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., that would address ways to curb climate change and protect the environment, with measures on emissions, water, infrastructure and scientific research.  The words abortion and population are not mentioned in the text of the Green New Deal resolution. With regard to other countries, the resolution says only that the Green New Deal would promote ""the international exchange of technology, expertise, products, funding and services, with the aim of making the United States the international leader on climate action, and to help other countries achieve a Green New Deal."" So what is Haley talking about? We repeatedly emailed, called and messaged Stand for America, and we reached out to the publisher of Haley’s forthcoming book. But we did not receive any replies to our requests for information to support Haley’s statement. Haley’s email about ""the candidates"" pushing red meat and abortion agenda does not specify which candidates she alluded to. But conservatives accused 2020 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders of wanting to use abortion for population control in order to fight climate change, based on his answer to a question at a Sept. 4 CNN town hall  focused on climate change.  Here was his exchange with an audience member (in which neither mentioned the Green New Deal): Question: ""Human population growth has more than doubled in the past 50 years. The planet cannot sustain this growth. I realize this is a poisonous topic for politicians, but it's crucial to face. Empowering women and educating everyone on the need to curb population growth seems a reasonable campaign to enact. Would you be courageous enough to discuss this issue and make it a key feature of a plan to address climate catastrophe?"" Sanders: ""Well, Martha, the answer is yes. And the answer has everything to do with the fact that women in the United States of America, by the way, have a right to control their own bodies and make reproductive decisions. And the Mexico City agreement, which denies American aid to those organizations around the world that allow women to have abortions or even get involved in birth control to me is totally absurd."" The agreement prohibits U.S. foreign aid not just directly for abortions, but for any organization that provides abortion or abortion-related services. It was rescinded under President Barack Obama and reactivated by Trump. Among the critics was U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., who tweeted, ""Bernie Sanders said YOUR tax dollars should be used to fund abortions in foreign countries to reduce population size."" Sanders did say population control should be part of addressing climate change. And he brought up the Mexico City agreement and said women should have the right to ""reproductive decisions."" But he did not explicitly promote the use of abortion for population control. Haley said in an email that targets defeat of the Green New Deal that candidates who are supporting the proposal are ""promoting abortion in third world countries to control the population!"" The email distorts the Green New Deal resolution by linking it to abortion. (The linked petition is even more direct.)

Say Sen. Lindsey Graham supports the Green New Deal.,"A tiny progressive advocacy PAC with less than $500 on hand bought an ad on Facebook as a media stunt. The Really Online Lefty League’s ad falsely showed Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., endorsing the broad climate change policy known as the Green New Deal. The Green New Deal calls for pretty much the entire country to mobilize and bring the United States to net-zero emissions by 2050 –– the point where it adds no more carbon to the atmosphere than is captured. Government action would be massive. Graham, a firm conservative, has railed against the idea. But in the ad, he says, ""We believe in the Green New Deal."" The man behind the ad, Adriel Hampton, a communications strategist in San Francisco, said he got the idea from a House hearing when Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., pressed Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. ""Could I run ads targeting Republicans in primaries saying that they voted for the Green New Deal?"" Ocasio-Cortez asked. Zuckerberg said, ""Probably."" Here’s what viewers of the ad see and hear, and then, we provide what Graham actually said.  The ad’s headline is ""Conservatives for a Green New Deal,"" and it displays in a corner throughout the minute-and-a-half long ad. It begins with video of Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon talking about the need to protect the environment. Nixon oversaw the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency and major amendments to both the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, two pillars of American environmental legislation. The ad then shifts to a news conference with Graham at the podium. ""I’m Sen. Graham of South Carolina,"" Graham says. ""I’m here to announce with my colleagues that we care about conservation.""  Graham’s voice continues as images of wind turbines and pine branches gently swaying in the breeze fill the screen.  ""We care about the environment,"" Graham continues. ""From a Republican point of view, I think we need to look at the science, admit that climate change is real. Simply put, we believe in the Green New Deal."" For good measure, the ad shows a picture with Graham and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a prime author of the Green New Deal, shoulder to shoulder at a rally, arms raised in victory. The photo of Graham and Ocasio-Cortez is faked, as is his stated support for the Green New Deal  The original photo was of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, taken in 2018. Graham’s head replaced Sanders’. The audio editing of Graham’s news conference was masked by cutting away from the video of the event to add new images. Here are key excerpts from Graham’s event. ""From a Republican point of view I think we need to showcase that we care about conservation –– we care about the environment,"" Graham said. And then he went on: ""We have innovative solutions that are not top-down regulatory solutions,"" he said. ""We believe that you cannot have a healthy environment and destroy the economy and we believe that our friends on the other side care about the environment, but they care so much, they're going to destroy the economy."" Graham did say, ""When nine out of ten scientists say that CO2 admissions are creating a greenhouse gas effect, that the planet is warming up, I believe the nine not the tenth."" He did say ""look at the science, admit that climate change is real,"" but here’s what he said about the Green New Deal. ""There's not one Republican going to vote for anything coming out of the Green New Deal ‘cause it’s  crazy.""

Says a photo shows Greta Thunberg posing next to George Soros and with ISIS.,"On social media, some users are sharing misinformation about the 16-year-old activist who inspired the worldwide climate strike Sept. 20. One post, which was published on Facebook on Sept. 23, claims to include three photos of Greta Thunberg. It purports to show the Swedish teenager posing with an Islamic State member, philanthropist George Soros and an Antifa shirt. ""Well well well … do I need to explain anymore?"" reads text above the images, followed by the hashtags, ""#AnonsKnew #GretaThunberg #DeepStatePuppet."" A Facebook user who shared the post wrote next to the image, ""This is Typical Twisted Lies and Deceit, the Stupid Left Believes these Idiots!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) And versions of it have been shared hundreds of times, so we wanted to see if the photos are real.   Based on our analysis, only one of the photos in the Facebook post is authentic — the other two are doctored or taken out of context. And the caption over the real one, which shows Thunberg wearing an antifascist shirt, isn’t accurate. The first image in the flagged post is a screenshot of another post from a Facebook user. It claims to show Thunberg posing with a bearded member of the Islamic State, the man’s arm around her shoulder as he speaks into a microphone. But the photo is not of Thunberg. A reverse image search reveals that the image is six years old and was taken from a video made during an ISIS-led Quran recitation competition in Aleppo, Syria, according to a news caption, as we noted in a previous fact check. The photo was published in a now-defunct article on an Iranian website in August 2014. And The Morocco World News reported around the same time that the girl in the video was 7 years old, tearful over mistakes she made in her recitation. While the child looks vaguely similar to Thunberg — who would have been 10 at the time — there’s no evidence that it’s her. The second image in the flagged Facebook post purports to show Thunberg posing next to Soros, a philanthropist and Democratic donor who is often the target of conservative attacks. But we found that the photo was digitally altered to make it look like Thunberg is chummy with the wealthy liberal financier. The original image actually shows Thunberg posing with former Vice President Al Gore in December. Thank you @algore for being a true pioneer. Very few people have done more. It was an honour to meet you. #climatecrisis #climatebreakdown pic.twitter.com/HzbvPcGkwu The altered version of the image appears to have been created by a French parody outlet in late August. The final photo in the suspect Facebook post shows Thunberg sitting on a couch while wearing a shirt that says ""antifascist all stars."" Text written over the image claims that the activist ""aligns herself with the Antifa terrorist organization."" Antifa is a loosely-affiliated group of left-wing activists whose mission is to counter the ideology of fascism. It has drawn criticism for its members’ willingness to use violence against far-right groups. The photo of Thunberg is real. On July 26, she tweeted that she had deleted a photo of herself wearing the shirt after learning that it could be linked to ""a violent movement."" However, in the same tweet, she said the shirt was borrowed. Yesterday I posted a photo wearing a borrowed T-shirt that says I’m against fascism. That T-shirt can apparently to some be linked to a violent movement. I don’t support any form of violence and to avoid misunderstandings I’ve deleted the post. And of course I am against fascism. We could find no evidence that Thunberg has participated in Antifa demonstrations. And being antifascist does not necessarily mean one supports the left-wing group Antifa. What’s more, the Facebook post’s claim that Antifa is a terrorist organization is dubious.

"The Green New Deal ""would put a $600,000 tax burden on every household.""","Critics of the Green New Deal have circulated numerous false claims about the resolution — saying it would do everything from ban farting cows to eliminate air travel. Now the Republican Party of Florida is repeating a familiar talking point that the Green New Deal would create a scary pricetag. ""Democrats are proposing a radical $93 trillion Green New Deal which has been condemned by unions as a job killer and would put a $600,000 tax burden on every household,"" the Florida GOP tweeted Sept. 20. We previously fact-checked a claim that included the $93 trillion figure and rated it False. (President Donald Trump rounds up the claim to $100 trillion.) Here we will explain why the $600,000 figure is misleading, too. We found there is no government analysis of the cost of the Green New Deal per household. This is in part because the Green New Deal expresses goals; it doesn’t lay out specific policies. The $600,000 figure is based on adding up estimates in a report from a right-of-center group that cautioned it was an ""initial foray."" But the GOP talking point exaggerates and oversimplifies the analysis so much that the $600,000 figure can’t be considered accurate. The Green New Deal is a House resolution that U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, introduced in February.  Resolutions are not actual, detailed legislation in themselves. In this case, the Green New Deal resolution in the House — and its companion measure that was introduced in the Senate — address broad principles to curb climate change and protect the environment. The resolutions extend into other domestic policy areas, as well, including jobs and health care.  But the proposal doesn’t lay out any cost figures, and it has not received a cost estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The House resolution was forwarded to several committees and subcommittees for further review. The Republican-led Senate, meanwhile, voted down the measure in March after it was introduced by Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and co-sponsored by many Senate Democrats running for president. The Florida GOP did not respond to our questions about the source of their evidence, but conservative news outlets have cited the $600,000 figure from a February report by the American Action Forum, a right-of-center think tank. The American Action Forum is a sister organization of the American Action Network, a conservative advocacy organization. The American Action Forum acknowledged the difficulty in coming up with a number for the cost, saying that ""the breadth of its proposals makes it daunting to assess"" and that many of the proposed policies are redundant, ""which also complicates a precise analysis."" The report doesn’t mention the $600,000 figure or a total for the estimated per-household cost. However, it does show the estimated per-household cost for different parts of the Green New Deal, some of which were expressed in ranges. The Florida GOP’s tweet said that the Green New Deal  ""would put a $600,000 tax burden on every household"" -- which could suggest a massive tax increase for every family. But the American Action Forum analysis doesn’t actually say that every household will pay that cost in new taxes. And the costs identified in the analysis are spread over about a decade, from 2020 to 2029. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum and a former head of the Congressional Budget Office, told PolitiFact that he stands by the analysis. ""We never actually added it up,"" he said. ""We tried to get the order of magnitude, what are we looking at here? That was the intent of that first piece."" If we add up the high-end range in each category, that adds up to $671,010 between 2020 and 2029. If we added up the low-end range in each category, it adds up to $369,010.  To come up with estimates, the American Action Forum made a series of assumptions, such as that the Green New Deal would lead to enough high-speed rail transit available that air travel becomes unnecessary. The actual text of the resolution does not call for grounding airplanes. (A much-panned FAQ document written by Ocasio-Cortez’s staff said ""we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast."" But a staff-written FAQ carries zero weight legislatively.) The American Action Forum analysis also factored in costs for Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All. However, the text of the Senate resolution itself doesn’t include a statement on Medicare for All -- instead, it more broadly calls for ""high-quality health care."" (At least some of the resolution co-sponsors do support separate legislation Medicare for All however.) Holtz-Eakin said he had hoped more specifics would emerge from proponents allowing a more specific cost analysis, but that hasn’t happened, he said. The Florida GOP tweeted that the Green New Deal ""would put a $600,000 tax burden on every household."" The Green New Deal is a set of goals; it does not impose specific taxes. Instead, the $600,000 number comes from a brief that its author, the right-of-center American Action Forum, acknowledges is a preliminary and rough estimate. The analysis did not say that every household would pay an extra $600,000 in taxes. Instead, it estimated what costs might be under a range of scenarios over a period of 10 years.  It’s possible the resolution will eventually lead to legislation that can be formally analyzed for potential costs, but at this point, such costs can’t be determined",False,"September 27, 2019"

"Says she ""sued Exxon Mobil"" as California attorney general.","During a climate town hall on CNN this week, Democratic presidential candidate and California Sen.

In answer to a direct question, she claimed she already did that as California’s attorney general.  ""So, Senator Harris, what would you do? Would you sue them? Sue Exxon Mobil?"" asked moderator Erin Burnett. ""I have sued Exxon Mobil,"" Harris replied.  Did she?  Environmental groups questioned her response.  We decided to fact check it.   Our research We found Harris’ office investigated Exxon in 2016 over allegations it lied to the public and its shareholders about the risk to its business from climate change. The Los Angeles Times detailed that probe in a January 2016 news article. It said Exxon rejected the allegations.   But there’s no public record, and nothing that Harris’ campaign could provide, to show she filed a lawsuit against the company.  ""The facts are Harris opened an investigation against Exxon for lying about climate change. She didn’t take that further even though she should have and other attorney generals did,"" said Kassie Siegel, climate director at the Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund. ""She did bring some cases against oil companies. I’m not aware of a case that she actually brought against Exxon. And she didn’t bring the case against Exxon for lying about climate change.""  Ian Sams, a campaign spokesman for Harris, told us she ""launched an investigation into Exxon,"" but he would not directly address her claim that she sued the company.  He told The New York Times that, ""as attorney general (Harris) sued Chevron, BP, ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66 for pollution activities, helping win $50 million in settlements."" Sams provided PolitiFact California with links to articles and news releases supporting those actions.  In their own fact checks, the Times and CNN reported they found no evidence supporting Harris’ claim that she sued Exxon.  ""As Cal AG, Harris opened a file shortly after the #ExxonKnew news broke in fall 2015. She never did anything with it,"" RL Miller, chair of the California Democratic Party's environmental caucus and president of the Climate Hawks Vote Super PAC, said on Twitter during the town hall. Our rating Sen. Kamala Harris claimed at a recent climate town hall that she ""sued Exxon Mobil"" as California attorney general.  She opened an investigation into the oil giant over allegations it was lying to the public and its shareholders about climate change. But there’s no public evidence, or any from her campaign, that she ever filed a lawsuit against the company.  Harris did sue other oil companies and win settlements over allegations they violated various state laws governing hazardous materials, according to information provided by her campaign.

"""70% of the pollution of the carbon that we're throwing into the air comes from three industries.""","Near the end of her turn on CNN’s climate change town-hall-a-thon, host Chris Cuomo asked Sen. Elizabeth Warren about lightbulbs. Specifically, if the government should be telling people the kind of lightbulbs they can have. The Democratic presidential candidate cast the issue as a diversion from the real task at hand. ""This is exactly what the fossil fuel industry hopes we're all talking about,"" Warren said. ""They want to be able to stir up a lot of controversy around your lightbulbs, straws and cheeseburgers, when 70% of the pollution of the carbon that we're throwing into the air comes from three industries."" After the town hall, Warren repeated the 70% statistic on Instagram.   The fossil fuel industry wants to keep us arguing about light bulbs and cheeseburgers while 70% of pollution comes from just three industries. We need to focus on creating big, structural change to tackle this climate crisis and the Washington corruption head-on. #ClimateTownHall A post shared by  Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethwarren) on Sep 4, 2019 at 8:20pm PDT We wondered which three industries the Democratic presidential candidate had in mind. Warren’s campaign directed us to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The agency’s page on the sources of greenhouse gas emissions shows that three sectors —transportation, electricity production and industry — account for 78% of the American total. But those are activities, not industries in themselves. Transportation, the biggest of the three, includes the cars people drive and the flights they take for business and pleasure. ""It is strange, obviously, to say ‘three industries’ with one of them being ‘industry,’"" said the co-director of MIT’s Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change John Reilly. The focus on industry, Reilly said, shifts attention away from the broader ways that energy consumption is woven into the fabric of American life.  ""This may lead to the implication that the cost of reducing these emissions will fall on industry,"" he said. ""To the extent that myth is perpetuated, that is a problem. One way or another, we will all bear the cost of doing things differently.""  The climate researchers we reached said Warren’s term was off the mark. Where they differed was on the significance. In contrast to Reilly, Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said he didn’t find it to be a major issue. As it turns out, Warren has used the 70% figure in a couple of ways that are more accurate, without saying ""industries."" Earlier during the town hall, Warren said she wanted to focus on ""the three areas where we get the most carbon pollution in America right now."" ""They're in our buildings and homes, right? What we're burning. It's our cars and light-duty trucks that we drive. And it's the generation of electricity where we're still using a lot of carbon-based fuel to make that happen.""  Eliminating the carbon footprint in all three by 2035 would, she said, ""cut 70% of the carbon that we are currently spewing into the air."" That’s a slightly different mix of sources, and based on the EPA numbers, they add up to the reduction Warren claimed. In her $1 trillion clean energy plan that Warren posted a day before the town hall, she was fully accurate.  ""Electricity, transportation, buildings, and related commercial activity are responsible for nearly 70% of all U.S. carbon emissions,"" she wrote. Warren said that three industries account for 70% of the carbon that goes into the air. That’s imprecise. It is accurate to say that transportation, producing electricity and industry writ large are the three largest sources of greenhouse gases and represent more than 70% of the problem. But those are activities, not industries. Individual Americans as well as companies contribute to the situation in ways that are often intertwined. Warren herself has been more accurate in her energy plan and even during the town hall itself. But she pushed the focus on industry on social media, and climate change researchers say that word doesn’t fit with the 70% figure she used",Half True,"September 6, 2019"

"""Most climate scientists agree that we only have less than a decade to turn things around or else we’ll be stuck with a 'worst case scenario' including rising sea levels, devastating droughts, and worsening famines.""","In a recent campaign email, U.S. Rep. Sean Casten repeated a talking point often used by Democrats about how little time remains to turn the tide on climate change. ""Most climate scientists agree that we only have less than a decade to turn things around or else we’ll be stuck with a 'worst case scenario' including rising sea levels, devastating droughts, and worsening famines,"" read the email, which was attributed to Casten. Casten, a former clean-energy entrepreneur who flipped Illinois’ west suburban 6th Congressional District for the Democrats in 2018, isn’t the first politician to contend the planet faces a hard deadline on climate change. Prominent Democrats, including presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, made similar claims earlier this year that were contradicted by scientists in fact-checks by The Associated Press and CNN. Casten’s claim and others like it trace back to a 2018 report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). That report said nations must take ""unprecedented"" actions to reduce emissions, which will need to be on a significantly different trajectory by 2030 in order to avoid more severe impacts from increased warming. However, it did not identify the hard deadline Casten and others have suggested. In part, that’s because serious effects from climate change have already begun. The panel predicted that if warming continues at its current rate global temperatures are likely to reach 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels between 2030 and 2052. If temperatures exceed 1.5 degrees, the report cautioned, the planet will face greater disruptions, some of which ""may be long-lasting or irreversible."" To keep temperatures from rising above that temperature, the report stated with high confidence that carbon dioxide emissions would need to start dropping ""well before 2030"" and be on a path to fall by nearly half by 2030. Following the report’s release last October, a popular narrative began to emerge that there were only 12 years left to act in order to avoid the most extreme consequences of climate change. But experts say that conclusion overstates the report’s findings, which drew on the work of hundreds of scientists. James Skea, co-chairman of the IPCC report and a sustainable energy professor at Imperial College London, told The Associated Press in March that the panel ""did not say we have 12 years left to save the world."" We followed up with Skea, who confirmed the panel has not published any work since then that supports the hard deadline Casten suggested. In response to our inquiry, a spokesperson for Casten’s campaign sent us several sources, two of which focused on the IPCC report. One of them, a recent article from InsideClimate News, explained the timeline for reducing emissions laid out by the IPCC does not mean 2030 is the threshold for climate disaster. Framing it as a hard deadline is ""more of a messaging tool than a physical science reality,"" said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research’s Center for Climate and Weather Extremes, who was quoted in the piece. ""The next decade is indeed a critical window in which to achieve enough technological, economic and policy momentum toward a carbon-neutral world while minimizing societal disruption,"" he told us. ""But on the other hand there's no geophysical cliff at the end of the decade that makes all our efforts moot if we don't make it all the way."" Duke University climate researcher Drew Shindell, a lead author of the IPCC report’s chapter on mitigation, told us the panel indeed found that ""if we are not on a greatly different path by 2030 than our current trajectory we cannot keep within the 1.5 [degree Celsius] warming target."" ""But we won't necessarily face a 'worst-case scenario' if we don't act in less than a decade as acting during the 2030’s is still better than waiting until say the 2040’s, so there's always an even worse case,"" he said. Shindell and others also pointed out that serious effects of global warming, including rising sea levels and worsening droughts, are challenges we already face today and will continue to grow regardless. Casten said that ""most climate scientists agree that we only have less than a decade to turn things around or else we’ll be stuck with a ‘worst case scenario’ including rising sea levels, devastating droughts, and worsening famines."" A 2018 UN climate report determined a significant decrease in carbon emissions by 2030 is necessary in order to keep global temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels in years to come, and to mitigate even more severe effects of a warming planet. Experts told us action taken to decrease emissions in the next decade will be critical. However, they said it’s an oversimplification to suggest we face a hard deadline of a decade to address climate change before crossing a threshold into climate disaster",Mostly True,"September 1, 2019"
"""Trump is as destructive a person in this century as Hitler, Stalin, and Mao were in the last century. He may be responsible for many more million deaths than they were.""","Does President Donald Trump rank alongside the 20th century’s bloodiest dictators? A prominent psychiatrist said so during an interview on CNN. Allen James Frances, the chairman emeritus of Duke University’s department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, appeared on CNN’s ""Reliable Sources,"" a program hosted by Brian Stelter that analyzes the news media.  Frances – who played a key role in the publication of the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the reference work that defines recognized psychiatric conditions – was brought on the show to discuss how the media should cover those who question Trump’s mental fitness for office. Frances warned against ""medicalizing politics,"" but he expressed concern about Trump: ""Trump is as destructive a person in this century as Hitler, Stalin, and Mao were in the last century. He may be responsible for many more million deaths than they were. He needs to be contained, but he needs to be contained by attacking his policies, not his person."" After some Twitter users attacked Frances for comparing Trump to Adolf Hitler of Germany, Josef Stalin of the Soviet Union, and Mao Zedong of China – and criticized Stelter for allowing Frances’ comment to go unchallenged – Stelter took responsibility, citing technical difficulties that had distracted him during Frances’ comment. Frances also elaborated on Twitter, saying he was referring to the future death toll from climate change, hastened by Trump’s policies: ""Terrible damage Trump is doing to world climate at this global warming tipping point may be irreversable/could kill hundreds of millions of people in the coming decades. Many of them our children & grandchildren & their children. This is an existential crisis for humanity."" We decided to take a closer look at Frances’ original comment. In interviews with PolitiFact, historians of the 20th century and experts on climate change both agreed that Frances made an extraordinarily flawed comparison to put Trump in the company of Hitler, Stalin, and Mao. ""Much as I abhor Trump’s climate policies, calling him Hitler seems inappropriate to me,"" said Rob Jackson, a Stanford University professor of earth system science. ""Trump’s climate and environmental policies are destructive. Calling him Hitler, though, is a distraction. It helps him marginalize criticism."" ""Frances’s statement is shockingly stupid and uninformed for someone with a respectable and responsible position,"" said Benjamin Hett, a historian at Hunter College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and author of ""The Death of Democracy: Hitler’s Rise to Power and the Downfall of the Weimar Republic."" Frances did not respond to inquiries for this article. A spokesman for Duke said that Frances is retired from the university and has no current responsibilities.  The death toll for each of the three 20th century dictators is subject to some disagreement and  margin of error, but authoritative accountings suggest that each was responsible for the deaths of at least 10 million or more. Yale University historian Timothy Snyder estimated in 2011 that Hitler caused between 11 million and 12 million deaths of noncombatants, and that Stalin caused a similar number if you include deaths from disease and famine.  Meanwhile, one calculation by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum estimated more than 17 million deaths caused by Hitler. Combat deaths from World War II, would push the number higher still. (Since Hitler and Stalin faced off in World War II, there’s a risk of double-counting in such calculations.) Mao, for his part, may have exceeded them both. Ian Johnson, the author of ""The Souls of China: The Return of Religion After Mao,"" estimated in 2018 that Mao was responsible for perhaps 42.5 million deaths, of which the largest number came from a preventable famine stemming from his Great Leap Forward policy. A 2014 World Health Organization analysis found that ""climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year between 2030 and 2050,"" from such varied causes as heat exposure to the elderly, diarrhea, malaria, and malnutrition. Using the 250,000-a-year figure, it would take about 40 years of Trump-related deaths from climate change to meet the low end of the Hitler and Stalin death counts. To reach Mao’s death toll of 42.5 million, it would take 170 years.  In early 2019, Andy Haines and Kristie Ebi, environmental and health specialists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, called the WHO calculation ""a conservative estimate"" in a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine. But even if the WHO estimate is low, it’s clear that you’d have to stick Trump with the blame for many decades worth of global deaths from climate change to compete with Hitler, Stalin or Mao. Even experts who decry Trump’s climate policies note that any future deaths will not be solely attributable to him.  The process has been underway long before Trump entered the Oval Office. In addition, countless other factors – from corporate policies to individuals’ own actions – have brought us to where we are today.  ""When Trump took office, we were already committed to the ocean and atmospheric warming that we are seeing now, the basically irreversible acceleration in polar ice melt we are seeing now, the accelerating melt of permafrost and its effects we are seeing now, and the accelerating sea level rise we are seeing now,"" said Harold R. Wanless, a professor of geography and regional studies at the University of Miami. Given this, Wanless said, the blame should be shared with all preceding administrations and congresses since about 1979, ""when it became apparent that climate change was happening, was starting to produce these changes, was basically irreversible, and would be made worse and worse as we added more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.""  Wanless termed Frances’ comparison ""naïve, irresponsible, and purely political."" Peter Fritzsche, a University of Illinois historian, told PolitiFact that ""it seems silly to find a single embodiment to the problem of climate change,"" he said. ""Trump is a poster boy of ignorance, but the problem is much much larger, more serious, more difficult."" Fritzsche suggested a different comparison – presidents such as Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan whose inaction made the Civil War inevitable. ""I would compare Trump to the weak presidents of the 1850s who completely failed to see -- purposefully -- the conflict between North and South, the expansion of slavery in the West, and the issue of fugitive slaves,"" he said. Frances said, ""Trump is as destructive a person in this century as Hitler, Stalin, and Mao were in the last century. He may be responsible for many more million deaths than they were."" Not only does Frances’ comparison exaggerate the predicted climate change death toll compared to that of the dictators, he also lays the blame for potential future deaths at Trump’s feet alone, which even experts critical of Trump consider wrongheaded",False Pants on Fire,"August 26, 2019"
Says that ice melting in a cup illustrates that sea levels don’t rise when icebergs melt.,"Widespread, historic melting across Greenland’s ice sheet this summer has caused alarm. The Washington Post reported that Greenland has lost more than 250 billion tons of ice — enough to fill more than 90 million Olympic-size swimming pools.   On July 31, the Post reported that the recent heat wave caused ""one of the biggest melt events ever observed on the fragile ice sheet.""  But an image posted to Facebook that same day casts doubt on how icebergs affect sea level rise.  The post, which had been shared more than 4,700 times by Aug. 9, shows two photos. The first photo is of a measuring cup filled with water and ice. An arrow pointing to the ice says ""ice berg"" and an arrow pointing to the water says ""ocean."" The second photo is similar except there is no ice. An arrow pointing to where the ice was says ""ice berg melts,"" an arrow pointing to the water says ""ocean"" and a third arrow pointing to the line on the measuring cup where the water stops. It’s the same line as in the first photo and the arrow says ""ocean level remains the same."" ""A little science lesson for the #IDIOTS at the global warming conference,"" the post’s author wrote. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  That’s because the image misrepresents how icebergs affect sea level rise.  An iceberg is a chunk of ice that broke off from a glacier, ice shelf, or a larger iceberg. They float in the ocean (or lake) and unlike sea ice that freezes and melts in the ocean, icebergs are composed of freshwater because they formed on land.  When an iceberg melts, it doesn’t raise sea levels, said Walt Meier, a research scientist with the National Snow & Ice Data Center. But, he said, that’s because the iceberg already raised sea levels when it moved from the land into the ocean.  A better illustration of how icebergs affect sea level, said William Colgan a senior researcher at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, would be to suspend an ice cube on popsicle sticks above the water. When it drops into the water or melts into the water, the water level will rise.  ""Here they’re starting with icebergs in the water,"" Colgan said. ""But the moment the iceberg crosses land into water, it’s raising sea level.""  And if you were to then warm the water in the cup and measure it closely enough, Colgan said, the water level would rise. That’s because warm water expands; according to NASA, ""sea level rise is caused primarily by two factors related to global warming: the added water from melting ice sheets and glaciers and the expansion of seawater as it warms.""  Colgan likened the Facebook post to the same evidence offered by people who think the world is flat. The experiments are conducted in such a way that they support their assumptions while discounting information that contradicts them, he said.  Our ruling The Facebook post claims to show what happens when icebergs melt in water but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Melting ice in water — like the ice featured in the Facebook post — doesn’t cause water levels to rise. That’s because icebergs form on land and then displace water when they break off into the ocean, causing sea levels to rise",False,"August 12, 2019"
"""Fringe leftists are now advocating for cow fart bags to capture farts as a way to help prevent ‘global warming.’""","Are bags being attached to cows’ backs in an attempt to fight climate change?

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The image used in the post is real and was taken in 2008 in Argentina by Reuters photographer Marcos Brindicci. But the soft plastic tank was used by researchers from the National Institute of Agricultural Technology to collect the cow’s burps in order to study the effect its diet had on the production of methane. So, while it is certainly related to the fight against climate change, the bags in the photo were not attached in order to eliminate bovine methane emissions from the atmosphere, but to study the cow’s digestive system and measure the impact of its emissions. Then, in 2013, the same researchers used the bags as a collection system to transform and convert the methane into renewable biofuels. One of the project’s technicians, Ricardo Bualo, said in the institute’s report that the purified and compressed biomethane could be used to generate caloric, light and motor energy: ""A cow emits about 300 liters of methane per day, which can be used to operate a 100-liter refrigerator at a temperature between two and six degrees for a full day,"" he says. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, human activities are responsible for almost all of the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the last 150 years. In 2017, about 9% of U.S. emissions came from the agriculture sector, the agency says. So, yes, scientists are attaching backpacks to cows in order to collect their gas ⁠— burps, not flatulence ⁠— and transform it into renewable energy in an attempt to hamper the levels of methane that the animals release.  But the Facebook post doesn’t explain any of the details of the studies, including the methane’s conversion, and it incorrectly pegs scientists and researchers as ""fringe leftists.""  The post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression",Mostly False,"August 6, 2019"
"""The vast majority of Americans believe that climate change is real and we need to do something about it.""","Over 90% of publishing climate scientists agree that humans are causing global warming. Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, who is running for president, said in a CNN town hall May 30 that public perception is consistent with that consensus. ""The vast majority of Americans believe that climate change is real and we need to do something about it,"" he said. We looked into this claim and found that Bennet, who recently rolled out a plan for 2020 to address climate change, is right that most Americans say climate change is taking place. But polls indicate that the public shows a bit less conviction when asked whether government should address the issue, though much seems to depend on how the questions are asked. Let’s take a look. Bennet’s climate change plan, which was released in May, includes a goal for the United States to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Bennet based his claim on a politics and global warming report published in April by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication. The Yale and GMU programs use social science to help communicate climate change to the public. The report states that 70% of U.S. registered voters said global warming is happening. A majority ""strongly"" or ""somewhat"" support investments in renewable energy research and infrastructure (87%), regulating pollution (82%) and/or taxing pollution (72%). Also, nearly four in ten voters said a candidate’s position on global warming will be very important when they decide who they vote for in the 2020 presidential election. We looked at other polls about climate change and found that responses vary on whether or not Americans believe climate change is real. One way to analyze the first part of Bennet’s statement is to examine Americans’ views on the timeline of the effects of global warming. A Gallup poll conducted in March found that 59% of Americans said that the effects of global warming have already begun and 66% believe it’s mostly due to pollution from human activities. The percentage of people polled who believe the effects of global warming are already underway has fluctuated over the years, but it’s steadily climbed from 49% in 2011 to 52% in 2012 to where we are today. Gallup does note differences in how Americans view the issue based on their political leanings. Among those who describe themselves as conservative, only 25% were classified as concerned believers, compared to 81% of liberals and 56% of moderates.   So, is Bennet also on point when he says that most Americans support doing something about climate change? The results are mixed. A Quinnipiac University poll released in 2018 found that the majority of American voters, 69%, are ""somewhat"" or ""very"" concerned about climate change. But a Pew Research Center survey conducted in January found that only 44% of Americans said global climate change should be a top priority for President Donald Trump and Congress. It was low on a list of 18 issues prioritized by the adults surveyed. However, the environment, categorized as a separate issue, was at No. 8, behind the economy, health care, education, terrorism, Social Security, Medicare and the poor and needy. A Gallup poll conducted last year found that 62% of Americans think the U.S. government is doing too little to protect the environment. The majority of Americans support governmental policies aimed at mitigating climate change such as spending more on solar and wind power (76%), setting higher emissions and pollution standards for businesses and industry (74%) and imposing mandatory controls on greenhouse gas emissions (67%). John Kotcher, a research assistant professor at GMU’s Center for Climate Change Communication, told PolitiFact that views on climate change among scientists and the general public vary in part because people have not always seen the issue as one that directly affects them. ""Historically, climate change has been framed as an environmental issue that’s distant in time and space — that it’s a problem for plants, penguins and polar bears,"" he said. Kotcher helped conduct the survey Bennet’s campaign referenced. Bennet said that ""the vast majority of Americans believe that climate change is real and we need to do something about it."" The polls we reviewed show that the majority of Americans do think the effects of climate change are currently taking place and that they are concerned about it. While one poll found that less than half of Americans believe Congress and Trump should make it a top priority, other polls show that when questioned about specific policies to address global warming, a majority of Americans say they support action",Mostly True,"June 6, 2019"

"""Race is the No. 1 indicator for where toxic and polluting facilities are today.""","If elected president, Democratic candidate Beto O’Rourke said he’d launch a $5 trillion plan to combat climate change and invest in communities already dealing with its impact. ""Climate change has a distressingly disproportionate impact on poor and minority communities across the United States and around the world,"" said O’Rourke in his plan released April 29. ""Race is the No. 1 indicator for where toxic and polluting facilities are today."" We rated Mostly False another claim in O’Rourke’s plan regarding the number of people with ""unsafe"" drinking water. This time, we wondered if he was right about race and the placement of toxic facilities. O'Rourke's claim mirrors a statement by an NAACP program that highlights environmental and climate issues affecting communities of color and low-income, and draws from a 2016 editorial in The Nation citing examples of ""environmental racism."" We asked about half a dozen experts to weigh in to help us evaluate the claim and O’Rourke’s evidence. They said that while different types of studies can yield varying results, there’s research supporting O’Rourke’s point. ""There is ample evidence that toxic and polluting facilities are disproportionately​ located in communities of color and low-income,"" said David Konisky, an Indiana University professor who researches environmental justice. The types of facilities that O’Rourke is talking about include coal-fired power plants, hazardous waste landfills and incinerators, oil refineries, and chemical manufacturers. ""The vast majority of research indicates that in the United States, minorities, particularly blacks and Hispanics, are disproportionately burdened by environmental hazards of pollution as compared to whites,"" said Jeremy Mennis, a geographer and professor at Temple University. Blacks and Hispanics in the United States tend to be poorer than whites, so there’s been some debate on whether the geographic disparity of these facilities is due to race or socioeconomic status, Mennis said. But even when socioeconomic factors are similar across white and non-white communities, minorities are still more likely to be near environmental hazards, said Paul Mohai, an environmental justice expert and professor at the University of Michigan. Some studies have found that the racial composition of a neighborhood is a stronger predictor than income, property value, and other socioeconomic factors, Mohai said. Those studies used ""distance-based"" methods and examined racial and socioeconomic disparities at the time of the facilities’ siting. In a study published in 2015, Mohai and Robin Saha, a collaborator at the University of Montana, explored which came first to a neighborhood, people of color and low-income, or commercial hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities. They examined facilities sited from 1966 to 1995 and the demographic composition of host neighborhoods around the time of siting and demographic changes after siting. ""Our findings show that rather than hazardous waste (treatment, storage, and disposal facilities) 'attracting' people of color, neighborhoods with already disproportionate and growing concentrations of people of color appear to 'attract' new facility siting,"" their study said.  Experts said that factors analyzed regarding the racial disparity in the location of hazardous facilities include: •  intentional discrimination in siting; • historical zoning and land use patterns related to segregation and redlining; • minority communities having less political clout to fight back a proposed facility; • and a ""coming to the nuisance"" phenomenon in which after a facility decides where to locate, people of color and low-income move in as property values and quality of life decline, and people who can afford to move out do so. This general topic has been studied for decades and has yielded varying results as researchers employ different methodologies. A 1995 report by the U.S. General Accounting Office summarized findings in 10 studies mainly focused on the demographics of people living near hazardous waste facilities. (The agency’s name changed in 2004 to the Government Accountability Office.) The studies’ conclusions varied, the report said, because researchers used different methodologies, different definitions of ""racial minority"" and analyzed different types of facilities. GAO told PolitiFact it wasn’t aware of an updated version of the 1995 report. Journalist’s Resource, a website that curates scholarly studies and reports, in September published a research roundup centered around environmental justice. It pointed out that people most at risk of living near toxic waste sites are often low-income or racial/ethnic minorities. The roundup included state-specific studies with different results. A 2000 study on Texas and Louisiana said that race was ""not a significant correlate with the location of hazardous waste sites."" But a 2009 study on Illinois said, ""Our results support prior research that suggested race, rather than class, was the major indicator of environmental inequality."" The 2016 editorial in The Nation, which O’Rourke’s campaign flagged as evidence, linked to a 1983 GAO report and to 1987 and 2007 studies prepared by researchers for the United Church of Christ. (The church engages in racial and social justice advocacy.) The GAO report focused on hazardous waste landfills in eight southeastern states and found that blacks represented the majority of the population in three of the four communities where landfills were located. More than a quarter of the population in all four communities had below-poverty income and most of that population was black. The 1987 study for the United Church of Christ said race was the ""most significant"" among the variables tested regarding the location of commercial hazardous waste facilities. The 2007 study said race continued to be an ""independent predictor"" for the location of the facilities and ""a stronger predictor than income, education and other socioeconomic indicators."" Mohai was one of the principal authors of that 2007 study. The 1987 study was ""seminal"" and helped launch the environmental justice movement, said Jill Witkowski Heaps, an environmental justice expert and visiting professor at the University at Buffalo School of Law. O’Rourke said, ""Race is the No. 1 indicator for where toxic and polluting facilities are today."" Several studies say that racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to live near hazardous waste facilities and other plants. They’ve also found that race is a stronger indicator than other variables, such as income or property value. There isn’t consensus on O’Rourke’s claim, but much research and feedback from experts support his claim",Mostly True,"May 14, 2019"
"""I’m one of the first guys to introduce a climate change bill, way, way back in ‘87.""","Joe Biden may not be the most progressive candidate in the crowded Democratic primary field. But one thing is for certain: Among 2020 presidential candidates, he has the longest legislative record on climate change. In fact, Biden has taken this title a good deal further by claiming to have pioneered some of the earliest climate change legislation in U.S. history. ""I’m one of the first guys to introduce a climate change bill, way, way back in ‘87,"" Biden said during a stump speech in Des Moines, Iowa, on May 1. We were curious if that was accurate. A review of the legislative history shows Biden is right. The Delaware senator’s first climate change bill, introduced in 1986, died in the Senate. But the following year a version of Biden’s legislation survived as an amendment to a State Department funding bill. President Ronald Reagan went on to sign it into law. The upshot of Biden’s Global Climate Protection Act was to call on the president to set up a task force to plan how to mitigate global warming. Biden spoke about the bill on the Senate floor in January 1987 in terms that seem uncannily familiar to present-day warnings. He discussed, among other ills, the threat to human habitat resulting from melting polar ice caps and rising sea levels. ""Life on this planet exists only under highly specialized circumstances,"" Biden said during a Senate session. ""Indeed, so special are these circumstances that even a small rise in temperature could disrupt the entire complicated environment that has nurtured life as we know it."" The measure also called on the president to make climate change a higher priority item on the U.S.-Soviet agenda. ""President Reagan told Secretary General Gorbachev ‘that if we had an invasion from Mars, both sides would put aside our differences.’ While not an exterrestrial threat, global warming could prove no less dangerous,"" Biden said. Biden’s amendment became law when Reagan signed the Foreign Relations Authorization Act on Dec. 12, 1987. Biden’s bill was not the first time Congress focused on climate change. In 1976 — decades before making the Academy Award-winning documentary ""An Inconvenient Truth"" — a 28-year old freshman congressman named Al Gore, D-Tenn., held House hearings on climate change. In 1985, then-Sen. Gore introduced a concurrent resolution — a non-binding legislative measure — in which both chambers of Congress asked the president to an international research program on greenhouse gas emissions.   But it was a Senate hearing in June 1986 that historians recall as a watershed moment in the public’s understanding of the threat posed by global warming. Biden’s Republican colleague in the Senate, John Chafee of Rhode Island, held the hearings.  ""This is not a matter of Chicken Little telling us the sky is falling,"" Chafee said at the hearing. ""The scientific evidence … is telling us we have a problem, a serious problem."" The show-stopping moment came when Dr. James Hansen of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies declared that, based on his climate modeling, significant warming could be observed much earlier than previously thought, perhaps as soon as 5 to 15 years.  Source: The Washington Post front page on June 11, 1986. It was several months after the Chafee hearings that Biden introduced the prototype of his bill, a version of which would clear Congress the following year. It’s worth noting that Biden introduced his measure several months before Chafee sponsored a separate bill, the Stratospheric Ozone and Climate Protection Act. Most experts we consulted said yes. ""I think Biden’s 1986 bill was the first introduced in Congress on this issue,"" said Sean Hecht, an environmental law professor at UCLA. ""He gets credit for that."" While other legislation predates Biden’s bill, they addressed climate generally and didn’t cite global warming mitigation as a specific goal, wrote Roel Hammerschlag, an associate scientist at the Stockholm Environment Institute, in a 2007 law review article. At the same time, it’s important not to overstate the impact of Biden’s bill, said Josh Howe, a professor of history and environmental studies at Reed College. ""It's significant insofar as Biden has been more or less on top of the issue since the mid '80s. But let's not stretch the intent of the bill and suggest that this was a comprehensive plan for reducing emissions or adapting to the consequences of climatic change,"" he said. ""It was a plan to make a plan. Which, of course, neither Reagan nor Bush ultimately did."" Some historians argue that climate change and greenhouse gases were the motivation behind a provision of the Clean Air Act of 1963, according to John Reilly, an MIT professor and climate change expert.  Even if you take the view that the Clean Air Act, or Gore’s non-binding resolution, should be classified as climate change bills, Biden didn’t claim to propose the first climate change bill — rather, he claimed he was one of the first. Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate staff member who is now a strategic advisor at the Progressive Policy Institute, told us Biden deserves his due. ""Without question, Biden was among the earliest supporters of climate change action in Congress,"" Bledsoe said. ""His 1987 bill was focused on forcing the Reagan Administration to establish a wide-ranging White House Task Force on Climate Change, a critical action that in fact was not taken until the Clinton Administration, so it was both prescient and influential on long-term policy."" Biden said, ""I’m one of the first guys to introduce a climate change bill, way, way back in ‘87."" There had been some high-profile hearings about climate change on the Hill, as well as a non-binding resolution prior to Biden’s proposal.

"""60 million Americans live in a place where the water they drink is unsafe.""","Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke said he would launch a 10-year, $5 trillion plan to combat climate change, which he considers the country’s greatest threat. O’Rourke said he’d invest in infrastructure, because aging systems and climate change impact the quality of water Americans drink. ""Sixty million Americans live in a place where the water they drink is unsafe,"" O’Rourke said April 29. Flint, Mich., became a campaign stop and political talking point in the 2016 presidential election as the city grappled with lead-contaminated water. (We examined the city’s water quality progress a year ago.) Is O’Rourke, a former congressman from Texas, right about 60 million Americans not having safe drinking water? O’Rourke based his claim on an August 2017 investigation by News21. We found that his framing is more conclusive than the investigation and needs context. News21 is a national student investigative initiative at the Walter Cronkite School School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University. Its reporters analyzed 680,000 violations logged over a 10-year period (starting Jan. 1, 2007) in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Safe Drinking Water Information System. News21 examined violations by active community water systems, a type of public water system that supplies water to the same population year-round. (This does not include, for example, schools, factories, hospitals, or campgrounds where people don’t stay for a long time.) The review homed in on violations for health, monitoring and reporting. The team documented EPA violations around the country, from rural communities in California to New York City boroughs. They found that many local water treatment plants — especially in poor, minority and small communities — didn’t have the money to buy the equipment needed to filter out contaminants. Those include arsenic found naturally in rock, factory chemicals and fecal matter from farming. The finding most relevant to this fact-check: As many as 63 million people were exposed to potentially unsafe water more than once during the 10-year period analyzed. O’Rourke’s statement reflects the News21 estimate, but leaves out the nuance — the story didn’t outright say 63 million are actively affected, and it noted that some places had resolved their water issues. (Further, the EPA acknowledged that the database might not include all violations and that some information may be incorrect.) The majority of people in affected areas ​might have been exposed to unsafe drinking water only for a very short period of time, said Newsha Ajami, director of Urban Water Policy for the Water in the West initiative at Stanford University. O’Rourke’s number is ""broadly reasonable,"" said Manny Teodoro, an associate professor in the department of political science at Texas A&M University. But he emphasized that it needed the caveat of being ""potentially"" unsafe. Generally, while many systems have improved, regulations have also become more stringent over time, and new contaminants are always being discovered, he said. We kept looking for other estimates of Americans drinking ""unsafe"" water. Nationwide, nearly 21 million people relied on community water systems in 2015 that violated health-based standards, according to a 2018 study from the University of California, Irvine and Columbia University. It was unclear how many customers had contaminated water at their tap, said one of the authors of the paper, Maura Allaire, an assistant professor of water economics and policy at the University of California, Irvine. While drinking water contaminants over a long period of time can be harmful, many contaminants don’t pose immediate health risks and many only last for several weeks or less, she said. Allaire’s study did not include monitoring and reporting violations, unlike News21, because she said it’s unclear how to interpret those violations  — some of them stem from administrative errors or delays that don’t directly impact water quality. Data from the EPA for fiscal year 2017 provides a similar estimate for community water systems with health-based violations. Among other limitations, however, the EPA data does not say how many people actually received water that didn’t meet standards. According to the EPA’s website, ""there is no way to know."" According to the EPA, about 30.6 million were served by community water systems with violations in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 (October 2018 through December 2018). For the most part, U.S. water systems are safe and reliable, experts said. And short-term violations are different from failing systems that cannot provide safe drinking water over long periods of time. Those failing systems are often found in rural and low-income communities. Better data tracking is needed. Currently, the system for monitoring water quality depends on self-reporting. For smaller systems, that’s an issue, due to lack of employees, technology and finances, said Ajami, the water policy expert. Plus, there is no data on the water quality of private wells. O’Rourke said that ""60 million Americans live in a place where the water they drink is unsafe."" Overall, it’s difficult to say how many people in the United States have unsafe drinking water. The EPA said about 22 million people were served by community water systems with reported health-based violations in fiscal 2017. But the EPA could not determine how many people actually received water in violation. The agency also said that some violations can be as brief as an hour. O’Rourke’s claim is an imprecise interpretation of a complicated report by News21. News21 said that as many as 63 million people were exposed to potentially unsafe water more than once during a 10-year period starting in 2007. That doesn’t necessarily mean all currently have unsafe water, as O’Rourke concluded. Moreover, experts said that monitoring and reporting violations are important, but do not directly indicate water safety. O’Rourke’s statement is more definitive than the data available and than the report on which he based his claim",Mostly False,"May 7, 2019"
"""When the wind stops blowing, that’s the end of your electric.""","One of President Donald Trump’s new favorite political targets is Democrats’ Green New Deal, a sweeping approach to combating climate change. That plan embraces a greater reliance on renewable energy sources — like solar and wind — over a decade. Trump has trained his fire on wind power in particular during several recent speeches, claiming that consumers face major blackouts from nothing more than a simple shift in weather. And Trump’s disdain for wind energy, as the Washington Post notes, has even deeper roots. ""When the wind stops blowing, that's the end of your electric,"" Trump told the Conservative Political Action Conference March 2. ""Let's hurry up. ‘Darling, is the wind blowing today? I'd like to watch television, darling.’ "" Trump continued hammering wind energy later that month at a rally in Michigan, saying that if Hillary Clinton had won the election the United States would not be a global leader in energy production. ""You would be doing wind, windmills,"" Trump said March 28. ""And if it doesn't blow you can forget about television for that night."" The president’s riffs on wind energy grossly oversimplify things — perhaps for comedic effect. But the latest White House budget proposal would slash funding for renewable energy programs across the country. So we thought his comments were worth checking. Ensuring uninterrupted electricity when using renewable energy is a legitimate concern. Wind energy — and solar, for that matter — are considered ""intermittent energy sources,"" because of their dependence on weather conditions. But the issue is a manageable one under the current system, experts said. First off, the notion that a person gets electricity from only one wind farm is wrong. That’s because American energy consumers in virtually all cases get their power from an interconnected grid, which pools together a portfolio of different generators. ""No home connected to the continental U.S. grid is primarily reliant on the wind the occupant feels in their backyard,"" said Daniel Schwartz, a professor at the University of Washington and director of the Clean Energy Institute. For example, in the western United States, Schwartz said, power generation and consumption is transmitted across roughly a dozen states and Canadian provinces. ""On a still day in Seattle, the wind is blowing in Montana, or California, or elsewhere,"" he said. Michael Gillenwater, executive director of the Greenhouse Gas Management Institute, responded to Trump’s claim this way: ""Just because the wind stops blowing in one place does not mean the whole grid goes down."" Experts noted that utilities typically use a mix of sources to generate energy, including some, like natural gas, that aren’t susceptible to running out if the winds are low or if clouds block the sun. The current energy system has successfully integrated renewables. As of 2018, renewable sources made up around 17 percent of total U.S. energy. Among renewables, hydropower provided the most, at 7 percent, with wind energy a close second. Fossil fuels, on the other hand, accounted for nearly two-thirds of American power.  Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration​ But what would happen to grid stability if the United States increased its reliance on sources like wind and solar? That analysis hinges on several unknown variables, including how much would come from intermittent sources, whether nonrenewables would continue to serve as backups, and the pace of green technology development.   In his CPAC speech, Trump’s criticism of wind energy grew out of his broader disapproval of the Green New Deal. It’s in that context that Trump has a point, said Benjamin Zycher, a resident scholar at the market-oriented American Enterprise Institute who has written a forthcoming book critiquing the Green New Deal. ""If you define the wind power as envisioned by Trump as part of a ‘100% renewable system’ or something approaching it — as defined, say, in the Green New Deal — then Trump is correct,"" he said. Zycher said a 100 percent renewable system would face a series of practical challenges. Batteries cannot currently provide sufficient backup generation, he argued, so the only practical alternative to maintain grid stability would be from a non-renewable source, which would mean maintaining elements of the current system. There’s some debate about whether the Green New Deal is truly pushing for a ""100% renewable system,"" or some lower threshold. The legislative language does not spell out what energy sources would comprise a new grid. In fact, its elasticity on this point appears to be something of a selling point. As Green New Deal co-sponsor Sen. Ed Markey, D.-Mass, said, ""The resolution is silent on any individual technology. We are open to whatever works."" Rather, the proposal calls for ""100% of power demand through clean, renewable, and zero-emissions energy sources."" To some, the plan could encompasses more than just renewables, to include nuclear power, or even fossil fuels with carbon capture. Schwartz, of the Clean Energy Institute, said the challenges of wind power are widely recognized in engineering circles. But he was bullish on the future of green technology. ""My reaction is optimistic,"" he said. ""I see engineering challenges, not insurmountable barriers created by the laws of nature."" Already, some utilities use some of the surplus electricity they generate to pump water uphill, where it can be released downhill to generate electricity as needed. Going forward, researchers are working on additional methods, such as next-generation batteries, to store energy so it can be kept in reserve for slack periods for wind or solar generation. Gillenwater agreed there’s a lively debate about the feasibility of building a 100 percent renewable system, and pointed us to this article from Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers’ magazine. But he noted that ""getting to about 80 percent is generally seen as not a problem technically or economically."" Gideon Weissman, a policy analyst with Frontier Group, said the National Renewable Energy Laboratory has done substantial research on what a greener grid might look like. He added that other research suggests that a renewable grid ""has the potential to be more reliable and resilient than our current electric grid, since it would be less vulnerable to central disruptions."" Trump said, ""When the wind stops blowing, that’s the end of your electric."" In virtually all cases, American energy consumers get their power from an interconnected grid, which pools together a portfolio of different generators. Practically speaking, just because the wind stops blowing in one place does not mean the whole grid goes down. Right now, renewables account for around 17 percent of total U.S. power. Experts say there are some legitimate practical and technological challenges associated with moving to a grid that relies much more heavily on renewable energy than our current system. But engineers are aware of the issues and many believe they are not insurmountable",Mostly False,"April 3, 2019"

Asked in an interview what the Inslee administration would do about global warming in the first 100 days, Inslee said he would make the Pentagon’s budget more eco-friendly, and argued that elements of that concept have already been shown to work. ""We have flown a Boeing 737 across the Atlantic Ocean on biofuels. We have flown F-18s,"" Inslee told Vox. ""So we can use the procurement power of the United States military to drive some of this clean energy."" Inslee was right about biofuels having powered a supersonic jet. We also found that aircraft similar to the 737 completed transatlantic flights on blended fuel, though we didn’t find instances where 737s had done so. Inslee is correct that the U.S. military has flown an F-18 on biofuel. Navy aviators made history in 2010 by flying an F-18 Super Hornet on a 50-50 blend of conventional jet fuel and biofuel—the first time this was attempted in a supersonic jet, according to the Washington Examiner. The 45-minute test flight took place on Earth Day at a Maryland naval base, the Navy’s media wing reported. The biofuel was derived from a plant called camelina, which is native to North America. Prior to the test flight, the Navy said, the Pentagon awarded a $2.7 million contract to a Montana-based renewable fuel company for 40,000 gallons of camelina-based fuel. The environmentally-friendly moves were part of then-Navy Secretary Ray Mabus’s initiative— known as the Great Green Fleet—a $510 million, three-year program to explore cleaner energy options. Under the program, the Navy certified warships and aircraft to operate on biofuels. But according to Todd Harrison, the director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, naval systems do not routinely use biofuels due to their high cost. Harrison seemed skeptical that the military would embrace a dramatic shift to the alternative energy source. ""It is possible that if the Navy started making regular, large-scale purchases of biofuels for its systems that it could help jump start this industry and bring down the price for other consumers,"" Harrison added. ""But that would be a significant investment on the part of the Navy for something that only tangentially benefits the military."" Mabus, for his part, told us he sees climate change and national security as inextricably linked. He argued that as one of the biggest energy consumers on the planet, the Defense Department’s role in combating climate change should not be overlooked. Bottom line: Inslee is right that F-18s have flown on biofuels. But what to make of his claim about 737s? Inslee didn’t specify who he claims flew a Boeing 737 across the Atlantic—and a Navy spokesman said that service branch had never flown this series aircraft on biofuels. We reached out to Inslee’s campaign, and they pointed us to a Boeing press release that described the company’s development of a fuel that blended petroleum fuel and ""bio-derived oils and waste animal fats."" The press release also mentions Boeing’s work with Virgin Atlantic on a 2008 bio-fueled test flight. But it doesn’t say anything about flying a 737 across the Atlantic Ocean on biofuels. (We reached out to Boeing directly but didn’t hear back.) That said, we did find numerous examples of transatlantic flights powered by biofuels. Boeing posted a clip on YouTube in 2011 of a 747-8 Freighter completing what the plane maker described as ""the first-ever transatlantic biofuel flight with a commercial jetliner."" A Lufthansa 747 made the first biofuel-powered transatlantic commercial flight to the United States in 2012, and two years later Finnair used a cooking oil-based biofuel to fly an Airbus A330 from Helsinki to New York. In 2018, United Airlines celebrated the ""longest transatlantic biofuel flight to date"" when a 787 Dreamliner flew from San Francisco to Zurich. Inslee said, ""We have flown a Boeing 737 across the Atlantic Ocean on biofuels. We have flown F-18s."" The Navy made history in 2010 when it flew an F-18 supersonic jet on biofuels. We found numerous transatlantic flights that have been powered by biofuels, too. We weren’t able to find instances where Boeing 737s had done so, but those are similar to other aircraft we documented",Mostly True,"March 21, 2019"
"""We have developed a wind industry (in Washington state) from zero to $6 billion in 12 years.""","Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has made fighting climate change the top priority of his 2020 Democratic presidential bid. In a sit-down with CNN, Inslee touted his state’s success in adopting renewable energy technology over a relatively short time span. ""We have done some good things,"" Inslee told CNN’s Jake Tapper March 10. ""We have developed a wind industry from zero to $6 billion in 12 years."" Inslee’s claim about Washington state’s wind energy investment was on the money. But if it sounds like Inslee is taking credit for it, it's worth noting he was governor for only a brief period during this build-up.  We traced Inslee’s stat to a fact sheet on Washington from the American Wind Energy Association. The AWEA fact sheet puts capital investment in the Evergreen State’s wind industry at $6.1 billion through 2017. A footnote to that dollar figure states that the calculation is ""based on national and state averages."" We weren’t sure what that meant, so we reached out to AWEA and independent experts for clarification. Daniel Schwartz, a professor at the University of Washington and director of the Clean Energy Institute, walked us through how the numbers are crunched. A typical approach to estimating the value of wind investment in a given area begins by figuring out that area’s amount of generating capacity, as measured in megawatts. One megawatt is equivalent to 1 million watts. For instance, Washington state had 3,075 megawatts of wind capacity at the end of 2017, according to the Department of Energy, ranking it 10th in the nation. Texas blew away the rest of the country with 22,599 megawatts of overall wind electricity generation. Here’s a nationwide snapshot from the most recent Department of Energy report: The cost of installing a wind turbine changes from year to year based on market forces. So arriving at a grand total of wind investment requires calculating the cost for each year, then adding up those annual figures. To determine the cost of wind investment, you take the amount of megawatts of capacity added in a given year, and multiply that figure by the average cost for installed wind projects that year. Pricing data — measured in terms of dollars per megawatt — comes from the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. ""We use a national or regional average price per megawatt, rather than an actual price to acquire the generating capacity,"" Schwartz explained. ""That’s because the actual contracted price each utility got from the vendor is not generally reported to the public."" AWEA confirmed this was essentially their methodology to reach the $6.1 billion figure for Washington’s total capital investment in wind farms—all of which was built in the 13 years between 2001 and 2014. (They noted that the value is a bit higher if you factor inflation.) Inslee became governor in 2013.  As for the time element of Inslee’s claim, AWEA said the state’s investment in 2001 was relatively meager. So the governor’s claim that the investment took place over 12 years is basically correct. A spokesman for the Department of Energy’s renewable energy office said AWEA’s numbers were in line with federal pricing data from the department’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. They, too, noted the value is higher if you factor inflation. Inslee said, ""We've developed a wind industry from zero to $6 billion in 12 years."" His figure is backed up by the American Wind Energy Association and federal pricing data from the Department of Energy. The vast majority of Washington’s wind energy capital was invested over a 12-year period, from 2002 through 2014. It's worth noting that Inslee became governor only in 2013. The statement is accurate but needs additional information",Mostly True,"March 13, 2019"
"""The forest fires were so grotesque last year that we had the worst air in the world in Washington.""","Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, one of the Democrats running for president in 2020, has made climate change the centerpiece of his days-old campaign. Shortly before making his run official, he discussed the importance of climate change in an interview and made this claim about the impact of fires on his state: ""The forest fires were so grotesque last year that we had the worst air in the world in Washington. We were choking. It’s a very personal thing for me."" A couple of days after launching his campaign, Inslee repeated the worst-air claim during another discussion about climate change. We wanted to know whether Washington really had worse air quality than in India or China in 2018. We also wanted to explore how much climate change had to do with it. As smoke from wildfires blanketed the area during the summer of 2018, Seattle news reports said Seattle had the worst air quality in the world on Aug. 21, 2018. The reports cited rankings that day from AirVisual, an air monitoring service. AirVisual spokeswoman Kelsey Duska told us that during at least some points of that day, Seattle had the worst air among 85 cities, generally with a population of more than 400,000, around the world. Washington fared a little better in a broader set of monitoring done by AirVisual. Duska said that for the entire month of August 2018, the air in Chelan, Wash., about 180 miles east of Seattle, ranked fifth-worst among 3,000 cities worldwide. Rob Jackson, a Stanford University earth system science professor, told us that AirVisual’s numbers are reliable. So, Inslee’s worst-air claim is correct — for one day of the year. As for Inslee’s larger point, experts told us that climate change played a role in making the wildfires, and thus air quality, worse, but that other factors did, too. Inslee’s campaign pointed us to an article posted on National Public Radio’s website in the wake of the news reports about Seattle’s worst-air ranking. It carried this headline: ""Why Seattle had the worst air quality in the world at some points this summer."" The article was a transcript of an interview with Cliff Mass, professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington. Maas said Seattle had had the worst air in 20 years — to the point that mountains and water around the city were not visible. Asked why the air was so bad, Mass cited the wildfires, adding that ""we had an atmospheric circulation that took the smoke directly from these nearby fires right over Seattle."" And Mass said he suspects that it would happen again in the future — but he pointed to forests, not climate change. ""Well, the big problem is our forests. We've suppressed fire now for almost a century,"" he said. ""A lot of the forests surrounding Seattle are in very bad condition. They're overgrown. They have a lot of slash, a lot of low bushes and trees. And they're completely unlike the forests that were here 150 years ago. And the problem is when they burn, they burn catastrophically. ""The question is how much of this is climate change. I suspect that only a small proportion of this is climate change. I think that the main problem is the forests, which are ready to burn. We have invasive grasses that have moved in that burn very easily. And human beings are increasingly starting fires with this huge number of people going in for recreation, other uses of the forested areas,"" he said.

""Now, on the long term, as the planet warms up, we certainly would expect more fires. So climate change, global warming probably contributed a small amount to it, but probably the key thing is what we've done to the surface of the planet."" Other experts gave more weight to the role of climate change. Stanford’s Jackson and John Reilly, co-director of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change at MIT, told us that climate change clearly is one factor in making the wildfires, and in turn air quality, worse. But they agreed that other factors, such as fire suppression, have also made the wildfires worse. Finally, Inslee’s campaign also pointed us to two other articles about wildfires and climate change: McClatchy news service reported on a federal study in November 2018 that said, ""California and the West have already witnessed an expansion of catastrophic blazes due to climate change and rising warming, with twice as much acreage burned by wildfire than would have occurred otherwise."" And Scientific American reported on an academic study that, according to the magazine, found that climate change not only is increasing the likelihood of wildfires, the ""wildfires are causing a spike in air pollution across the West.""   However, Daniel Jaffe, a University of Washington professor of environmental chemistry, said in that article that while climate change makes wildfires worse, so does forest management. In discussing climate change, Inslee said, ""The forest fires were so grotesque last year that we had the worst air in the world in Washington."" By one measure, of 85 major cities across the globe, Seattle had the worst air quality in the world on Aug. 21, 2018, as wildfires pushed smoke into the area. That was for one day of the year. Experts said climate change is one factor in making the forest fires, and in turn air quality, worse; but other factors, such as fire suppression practices, have also made the fires worse",True,"March 8, 2019"
"The Democrats’ Green New Deal includes ""working towards ending air travel.""","After U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., unveiled the Green New Deal, Republican critics said it would eventually ground air travel. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., outlined his opposition to the Democrats’ Green New Deal in a Feb. 25th Orlando Sentinel op-ed: ""If you are not familiar with it, here’s the cliff notes version: It calls for rebuilding or retrofitting every building in America in the next 10 years, eliminating all fossil fuels in 10 years, eliminating nuclear power, and working towards ending air travel (to be replaced with high-speed rail)."" Scott described mayhem if a Democrat wins the presidency; some 2020 presidential candidates are co-sponsors of the Green New Deal. ""What then? Tear down all buildings, eliminate oil and gas, and stop air travel?"" Let’s hit the brakes right there -- do the Democrats want to end air travel?  We found that Scott is ignoring the actual text of the resolution. The resolution does not ground airplanes, either now or in the future. And climate advocates told us the elimination of air travel isn’t a practical goal. The ""Green New Deal,"" resolution was introduced by Ocasio-Cortez on Feb. 7 and has 89 Democratic co-sponsors. A companion measure in the Senate, introduced by Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., has nearly a dozen sponsors -- all Democrats -- including presidential candidates Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Broadly, these resolutions address ways to curb climate change and protect the environment. Even if it were to pass both chambers, the resolution would be nonbinding. So what does the House resolution say about air travel? In a word, nothing. It makes no mention of airplanes at all. It does call for ""overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible,"" which includes ""investment in high-speed rail."" We reached out to Scott’s press office and did not hear back by deadline, but the senator was probably referring to some supporting documents released by Ocasio-Cortez’s staff. A frequently asked questions, or FAQ, document mentioned airplanes twice, stating (emphasis ours) ""we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast, but we think we can ramp up renewable manufacturing and power production, retrofit every building in America, build the smart grid, overhaul transportation and agriculture, plant lots of trees and restore our ecosystem to get to net-zero."" The FAQ also called for the United States to ""totally overhaul transportation by massively expanding electric vehicle manufacturing, build charging stations everywhere, build out high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary, create affordable public transit available to all, with goal to replace every combustion-engine vehicle."" (For the record, according to the UC Santa Barbara ScienceLine, ""cows do contribute to global warming, although in fact they mostly do so by burping rather than farting."") As soon as the the FAQ document became public, the idea that the Democrats wanted to make air travel obsolete was picked up by Fox News and some Republican politicians, including President Donald Trump. Ocasio-Cortez’s press office did not reply for this fact-check, but her chief of staff previously said that there were many shared documents among various interest groups, and that the release of this particular document was a mistake. Experts on climate change say it’s important to focus on the language in the actual resolution and not the FAQ, which carries no weight. ""It seems to me those lines from the FAQ were lighthearted and ill-considered, and it’s not clear why they were posted,"" said Sean Hecht, Co-Executive Director, Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at UCLA law school. Hecht noted that the FAQ doesn’t include any regulatory strategy to ban or even reduce air travel. ""It’s framed even in the FAQ as creating conditions where ‘air travel stops becoming necessary’ because alternatives are available -- not limiting or ending air travel,"" he said. David Weiskopf, climate policy director for NextGen Climate America, said the Green New Deal calls for a ""net-zero"" goal, which recognizes that emissions -- including from air travel -- won’t be eliminated in 10 years, so there would need to find negative emissions to balance them out. (NextGen Climate America was started by billionaire Tom Steyer. In 2018, the PAC supported Scott’s Democratic opponent, Bill Nelson.) ""The comment about cows and planes is not at all an expression of a policy goal to actually eliminate either. It is delivering information that some supporters may not want to hear -- that we will not zero out emissions completely, so we need some additional negative emissions -- expressed in what I take to be a colloquial tone that unfortunately left it open to misconstrual by critics,"" he said. ""No serious observer, supporter of the Green New Deal, climate scientist, or other climate advocate would take these statements as expressing a policy aim to eliminate cows or planes."" Air travel retains a unique role in moving people long distances. ""When people rank the difficulty of finding structural solutions to greenhouse gas emissions in various sectors, air travel is one of the hardest both technologically and practically, and there aren’t serious policy proposals yet that would solve the issue through limiting air travel or changing the energy sources for commercial aircraft on a significant scale,"" Hecht said. ""So it’s not a priority for policy."" Serious steps that the United States could take to reduce emissions from air travel emissions would include more efficient planes, more direct routes and alternative bio-based low-carbon fuels. In the long run, electric planes may be feasible, said Paul Bledsoe, a strategic advisor at the Progressive Policy Institute and a lecturer on environmental policy at American University. ""No serious climate experts advocate ending air travel -- that's simply a red-herring,"" said Bledsoe, who was a climate change advisor to the Clinton White House. Time to bring this fact-check in for a landing. Scott wrote in an op-ed that the Democrats’ Green New Deal includes ""working towards ending air travel."" The resolution makes no mention of ending air travel. Instead, it calls for ""overhauling transportation systems,"" which includes ""investment in high-speed rail."" Scott seized on a messaging document from Democrats that mentioned, perhaps in jest, getting rid of ""farting cows and airplanes."" But we found no evidence that getting rid of airplanes is a serious policy idea from climate advocates",False,"February 28, 2019"
"""Our country has succeeded in reducing greenhouse emissions in previous years.""","Republican Rep. Morgan Griffith, who represents the 9th Congressional District in Southwest Virginia suffering from the decline of coal mining, recently derided Democratic resolutions to end greenhouse emissions in 10 years. The non-binding, identical, non-binding measures, called the ""Green New Deal,"" were introduced Feb. 7 in the House by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and in the Senate by Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass. Eighty Democrats have co-sponsored the resolutions, including six announced presidential candidates for 2020. The resolutions call for federal mobilization to curb climate change and protect the environment. They also broadly support Democratic aspirations to increase hourly wages, strengthen labor unions and make higher education accessible ""to all the people of the United States."" The measures don’t lay out specific programs to achieve the goals or revenues to finance them, other than saying the changes will pay for themselves. Griffith, in a Feb. 11 newsletter to constituents, said the environmental reforms were impractical, industry-killing and unnecessary. ""Our country has succeeded in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in previous years,"" he wrote. ""We did it with improved technology that increased energy efficiency and brought down the costs of cleaner fuel sources. This is the blueprint for a future that holds both cleaner air and water and greater prosperity."" We fact-checked Griffith’s claim that the U.S. has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions. Kevin Baird, Griffith’s communications director, told us the statement was based on data published by the Environmental Protection Agency in its ""Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gases and Sinks, 1990-2017."" It’s the latest edition of an annual report, released April 12, 2018. The report shows U.S. greenhouse emissions dropped from a peak 7,371 metric tons in 2007 to 6,472 metric tons in 2017 - the last year available. That’s an 11.8 percent decrease over the span, or an average 1.1 percent yearly decrease. The fall was not steady, however. During four years, emissions went up, during seven years, they went down. Much attention has been focused on the final three years of data. Emissions dropped by 2 percent in both 2015 and 2016, but only three-tenths of 1 percent in 2017. In other words, the rate of decrease was slowing. But there’s a problem: The EPA report Griffith sites is out of date. More recent research indicates greenhouse emissions rose in 2018. The research focuses on carbon dioxide discharges, which account for about 80 percent of greenhouse emissions. A report issued In January 2019 by the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm, estimated carbon emissions rose by 3.4 percent in in 2018 - the first increase in four years. That puts carbon emissions at about the same they were in the mid-1990s. The latest records from the Energy Information Administration, a data-collecting unit of the federal Energy Department, show carbon emissions for the first 10 months of 2018 were 3.2 percent higher than discharges during the first 10 months of 2017 Energy analysts generally attribute the slow overall decline in emissions from 2007 to 2017 to energy conservation caused by the Great Recession and its recovery, and the shift in electricity production from coal to natural gas, wind and solar power. On the other hand, Rhodium says the 2018 increase was largely caused by a booming economy that led to more emissions from factories, planes and trucks. Another factor was weather: A cold winter in parts of the country led to an increase in oil and gas consumption for heat. The EIA expects things to slow this year, predicting an 0.2 increase in carbon emissions. Rhodium said it doesn’t ""expect a repeat of 2018 this coming year."" Let’s to return to Griffith. It should be noted that some of the decrease in emissions that he lauds might not have happened if he had succeeded in his goal of reviving the coal industry. Our ruling ""Our country has succeeded in reducing greenhouse emissions in previous years,"" Griffith said in arguing against a Democratic resolution for an all-out effort to end the emissions in a decade. Griffith cites an EPA report released early last year showing emissions dropped 11.8 percent between 2007 and 2017. It went down three straight years between 2015 and 2017, although by declining amounts. But Griffith ignores more current research that alters his picture. The Rhodium Group estimates carbon emissions - the source of most greenhouse gases - increased by 3.4 percent last year. EIA data shows it went up 3.2 during the first 10 months of 2018, compared to the first 10 months of 2017. So you can argue this either way. During the last dozen years, emissions went up five times and down seven. On one hand, they're down 10 percent over the last 12 years; on the other, emissions are at the same level they were in the mid-1990s",Half True,"February 26, 2019"
"""Climate change is nothing but a bunch of computer models that attempt to tell us what's going to happen in 50 years or 30. Notice the predictions are never for next year or the next 10 years. They're always for way, way, way, way out there, when none of us are going to be around or alive to know whether or not they were true.""","Conservative pundit Rush Limbaugh dismissed climate change as the work of agenda-driven computer models spitting out threats that loom just beyond the horizon, where scientists can elude accountability for their dubious predictions. ""Climate change is nothing but a bunch of computer models that attempt to tell us what's going to happen in 50 years or 30,"" Limbaugh said on Fox News Sunday. ""Notice the predictions are never for next year or the next ten years. They're always for way, way, way, way out there, when none of us are going to be around or alive to know whether or not they were true."" What's not true, in this case, is what Limbaugh said. We'll explain why with the help of scientists.  The first problem with Limbaugh’s claim is this: Climate change is already happening. Its impact is seen around the world. Here’s the topline: The broad scientific consensus is that human factors are the main contributor to global warming, with carbon dioxide emissions primarily driving up the earth’s temperature, which are now at record levels. ""Utter nonsense,"" is how climate scientist Kevin Trenberth characterized Limbaugh’s claim. ""We can simply look at the actual climate record,"" said Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. ""The Earth is now hotter than it has ever been on record."" The last four years were the hottest on record, according to an analysis by the World Meteorological Organization of five leading international datasets. In 2018, the oceans as a whole — which contain most of the earth’s energy — were the hottest on record, according to an international panel of scientists who track the data. What’s more, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s leading authority on climate change has concluded with high confidence that ""impacts on natural and human systems from global warming have already been observed."" Last summer, the Arctic ice cover in the Svalbard area of Norway was found to be 40 percent below average for that time of year, according to the Norwegian Ice Service, which tracks data going back to 1981. Scientists also point to an uptick in extreme weather. Trenberth noted that rainfalls are heavier in most places around the world, and that 2015 was the most active hurricane year globally on record. ""It’s not just ‘a bunch of computer models,’ "" said Gavin Schmidt, a climatologist and director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. ""Climate change is visible in hundreds of independent observational data sets of land, ice, ocean, ecosystems."" Limbaugh said climate predictions are always pegged to some distant future, ""when none of us are going to be around or alive to know whether or not they were true."" But what about predictions from decades past? According to Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist with Berkeley Earth, these older projections have largely been borne out. ""Broadly speaking, climate models have been quite skillful over the past 30 years in predicting warming in the years after they were published,"" said Hausfather, who assessed previous climate change models in an analysis for the website Carbon Brief. He cited the example of Columbia University scientist Wally Broecker, who in 1975 predicted global temperatures would rise due to increased CO2 emissions.  ""Broecker predicted by 2010 the world would have warmed by around 0.74C,"" Hausfather said. ""In reality, it warmed by 0.62C, which is pretty good for a very rudimentary climate model in the 1970s."" Scientists often focus on longer-term projections because a warming trend, relative to natural variability, can be seen more clearly from this timeframe, said John Reilly, a climate scientist at MIT. However, many climate models begin their simulations around 1850, and can project forward through the present day, and up to the year 2100. ""So there are projections for the present and next few years,"" Reilly said. Limbaugh said, ""Climate change is nothing but a bunch of computer models that attempt to tell us what's going to happen in 50 years or 30. Notice the predictions are never for next year or the next ten years. They're always for way, way, way, way out there, when none of us are going to be around or alive to know whether or not they were true."" First, global warming is already happening. Earth is the hottest it has ever been, and the impact is observable. Second, climate change predictions from decades past have largely been borne out. Third, models project further out because it helps show warming trends more clearly, relative to natural variability. But scientists also have near-term projections available",False,"February 19, 2019"
"""We need to also recognize that we just had two of the coldest years, biggest drop in global temperatures that we have had since the 1980s, the biggest in the last 100 years. We don't talk about that.""","If man’s impact on climate goes unchecked, global warming could inflict devastating long-term effects on the environment, economy and public health, warn U.S. government scientists in a major new report. But while some heard the 1,600-page National Climate Assessment as a blaring distress call, others were less alarmed. On NBC’s Meet the Press, Danielle Pletka, a foreign policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, allowed that climate change is happening, but hastened to add that she didn’t know if it’s caused by humans. (In fact, scientists say they are the main contributor.) She argued the issue of climate change is subject to ""hysteria"" and said certain weather phenomena, like periods of global cooling, are overlooked by the mainstream media narrative. ""We need to also recognize that we just had two of the coldest years, biggest drop in global temperatures that we have had since the 1980s, the biggest in the last 100 years,"" Pletka said during a panel discussion. ""We don't talk about that because it's not part of the agenda."" Climate scientists told us that part of Pletka’s claim is false and part is misleading. Pletka said we just had two of the coldest years on record. That’s wrong. Gavin Schmidt, a climatologist and director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, pointed us to a chart of NASA data showing global average temperatures over time:  The far-right dots represent the global temperatures of 2017 and 2016. According to this data, they are actually some of the warmest years on record — which contradicts this portion of Pletka’s claim. We’d note that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which has a slightly different way of calculating temperature, shows 2016 and 2015 as the warmest years on record. In the United States, according to NASA data, 2017 and 2016 were the second- and third-warmest years.  The other piece of Pletka’s claim — about cold spells — was not so much false, as misleading. She told us she was relying on an article from Real Clear Markets with the headline, ""Did You Know the Greatest Two-Year Global Cooling Event Just Took Place?"" The April 2018 article notes that from February 2016 to February 2018 (the latest month available at the time), global average temperatures dropped 0.56 degrees C. ""You have to go back to 1982-84 for the next biggest two-year drop,"" the article states, referring also to the NASA data on global average temperatures. (The 1982-84 drop was 0.47 degrees C.) Climate scientists told us this is technically true, but that it misses the bigger trend that’s taken place over decades. ""Basically, it’s just a statistical fluke that people have grabbed because it sounds good,"" Schmidt said. ""It has no relevance for the long-term trends.""   The drop in temperatures after 2016 was also unsurprising, climatologists said. 2016 was especially hot because it was at the peak of the last El Niño, a recurring event when the surface of the Pacific Ocean warms, leading to higher global average temperatures of a few tenths of a degree. As the event concluded, things cooled off. ""So the subsequent drop in temperature isn't surprising,"" said Judith Curry, a climatologist and former chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology. ""A two-year trend is not meaningful in terms of understanding anything about how climate is changing."" The Real Clear article is ostensibly a critique of the mainstream media’s failure to cover cold spells, which the author argues should garner as much coverage as heat waves and extreme weather phenomena linked to climate change. (""None of this argues against global warming,"" the author states.) Pletka said, ""We just had two of the coldest years, biggest drop in global temperatures that we have had since the 1980s, the biggest in the last 100 years."" Her claim that we just had two of the coldest years is wrong. Globally, 2016 and 2017 were the two warmest years on record, according to one measure. Climate scientists told us a two-year trend is meaningless in terms of understanding anything about how climate is changing. With that in mind, Pletka’s assertion that we’ve recently seen the biggest drop in global temperatures is a red herring. It’s based on a cherry-picked statistical fluke of no relevance, compared with long term trends. Bottom line: Cold spells can and do happen, but they do not negate the fact that global warming is real and a legitimate cause for concern, according to broad scientific consensus",False,"November 28, 2018"
"Says Texas U.S. Rep. John Culberson ""was caught using campaign cash on collectibles, including Civil War memorabilia and fossils.""","As the 2018 campaign comes to a close, the political arm of the Environmental Defense Fund has sent a mailer to homes in Texas’ 7th Congressional District saying that John Culberson, a Republican congressman, is ""wrong for Houston."" As partial proof, it said he was ""caught using campaign cash on collectibles, including Civil War memorabilia and fossils."" ""Caught"" is an interesting word, since the nine-term incumbent, now challenged by Democrat Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, disclosed the memorabilia purchases, which he says he gave as gifts from his campaign. As for the fossils, his campaign insisted there were no such purchases -- and said it only bought books and maps from a business that happens to also sell fossils. Critics have made a false assumption, the Culberson campaign told us initially. We’ll look at both parts of the claim but will give away a bit of what we found right here: He bought fossil replicas. If you wonder why an environment group would care about fossils and Culberson, the group noted that Culberson said in late summer that his purchases were for research into such things as paleoclimatology, or the study of climates before instrumental records were widely available, to help him better understand climate change. Environmental Defense Fund Action says that for all this studying, Culberson still refuses to accept scientific research on the matter. Culberson has said humans played a role in climate change but, as he told the Los Angeles Times in 2015,  ""We just don’t have enough data or accurate data to say with certainty what that effect has been."" Let’s take fossils first. The congressman’s critics based their claim on a mention in a 2012 campaign finance report that Culberson’s campaign made two purchases from a South Dakota organization, the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research. The institute sells fossils, replicas and other things, and Culberson spent $309.66 altogether there, Federal Election Commission records show. The purchase was part of a broader set of Culberson expenses being questioned by Texas Democrats -- a set of questions we are not addressing fully here because we are looking specifically at campaign ads and claims. But for a bit of perspective, the Houston Chronicle wrote in August that Texas Democrats were challenging nearly $50,000 in Culberson campaign spending since 2004. Focusing just on fossils, PolitiFact asked Culberson’s campaign what it bought from the Black Hills Institute. We were told it bought books and maps, not fossils, the same explanation the campaign has given since August. ""Only in politics does a person get attacked for trying to be better at their job,"" Culberson campaign spokeswoman Catherine Kelly said. ""The mailer from the Environmental Defense Action Fund is factually wrong. The congressman never bought fossils with campaign contributions and all other purchases are acceptable under House and FEC rules."" Culberson is a voracious reader, and has spent thousands of dollars from his campaign account for books and materials, including some on paleoclimatology, that his campaign says were related to his job. In just the 2011-12 campaign season, Culbserson’s campaign spent $9,848 on ""research"" or ""research materials,"" most of it from vendors such as Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble, FEC records reviewed by PolitiFact show. Culberson chairs the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees spending on science and such agencies as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The research material helps him better understand the changing levels of carbon dioxide in the climate, his campaign says. Asked about records that would show he was buying books and maps, not fossils, from the Black Hills Institute, his campaign said the 2012 records for such specific purchases no longer exist. PolitFact, however, called the Black Hills Institute. They pulled the invoices from Culberson's two separate orders and sent us copies. This is what the campaign paid for, excluding shipping charges: Three large wall charts showing extensive histories of the Earth and matter, dating back 4.5 billion years. The charts have columns showing tectonic maps, changes in the earth such as mountain formation, major volcanic eruptions, glacial epochs, craters from asteroids and comets and extensive information on fossils, invertebrates and vertebrate lifeforms, as well as their extinction. These cost $19.95 apiece. One desktop model of a Triceratops. It cost $84.05. Two large -- 4.5 inches -- fossil replicas of a Tyrannosaurus Rex tooth. Each cost $40. The FEC gives ""pretty wide latitude"" to the purchase of books and other materials that a candidate or officeholder might use in his or her official capacity, Brendan Fischer, an expert on campaign finance law at the Campaign Legal Center, told us. But what about a Triceratops model and replicas of a Tyrannosaurus Rex tooth fossil? ""I’d like to hear their explanation for it,"" he said. ""It’s hard to see how it would pertain to their official duties."" We told the campaign what we found, and it asked what our proof was. So we sent the campaign the invoices for the congressman’s purchases. The response from Kelly, the spokeswoman: ""The invoices confirm that the congressman never bought actual fossils, and every purchase from the Black Hills Institute is considered acceptable under House and FEC rules."" Asked why the congressman bought the replicas and the model at all, Kelly said, ""While these purchases were more than six years ago and now being used as part of a coordinated partisan hit job, the congressman believes these particular purchases were gifts, which is completely acceptable under FEC and House rules."" The mailer from Environmental Defense Fund Action also mentioned Culberson’s use of campaign money to buy collectibles and Civil War memorabilia. This, too, originated from the Democrats’ complaint referenced in the Houston Chronicle. Culberson is a Civil War history buff, collector and sometime-seller of memorabilia. But when it comes to his campaign funds, the purchases were for items such as stamps and coins the congressman got in order to give out as gifts, his campaign said. Congress members frequently use campaign money to buy gifts for constituents and volunteers, and the Culberson campaign said the Texas Republican was doing nothing different from what House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi has done when buying white orchids. The FEC allows candidates and officeholders to buy and give as gifts items of nominal value as long as they are not given to family members, Fischer said. FEC reports show only what a candidate or officeholder pays, not the value of the each item. For example, in 2014, Culberson’s campaign spent $3,631 on coins from an antique coin seller. In 2009 and 2010, the campaign spent $4,181 on antiques and coins for gifts, including hat stars  (an emblem worn on soldiers’ hats) and Texas Centennial and Republic of Texas coins, FEC records show. Culberson’s campaign said the value of each coin was about $25, and the value of stamps was about $10. For a broader view, we downloaded FEC data showing all federal candidate purchases -- those for everyone with a federal campaign account -- of items listed as ""gifts"" just since January 2017. The total reached $1.8 million, for everything from model airplanes to a quilt to gift baskets. Environmental Defense Fund Action said Texas U.S. Rep. John Culberson ""was caught using campaign cash on collectibles, including Civil War memorabilia and fossils."" ""Caught"" seemed strong to us at first, given the campaign’s denials. But with a phone call and email, it turned out that Culberson had in fact used campaign funds -- not for fossils, but for replicas and a desktop model. Our ruling comes down to perspective. The mailer’s spin seemed a little strong at first, especially knowing that gift purchases, whether for Civil War trinkets or not, are allowable if considered of nominal value. But the insistence of the campaign that Culberson did not buy fossils -- and that he had only bought books and maps -- is a factor as well. OK, he didn’t buy fossils. He bought fossil replicas",Mostly True,"November 3, 2018"
"""Puerto Rico’s electric grid and their electric generating plant was dead before the storms ever hit. It was in very bad shape. It was in bankruptcy. It had no money. It was largely -- you know, it was largely closed.""","As Hurricane Florence approached, President Donald Trump relied on his track record to assure the public his administration is ready. ""I think that Puerto Rico was an incredible, unsung success,"" Trump told reporters on Sept. 11. Puerto Rico recovered full power in August, 11 months after Hurricane Maria. Trump attributed the struggle to the territory’s floundering power system. ""Puerto Rico got hit not with one hurricane but with two (hurricanes),"" Trump said. ""And the problem with Puerto Rico is their electric grid and their electric generating plant was dead before the storms ever hit. It was in very bad shape. It was in bankruptcy. It had no money. It was largely — you know, it was largely closed."" ""And when the storm hit, they had no electricity — essentially before the storm,"" Trump said. ""And when the storm hit, that took it out entirely."" Was the power system dead on arrival? Trump is exaggerating. The White House pointed to the power grid’s state of disrepair. First, there’s a difference between the electric grid and generating plants. Plants produce electricity using fossil fuels or renewable energies, while the grid ensures that power gets to the areas that need it. Jorge Carmacho, a senior policy advisor at Urban Ingenuity who assessed the electric infrastructure damages after the hurricanes for the government of Puerto Rico, estimated roughly 30 percent of the generating plants were not operational before the storm hit. He identified two reasons. One is non-compliance with Environmental Protection Agency rules, which set limits on fossil fuel burning. The other was maintenance, propagated by unprecedented oversight by Puerto Rico’s recently created Energy Commission. One of the main issues they were trying to fix was the grid, which Trump also mentioned. It is run by PREPA, a government utilities program, which is bankrupt, as Trump said. It faces $9 billion of debt. Trump was right in saying it was in very bad shape. But it wasn’t dead or closed. Before the hurricanes hit, all customers were being serviced, according to James Gallagher, executive director of New York State Smart Grid Consortium, which is working to stabilize Puerto Rico’s grid. About 10 to 15 percent of customers lost power after the first hurricane, Irma. But coverage was spotty even before the hurricanes. In 2016, for example, a fire resulted in a three-day blackout. The consulting firm Synapse Energy Economics estimated that on average, customers face a power outage every three months. ""PREPA was in bankruptcy,"" Carmacho said. ""That’s true. But were they pushing electrons to people so they could turn on the lights? Yes. Was it reliable? No. it hasn’t been reliable in 20 years. We might have an outage every three days. That has been the norm."" The bulk of Puerto Rico’s generating plants are located in the southern part of the island, while consumption is mostly in the north. The complex system that transfers energy from one side to the other forms its Achilles heel during climate disasters like this one, according to Marla Perez Lugo, a sociologist at the University of Puerto Rico focusing on energy policy. Unlike in the United States, where an outage in Ohio can be fixed by connecting to the grid in Illinois, an island electric system relies on reserves, on which Puerto Rico falls short, according to Carmacho. Trump said ""Puerto Rico’s electric grid and their electric generating plant was dead before the storms ever hit. It was in very bad shape. It was in bankruptcy. It had no money. It was largely -- you know, it was largely closed."" Some electric generating plants, not the majority, were inoperative before the storm hit due to maintenance work. The grid was servicing all customers but had important vulnerabilities. Trump's statement is partially accurate",Half True,"September 13, 2018"
"Studies are showing California’s wildfires ""are producing more emissions than all of our cars are doing.""","Wildfires have ravaged California again this year, destroying hundreds of homes and killing six firefighters, as well as several residents. This year also produced the largest single fire in California’s history, the Ranch Fire, which had burned more than 400,000 acres and spread across four counties near the Mendocino National Forest as of late August. Smoke up and down the state, for days at a time, has blanketed metro areas miles from the fires, raising worries about air quality and pollution. The wildfires have led some, including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, to claim the blazes are spewing out more pollution than the state’s millions of vehicles. ""I have a real concern about air quality because of where I come from,"" McCarthy, a Republican who represents the southern San Joaquin Valley, including Bakersfield, said during a speech in Sacramento on Aug. 15, 2018. ""(We’re at the) bottom of all the mountains and we collect (air pollution) all the way from San Francisco."" ""What I have found, because of these fires, there are studies that are showing they are producing more emissions than all of our cars are doing,"" he added.  SOURCE: Public Policy Institute of California Was McCarthy right? We decided to fact-check his wildfires-versus-cars comparison. Our research Sean Raffuse, an analyst at the UC Davis Air Quality Research Center, told us McCarthy’s statement is correct, but for only for one category of emissions — particulate matter. The claim is not true, however, for climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions, he said. Cars still produce far more of those. Particulate matter, or PM, is a mixture of microscopic particles and liquid droplets that, when inhaled, can affect the heart and lungs and cause serious health problems. For months, officials have issued health warnings that particulate matter from the wildfires could trigger asthma attacks or aggravate chronic heart and lung diseases. Specifically, Raffuse said, the fires produce more PM 2.5 than all cars. PM 2.5 refers to particles two and one half microns or less in width, or about thirty times smaller than that of a human hair. ""PM 2.5 emissions are greater than what we see from cars, and that’s typical, not just of California during the wildfire season,"" he said, ""but even if you look overall at the nation for an entire year, there will be more emissions from particles from wildfires than there will be from motor vehicles."" Clean combustion regulations, he said, are one reason vehicles produce fewer particulate matter than fires. Earlier this month, the Trump administration proposed rules that would ease vehicle emissions standards nationwide. The proposal would also challenge the right of states, California in particular, to set their own, more stringent tailpipe pollution standards. Greenhouse gas emissions Bill Stewart, a researcher at the UC Berkeley Center for Forestry, said there’s a key point missing from McCarthy’s statement. While fires emit more particulate matter, cars produce far more greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide, he said. ""Those are two important but different issues,"" Stewart said. Mike Kleeman, a UC Davis professor of environmental engineering, added that wildfires also emit some greenhouse gases. ""But burned areas also regrow during which time they act as a net carbon sink.  Assuming a burned area regrows completely over a time of decades, the net CO2 emissions should be low,"" Kleeman wrote in an email. ""Wildfires are a problem,"" he added, ""and we should be taking steps to reduce their frequency and intensity. But it isn't an ‘apples to apples’ comparison to an every-day source like cars."" McCarthy’s response Asked for evidence supporting the claim, McCarthy’s spokesman pointed to an October 2017 NBC News story that examined the emissions produced by that year’s deadly Wine Country fires. The story had the misleading headline: ""California Wildfires Emitted a Year's Worth of Car Pollution in Less Than a Week."" It quoted Raffuse of UC Davis, who told NBC the fires had released the same amount of particulate matter as come from California vehicles in one year. He didn’t claim the fires had produced more of all types of emissions than cars. In the article, the researcher ""pointed out cars pollute in other ways, too."" Raffuse summed up the congressman’s statement saying it’s ""partially correct but omits a key distinction."" McCarthy’s spokesman did not cite any specific studies to support the claim. We reviewed several that described wildfire emissions as a growing concern, but did not say they produce more pollution overall compared with cars. One such report by the Sierra Nevada Conservancy in 2014 found that by the year 2085, emissions from wildfires are projected to be equal to the annual emissions of about one fifth of all of the cars currently registered in California. Our ruling House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy recently claimed ""because of these fires, there are studies that are showing they are producing more emissions than all of our cars are doing."" Wildfires produce more of one key pollutant, particulate matter, than cars, both in California and nationwide. But that’s all. McCarthy cherry-picked this one category and ignored the fact that cars produce far more greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide, than fires",Half True,"August 29, 2018"
Says May 2018 marked the 401st straight month of global temperatures exceeding the 20th century average.,"A reader inquired about an Austin weathercaster saying the planet has sweltered through hundreds of months of consecutive record temperatures. ""Last week, Jim Spencer said during his weather forecast that record-breaking heat has been going on for over 400 months,"" the reader said by email. KXAN-TV’s Spencer, the reader said, had called April 2018 the 400th straight month with global temperatures above the 20th century average and that when May data was official, that would mark month 401, the reader said. We didn’t track down such a broadcast. But when we asked Spencer about making the statement, he pointed by email to his June 18, 2018, blog post stating that May 2018 ""marks the 42nd consecutive May and the 401st consecutive month with"" global land and ocean ""temperatures, at least nominally, above the 20th century average."" All those months? We launched this fact-check. NOAA conclusion Spencer told us he relied on information posted online the day of his post by the National Centers for Environmental Information, which is in the authoritative National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. According to the centers, the report, ""Assessing the Global Climate in May 2018,"" was developed by its scientists as ""part of the suite of climate services NOAA provides to government, business, academia and the public to support informed decision-making."" In May 2018, the assessment states, Earth’s temperature across global land and ocean surfaces ran 1.44 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average of 58.6 degrees Fahrenheit. The report also says: ""The years 2014-2018 rank among the five warmest Mays on record, with 2016 the warmest May at 1.58°F above average. May 2018 also marks the 42nd consecutive May and the 401st consecutive month with temperatures, at least nominally, above the 20th century average,"" the report states. That 20th century average, USA Today said in a May 2018 news story, serves climate scientists as a benchmark for global temperature measurements. That's because it's fixed in time, the story said, ""allowing for consistent ‘goal posts’ when reviewing climate data. It's also a sufficiently long period to include several cycles of climate variability."" Land temperatures alone, the centers’ assessment says, ran 2.05 degrees Fahrenheit above the comparable 20th century average of 52 degrees Fahrenheit. In May 2018, the report says, record ""warmth was observed across parts of North America, Europe and Asia as well as the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. Record cold May temperatures were limited to northeastern Canada and the northern Atlantic Ocean, off the southern coast of Greenland."" An accompanying text box says: ""As a whole, North America had its highest May temperature since 1998 and the second highest since continental records began in 1910. The contiguous U.S. had its warmest May since records began in 1895."" State climatologist For another perspective, we asked John Nielsen-Gammon, the Texas state climatologist based at Texas A&M University, about Spencer’s citation of the global temperature analysis. By email, Nielsen-Gammon credited Spencer with accurately rendering NOAA’s 401-month finding though he also noted that other researchers analyze changes in temperature over time, reaching varied consecutive-month conclusions. Nielsen-Gammon said that in response to our inquiry he checked several other analyses. ""NOAA happens to have the longest streak of temperatures above the 20th century average, which may be why that particular statistic seems to be quoted most often with the NOAA data,"" Nielsen-Gammon wrote. The climatologist said other analysts reported ongoing streaks ranging from 399 months per figures compiled by British researchers to as few as 291 months, according to figures analyzed by Berkeley Earth, a California-based nonprofit. ""So speaking scientifically, it has almost certainly been at least 291 consecutive months of global temperatures above the 20th century mean, and probably much longer, with 399 or 401 months being the best estimates,"" Nielsen-Gammon said. ""If you believe the NOAA estimate, it's 401 months."" Nielsen-Gammon elaborated: ""What this means is that average global temperatures have increased so much that not even natural variability can produce a month colder than the 20th century average, and hasn't been able to do so for some time. The global warming signal is well above the noise level. At this rate, about the only thing strong enough to cancel out global warming for a month would be a volcanic eruption much stronger than Krakatau."" Federal official reaffirms 401-month mark We also heard back by email from Derek ""Deke"" Arndt of the NCEI, who reaffirmed its 401-month finding which, he said, traces to the NOAA Merged Land Ocean Global Surface Temperature Analysis Dataset containing monthly readings all the way back to January 1880. Asked why other researchers have indicated fewer months of global temperatures exceeding the 20th-century average, Arndt said he believes those others draw on different datasets. We also alerted Spencer to the alternate findings of fewer months in a row when the planet’s temperature outpaced the 20th-century average. By email, Spencer noted that Nielsen-Gammon described 399 or 401 months as the best estimates. Our ruling Spencer wrote that May 2018 marked the 401st straight month of global temperatures exceeding the 20th century average. This claim accurately echoes the findings of respected NOAA researchers.

"""You’re going to have an increase in the amount of ice in Antarctica because of global warming.""","It’s not every day that a hearing of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee goes viral, but that’s what happened on May 16, 2018, when a Republican lawmaker questioned aspects of climate change. The most frequently shared exchange from the hearing involved Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., and a witness, Phil Duffy, the president and executive director of the Woods Hole Research Center. At one point, Brooks suggested that England’s White Cliffs of Dover and the California coastline are continually eaten away by erosion, perhaps driving a rise in sea levels that scientists ordinarily blame on melting ice. Others have debunked the idea that cliff erosion or sediment release from rivers constitutes a significant factor in sea level rise. (Philip Bump at the Washington Post estimated the current annual sea level increase of 3.3 millimeters would require, every year, ""a volume of earth equivalent to taking the top five inches of every one of the United States’ 9.1 million square miles of land area and using it to coat the bottom of the world’s oceans."") So we won’t go over the same territory. Instead, we decided to look at another comment from Brooks’ exchange with Duffy: Brooks: ""Would it surprise you to know that if global temperatures rise, assuming for the moment that they do, that that actually increases the amount of ice that is collected on Antarctica?"" Duffy: ""That’s not true, sir."" Brooks: ""I made a trip down to Antarctica and met with National Science Foundation scientists, and they all agreed with global warming, and they emphasize that you’re going to have an increase in the amount of ice in Antarctica because of global warming.… ""Do you understand that as temperatures rise, more moisture is contained in the atmosphere and then that moisture in Antarctica collects on land, and it takes hundreds and hundreds of years for that ice that is deposited on Antarctica to actually ever reach the shoreline where it touches the oceans where it can affect in some way sea level increases?"" Is it true, as Brooks said, that ""you’re going to have an increase in the amount of ice in Antarctica because of global warming""? In a statement to PolitiFact, Brooks reiterated what he said he learned from the scientists in Antarctica, including those who believe that global warming is real. The increase in interior ice, he said the scientists told him, should ""offset the loss of Antarctic sea ice, Arctic sea ice, and whatever melting occurs in places like Greenland."" (Read Brooks’ full statement here,) However, more than a dozen scientists told PolitiFact that while Brooks is correctly describing one part of the complicated interplay around Antarctic climate change, whatever ice gains materialize from this process are almost certain to be overwhelmed by melting ice that he’s overlooking. What Brooks said ""is like talking about the money in your bank account by only looking at deposits and ignoring withdrawals,"" said Gary T. Mitchum, a professor and associate dean at the University of South Florida College of Marine Science. ""It’s just flawed. I sure wish I could get away with this at my bank."" How could ice increase due to global warming? It stems from the tendency for a warmer climate to produce more precipitation. In the context of Antarctica, this means increased amounts of frozen precipitation. ""On the whole, the amount of precipitation increases in the coldest climates as they warm,"" said John Nielsen-Gammon, a Texas A&M University atmospheric sciences professor. ""This comes about because the amount of moisture the atmosphere can hold -- and thus deliver as snow -- increases dramatically as the temperature warms."" In fact, there’s already evidence of this occurring in certain parts of Antarctica. One paper documenting this was written by Jay Zwally, a glaciologist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in 2015. He found significant increases in ice in eastern Antarctica. Zwally is considered a credible scientist, but other scientists said his methodology in the study is not foolproof. Critics suggest that much of the increase Zwally measured may be coming from additional snow rather than ice. Because ice contains more water than snow does, an increase in snow rather than ice would mean that Antarctica isn’t taking as much water out of circulation as the paper suggests. Indeed, a study using a different method, headed by Alba Martin-Español of the University of Bristol in England, concluded that the ice gains in eastern Antarctica were only about one-third as large as Zwally had found. An even more important point is that any ice gains need to be measured against losses elsewhere. To look only at the ice gains, as Brooks did, amounts to cherry picking. ""The important thing for science and policy is whether there's a net gain or loss of ice on Antarctica"" from all sources, Nielsen-Gammon said. Scientists we checked with agreed that, while Antarctica’s increased banking of water through precipitation is a real phenomenon, it pales in comparison with the amount of water being lost through melting. Basically, the continent may be adding ice in one place, but it’s losing a larger amount elsewhere due to melting, evaporation, or glaciers falling into the sea. ""Rep. Brooks is correct that one may expect an increase in precipitation in a warmer climate,"" said Justin C. Burton, a physicist at Emory University. ""However, this is a small feedback effect compared to melting from a warmer climate, and especially a warmer ocean."" For the past few decades, most scientific studies have shown that the net change in ice has produced shrinkage overall, not expansion, said Ted Scambos, a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado. In western Antarctica, Scientific American has reported, ""the floating platforms of ice that ring the coast are thinning, glaciers are surging toward the sea, meltwater is flowing across the surface, fast-growing moss is turning the once shimmering landscape green, and a massive iceberg the size of Delaware broke off into the ocean in July of 2017."" ""The near unanimous view is that the net effect, by a pretty big margin, would be melting,"" said John Reilly, co-director of the joint program on the science and policy of global change at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The fear, he said, is that ice ""will break loose and float out, raising sea level and in turn reduce the friction holding back ice on shore, which will then flow faster into the ocean."" Given this degree of melting, Scambos said, the likeliest impact from the increased snowfall that Brooks is pointing to would be to ""slow the pace of ice loss slightly,"" Scambos said. ""Greenland, which is somewhat more impacted by climate change, has not shown enough increase in precipitation to offset the very large peripheral losses in the past few decades."" Even beyond melting, sea level is increasing as the temperature warms because when water gets warmer, it expands. It’s worth noting that the net change in sea level has zig-zagged a bit. In 2011, for instance, it fell, prompting some to suggest an end to the problem. However, sea levels soon started rising again. Such blips are ""common,"" said Gary Griggs, an earth sciences professor at the University of California-Santa Cruz. ""There are year to year variations, but the overall trend is clear."" All told, ""the vast majority of scientists agree that a warming climate will most certainly lead to a net ice loss from Antarctica,"" Burton said. ""The question is really how much and how fast?"" Brooks said, ""You’re going to have an increase in the amount of ice in Antarctica because of global warming."" Scientists agree that parts of Antarctica may already be seeing higher levels of frozen precipitation due to global warming. However, focusing on this increase amounts to cherry-picking, because the same higher temperatures also mean faster melting of existing Antarctic ice. On balance, scientists expect the amount of ice lost from added melting to be much higher than the amount of ice added from greater precipitation",Mostly False,"May 21, 2018"
"""The ice caps were going to melt, they were going to be gone by now, but now they’re setting records, so okay, they’re at a record level.""","President Donald Trump, who once called climate change a hoax spread by China, downplayed concerns about global temperature trends in an interview with Piers Morgan. Morgan asked Trump if he believed that climate change exists. ""There is a cooling and there is a heating and I mean, look – it used to not be climate change – it used to be global warming,"" Trump said in an interview broadcast Jan. 26. ""That wasn’t working too well, because it was getting too cold all over the place. The ice caps were going to melt, they were going to be gone by now, but now they’re setting records, so okay, they’re at a record level."" We looked at what’s been going on with the polar ice. Trump is wrong that the ice caps are at record levels. In March 2017, NASA published a news brief with the headline, ""Sea Ice Extent Sinks to Record Lows at Both Poles."" Researcher Julienne Stroeve with the National Snow and Ice Data Center said Trump’s claim was ""odd."" Stroeve said polar ice is at ""a record low in the Arctic (around the North Pole) right now and near record low in the Antarctic (around the South Pole)."" The National Snow and Ice Data Center gathers data under contracts with NASA, the National Science Foundation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. For both the Arctic and Antarctic ice caps, the extent of the ice is down from the 30-year average. The key difference between the two polar zones is that the levels have bounced around more in Antarctica. This chart, based on National Snow and Ice Data Center numbers, shows the yearly averages back to 1979. In no way are the ice caps at record highs. Physicist Kent Moore at the University of Toronto said the satellite record going back to 1979 is well validated and reliable. For the Arctic ice certainly, but also broadly for the Antarctic too, Moore said ""there is variability from year to year but the long-term trend is downwards."" Moore did note though that some climate models are predicting a slower rate of loss than scientists have seen in the past. The White House press office pointed to a 2015 NASA report that found ice was forming in parts of Antarctica at a faster rate than it was being lost in other areas of the continent. In other words, there was a net increase in the ice mass on the continent. But a full reading of the report showed that the gains were slowing down and researchers said that in 20 to 30 years, losses would outstrip gains. We note that the study is not directly comparable to other data because it measures the ice in tons, while historically, researchers have tracked how far the ice is spread out, that is, its area, not its weight. Moore and Stroeve said the area measurements are more reliable because the observational data has been gathered over many decades. More accurate volume measurements have only recently come on line. Moore said recent work at the University of Washington suggests that even in terms of volume, the amount of polar ice has been falling. Trump said that the ice caps are at record levels. They are not. The numbers show that the extent of the ice at both poles is smaller than it was decades ago. The shrinkage is more striking in the Arctic, but the overall trend is downward at both ends of the earth. By no means are the ice caps at record high levels",False Pants on Fire,"January 29, 2018"
"""BUSTED: NASA Accidentally destroys every climate change advocate by exposing massive truth behind Antarctica.""","The public has been misled by climate change advocates about the real reason behind the melting of Antarctica’s western ice sheet, claims the website American News. ""BUSTED: NASA Accidentally destroys every climate change advocate by exposing massive truth behind Antarctica,"" states a Nov. 8 headline. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially misleading, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We emailed American News but did not get a reply. The American News story refers to a real study by NASA, but the headline falsely suggests that the study debunks climate change advocates. A NASA scientist involved in the study told us the headline is inaccurate. Here’s the real story: On Nov. 7, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., issued a summary of the study about the heat source under West Antarctica. The paper, ""Influence of a West Antarctic mantle plume on ice sheet basal conditions,"" was published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth. According to the NASA press release, the study ""adds evidence that a geothermal heat source called a mantle plume lies deep below Antarctic Marie Byrd Land, explaining some of the melting that creates lakes and rivers under the ice sheet."" The heat source isn’t new or increasing, but may help explain why the ice sheet collapsed so rapidly in an earlier area of climate change and remains unstable. Some 30 years ago, a scientist at the University of Colorado Denver suggested that heat from a mantle plume under Marie Byrd Land might explain regional volcanic activity and a topographic dome feature, NASA wrote. Recent seismic imaging has supported this concept. The American News story used an actual quote from the NASA press release by the first author of the study, Hélène Seroussi. When she first heard the idea, she said, ""I thought it was crazy. I didn't see how we could have that amount of heat and still have ice on top of it."" To study the concept, NASA scientists used a numerical depiction of the physics of ice sheets  to capture natural sources of heating and heat transport from freezing, melting and liquid water; friction; and other processes. Mantle plumes are thought to be narrow streams of hot rock rising through Earth's mantle and spreading out like a mushroom cap under the crust, NASA wrote. The Marie Byrd Land mantle plume formed 50 million to 110 million years ago, long before the West Antarctic ice sheet came into existence, NASA wrote. ""At the end of the last ice age around 11,000 years ago, the ice sheet went through a period of rapid, sustained ice loss when changes in global weather patterns and rising sea levels pushed warm water closer to the ice sheet -- just as is happening today,"" NASA said. Erik Ivins, a scientist and the second author on the study, told PolitiFact that the study didn’t address climate change. ""The study itself is about steady state conditions that would exist at the bottom of the ice sheet for many many millions of years,"" he said. ""We think of climate change as occurring 10 years, 100 years, maybe 500 years -- our study has nothing to do with those time scales."" The NASA study is about the bottom of the ice sheet. Climate change has had an impact on the top of the ice sheet. Warmer ocean waters intruding on the ice shelf causes the ice shelves to break up. When grounded ice sheets exit the land and go into the water that causes sea level rise ""This study doesn’t discredit that,"" he says. ""Nothing in our paper has anything to do with climate change."" We interviewed a few experts on climate change including Ben Strauss, vice president for sea level and climate impacts at Climate Central, a news organization that focuses on climate change. ""It merely suggests the presence of a natural contributor to West Antarctic ice sheet melt and instability,"" he says. ""It does not prove that this is the only factor. It does not state that it explains all of West Antarctic mass loss. Saying that a natural heat source disproves any effect of human-caused climate change is just as ridiculous as saying that natural moonlight disproves illumination from a streetlamp.""

The story refers to a real study by NASA about Antarctica, but that study doesn’t discredit climate change scientists",False,"November 20, 2017"
"""30,000 scientists have come forward confirming that man-made climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the elite in order to make money.""","Climate change doubters have no patience for claims that the overwhelming number of climate researchers believe that humans are the driving factor. Facebook users flagged a recent article on the website News Punch that asserted much more disagreement in the scientific community than is commonly thought. ""30,000 scientists have come forward confirming that man-made climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the elite in order to make money,"" was the subheadline in the Sept. 2 story. That striking number of dissenting scientists has been around for many years and dates back to a 1998 petition drive conducted under the auspices of a climate change skeptic named Arthur Robinson. Robinson is a biochemist, conservative activist and four-time Republican congressional candidate in Oregon. Robinson believes human-driven climate change is a myth. Robinson’s Petition Project now counts 31,487 signatories. Before we get to who those people are, the key flaw in the News Punch statement is that the petition doesn’t say what the article claims. Here’s what people sign:  For the purposes of this fact-check, the key sentence is, ""There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth’s atmosphere and disruption of the Earth’s climate."" The petition says nothing about hoaxes or profit motives. On its face, someone signing the petition need not believe that climate change is a hoax, nor that it has been perpetrated to make money. While some or even many who signed it might hold those beliefs, the petition itself doesn’t speak to either of those conditions. In terms of the mindset of the signers, the statement relies on speculation. There are many reasons to question what it means to have over 31,000 people signing this petition. First of all, the meaning of ""scientist"" is vague. The minimum requirement is a bachelor’s of science degree. That’s no guarantee that the person studied a science related to climate change, or that the person pursued a career in science. The petition’s website says that 12,715 signers hold ""BS or equivalent academic degrees."" When we look at the number of people with some sort of background in fields that tie directly to climate change, the petition website said, ""there are 3,805 scientists trained in specialties directly related to the physical environment of the Earth."" That would be about 12 percent of the total. There are, according to the site, 9,029 people with PhDs, which comes closer to meeting a higher bar for being thought of as a scientist. Based on the site’s figures, most of them don’t specialize in climate change, but they likely are more familiar with scientific methods. These important nuances get lost. A 2012 opinion piece in Forbes described the signers as ""more than 31,000 American scientists from diverse climate-related disciplines."" That’s way off the mark, unless you count veterinarians -- one of the degrees that qualifies you as a scientist in the petition project -- and physicians. We also don’t know much about when people signed the petition. The website tells us that thousands of signatures came in 1998 and 1999 when the petition was first circulated. It also says, ""The majority of the current listed signatories signed or re-signed the petition after October 2007."" The problem is, the scientific consensus on mankind’s role in climate change has grown over time. Even if more than half of the signers came after that date, it doesn’t mean that those who came before remain skeptical of climate change. There’s reason to think that opinions can shift. When the magazine Scientific American reached out to a random sample of 30 names on the list in 2006, it found ""six said they would not sign the petition today, three did not remember any such petition, one had died, and five did not answer."" We reached out to the publishers of News Punch and did not hear back. An article on the News Punch website said that ""30,000 scientists have come forward confirming that man-made climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the elite in order to make money."" The source is a well-known petition project. The key flaw is that the petition challenges the science, but it doesn’t cast human-driven climate change as a hoax aimed at making some people rich. That is pure interpretation by the website. The use of the word ""scientists"" is misleading, since a signatory need not be a scientist today and need not have done more than earned a bachelor of science degree in any field. The actual number of climate-related specialists is about 12 percent of the total. And these are not currently confirmed signatories as the list has been circulating since 1998",False Pants on Fire,"September 8, 2017"
"""Most likely the primary control knob (for the earth’s temperature) is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in.""","Energy Secretary Rick Perry downplayed the role of human activity in the recent rise in the Earth’s temperature, saying natural causes are likely the main driver of climate change. Perry was asked in a CNBC interview if he believed carbon dioxide was the ""primary control knob"" for the earth’s temperature. ""No. Most likely the primary control knob is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in,"" Perry said in the June 19 interview. We decided to investigate Perry’s claim about climate change’s main cause, which scientists have likened to a ""control knob."" Perry’s claim flies in the face of settled science. The world’s leading authority on climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has concluded that human activity is ""extremely likely"" to be the main driver of warming since the mid 20th century. While it’s still possible to find dissenters, scientists around the globe generally agree with this conclusion. The graph below, based on work by NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, shows just how closely human activity syncs with the earth’s rising temperature, especially since 1950. The blue line shows how human factors (land use, ozone, aerosols and greenhouse gases) have contributed to global warming. The black line is the Earth’s recorded temperature since 1880.  This is not to say natural factors don’t affect the climate. They do. But Perry is wrong to call them the main cause of the earth’s rising temperature. When you look at how natural causes (orbital and solar changes plus volcanic activity) have contributed to climate change, it’s clear the impact is less than that of human factors.  Perry is also wrong to say ocean waters are responsible for the uptick in temperature. While oceans are a vital part of the climate system, and variations in their circulation can affect local climates in important ways, they don’t account for global warming, said Gavin Schmidt, climatologist and director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. ""We have concluded close to all of the recent trends in global temperature is due to human activity, and CO2 is the dominant factor,"" Schmidt said, referring to carbon dioxide.

"""A study by the National Economics Research Association showed that the (Paris climate) deal could cost 2.7 million lost jobs in the U.S. by 2025 should our country adhere to the commitments made by the Obama Administration.""","U.S. Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Palm Harbor, defended the president’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement, claiming it would save millions of jobs in a letter to constituents. ""A study by the National Economics Research Association showed that the deal could cost 2.7 million lost jobs in the U.S. by 2025 should our country adhere to the commitments made by the Obama Administration,"" Bilirakis said. A reader who received the letter asked us to look into it. Would the United States have lost 2.7 million jobs had it remained in the agreement? This is a statistic President Donald Trump also cited in his speech declaring the withdrawal, but we found that the study is based on an extreme model, and its results were presented in a misleading way. Bilirakis’ office directed us to Trump’s announcement to withdraw from the Paris accord, citing the same study. But when we asked NERA about it, the organization forwarded the same statement they put out following Trump’s speech. ""Use of results from this analysis as estimates of the impact of the Paris Agreement alone mischaracterizes the purpose of NERA’s analysis, which was to explore the challenges of achieving reductions from U.S. industrial sectors over a longer term,"" it states. ""Selective use of results from a single implementation scenario and a single year compounds the mischaracterization."" Here’s why plucking the 2.7 million-lost jobs talking point is a bad idea. The study predicts the potential impact of hypothetical U.S. regulatory action to meet the carbon emission goals pledged in Paris. It was produced in March 2017 and funded by the American Council for Capital Formation and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, both vocal opponents of the agreement. The loss of 2.7 million jobs economy-wide by 2025 reported in the study is contingent on ""additional regulatory actions necessary to meet the Paris target."" But the Paris agreement does not require actions, as it was not binding, and the regulatory action mentioned has not been proposed. The study begins, then, with the assumption that regulation would expand beyond the electricity sector, which is where the Obama administration directed it. According to law professor Cary Coglianese, the director of the University of Pennsylvania Program on Regulation and author of Does Regulation Kill Jobs?, the study is a forecast based on an erroneous model. ""How accurate that forecast or any forecast will be depends upon how well the model matches reality and the world. The particular model used in that NERA analysis doesn’t match up with what I think most people would recognize as the reality of the economy,"" Coglianese said. According to Gary Yohe, a professor of economics and environmental studies at Wesleyan University who worked on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that received a share of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, the model does not accurately reflect government regulation or the energy industry’s reaction to market trends. ""They impose what they interpret as the effect of what the Unites States agreed to under the Paris accord,"" Yohe said, but ""they pick the least efficient way of doing it."" The hypothetical regulations they impose are inflexible, ruling out cap-and-trade or taxes and instead set strict regulations on specific sectors. The NERA researchers acknowledged the risk of their predictions. ""The findings contained in this report may contain projections based on current data and historical trends,"" the report states. ""Actual results could be impacted by future events that cannot be predicted or controlled, including, without limitation, changes in business strategies, the development of future products and services, changes in market and industry conditions, the outcome of contingencies, changes in management, and changes in law or regulations."" The development of future products and services, though, is precisely what the renewable energy industry is all about. But the study assumes the economy and technology will remain unchanged. ""There’s no inclusion in the analysis of the growth or development of renewable energy sources, for example,"" Coglianese said. ""And one thing we know about jobs, renewable energy sources tend to result in hiring of more people and more jobs than in other parts of the energy sector."" ""According to the U.S. Energy and Employment Report designed by the Energy Information Administration, over 373,000 Americans were employed in solar energy, while the coal industry employed about 160,000 and continued to shrink since 2012 due, in part, to competition by natural gas. So while the quote in the NERA study seems to conflate job loss with unemployment, it ignores the possibility of a changing job market in which jobs in the renewable energy industry replace jobs in the traditional fossil fuel industry that would face heavier regulation to comply with the agreement. Our ruling Bilirakis said that the Paris accord could cost the United States 2.7 million jobs by 2025, citing a NERA study that presented this projection. But the study is unreliable, using an extreme model that does not consider the possible benefits of carbon regulation and rules out investment, flexibility or technology that would lead to more jobs. And as NERA itself stated, the study was not designed as a cost-benefit analysis of the Paris accord",False,"June 21, 2017"
"Says each of the past three years ""has been the hottest on record.""","A Democrat hot after the U.S. House seat held by Republican climate-science skeptic Lamar Smith made a searing claim while strolling for support in South Austin, a news story shows. After a resident told candidate Derrick Crowe she’s worried about climate change, Crowe responded: ""That one actually keeps me up at night."" Crowe went on: ""I have a 3-year-old, Henry, and every year he’s lived has been the hottest on record."" Has each of the past three years proved the hottest on record? Candidate cites federal agency Crowe, described as a climate justice organizer in the June 3, 2017, Austin American-Statesman news story, responded to our request for factual backup for his claim by pointing out by email a Jan. 18, 2017, web post by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration headlined: ""2016 marks three consecutive years of record warmth for the globe."" NOAA’s post said ""the 2016 globally averaged surface temperature ended as the highest since record keeping began in 1880, according to scientists from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)."" The agency further said: ""The average temperature across global land and ocean surfaces in 2016 was 58.69 degrees F or 1.69 degrees F above the 20th century average. This surpassed last year’s record by 0.07 degrees F. Since the start of the 21st century, the annual global temperature record has been broken five times (2005, 2010, 2014, 2015, and 2016)."" That’s three straight years of record average land-ocean-surface temperatures. That day, NASA announced a similar conclusion. In its post, the space agency said: ""Globally-averaged temperatures in 2016 were 1.78 degrees Fahrenheit (0.99 degrees Celsius) warmer than the mid-20th century mean. This makes 2016 the third year in a row to set a new record for global average surface temperatures."" The space agency elaborated: ""NASA's analyses incorporate surface temperature measurements from 6,300 weather stations, ship- and buoy-based observations of sea surface temperatures, and temperature measurements from Antarctic research stations. These raw measurements are analyzed using an algorithm that considers the varied spacing of temperature stations around the globe and urban heating effects that could skew the conclusions. The result of these calculations is an estimate of the global average temperature difference from a baseline period of 1951 to 1980. ""NOAA scientists used much of the same raw temperature data,"" NASA said, ""but with a different baseline period, and different methods to analyze Earth's polar regions and global temperatures."" News stories News stories posted that day by The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal each indicated scientific consensus that each of the years was the hottest in the history of  the temperature measurements. The Times’ account said 2016 marked ""the first time in the modern era of global warming data that temperatures have blown past the previous record three years in a row."" In 2015 and 2016, the newspaper reported, planetary warming was intensified by the weather pattern known as El Niño, in which the Pacific Ocean released a huge burst of energy and water vapor into the atmosphere. But the bigger factor in setting the records was the long-term trend of rising temperatures, the story said, which scientists say is being driven by increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. A British agency aired a similar conclusion, the story said. ""In the British data set,"" the story said, ""2016 set a record by only a small amount; the margin was larger in the NOAA data set and larger still in NASA’s. NASA does more work than the other groups to take full account of Arctic temperatures,"" the story said, ""and several scientists said they believed the NASA record to be the most accurate for 2016."" Then again, the story said, the Berkeley Earth surface temperature project, a nonprofit California group set up to provide a temperature analysis independent of governments, did not find that three records had been set in a row; in its analysis, 2010 was slightly warmer than 2014. The Journal’s news story on 2016 proving the hottest year on record noted three other independent assessments of the year’s warming trend. The Japan Meteorological Agency, which uses slightly different methods in its calculations, had just ranked 2016 as the warmest in its modern record, the story said, while separately researchers at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, drawing on satellite data to track global atmospheric temperatures, concluded that by a very small statistical margin, 2016 was the warmest year in 38 years of orbital monitoring. The Journal story said the same week that NOAA and NASA piped up, scientists at the U.K.’s Met Office Hadley Centre and the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit reported that by their analysis, 2016 was fractionally warmer than any other year in its record keeping, barely edging out 2015. State climate experts For our part, we asked experts including the respective state climatologists for Florida and Texas--big states on the Gulf of Mexico--to evaluate Crowe’s claim. David Zierden of the Florida Climate Center and John Nielsen-Gammon of Texas A&M University each cited the conclusion that global average surface temperatures in 2016 set a record high--just as record highs were reached in 2014 and 2015. By email, Katharine Hayhoe, director of the Climate Center at Texas Tech University, and Clare Nullis, a spokeswoman for the World Meteorological Organization, a United Nations agency, each concurred. Zierden filled us in on how the averages cited by NASA and NOAA are reached, saying that each weather station’s overnight low and day-time high ultimately contributes toward year-long planet-spanning averages. ""It’s not necessarily a great measure of our climate system,"" Zierden said, but it’s a simple way of showing long-term trends. Focusing on global averaged temperatures, he added by email, reduces ""an infinitely complicated climate system, which includes the atmosphere (all levels), oceans, land surfaces, and ice surfaces, to ONE number per month or year is quite an oversimplification."" Warmth of U.S., Texas Crowe didn’t limit his hottest-ever statement to the U.S. or Texas. But the Journal story, citing NOAA, said that in the 48 states of the continental U.S., 2016 was the second-hottest year in record keeping, marking 20 years in a row when temperatures were above average. With help from the state climatologists, we clicked to the NOAA’s NCEI website and obtained a ranking, from 1901 through 2016, of the average surface temperature in the 48 states in the continental U.S. Results: The average 2016 surface temperature of 54.91 degrees F was exceeded by the 55.28 degrees F average in 2012 with the continental U.S.’s 2015 average temperature of 54.40 degrees F ranking third since 1901. The continental U.S.’s 2014 surface temperature average, 54.52.54 degrees F, made that year its 37th warmest, according to NOAA. In Texas, according to the site, 2016 tied 2006 for the third-warmest average surface temperatures on record of 67.1 degrees F. Also not record-setting: The state’s averages for 2014 (the state’s 56th warmest year since 1901) and 2015 (the state’s 16th-warmest year since 1901). Our ruling Crowe said each of the past three years was the ""hottest on record.""

"""Every single year that there's an increase (in temperature) it's within the margin of error -- meaning it isn't increasing.""","Fox News’ Greg Gutfeld says people who cite statistics about the hottest year ever or high temperatures are spreading ""B.S."" He says people who make such claims are not telling the full story about temperature statistics. ""If you asked them what the increase was, they wouldn't be able to tell you that every single year that there's an increase, it is within the margin of error, meaning it isn’t increasing,"" Gutfeld said June 2 on the show he co-hosts, The Five. ""So, those are called real truths,"" he continued. ""The poetic truth is the chaos and the hysteria, because that plays to the media. And it makes you feel so important. And you get to punish America for being so successful by doing these stupid deals. But if you read the facts about the high temperatures, about the reality of our past, it is all B.S."" Gutfeld made the statement on The Five as the panel discussed President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement. We interviewed several scientists who said Gutfeld’s statement -- that temperature increases are within the margin of error and therefore not increasing --  is wrong. Rather than point to ""single year"" increases, experts said that long-term trends clearly show the temperature has been rising for decades. Robert Jackson, chair of the department of Earth System Science at Stanford, said Gutfeld’s statement, scientifically speaking, ""is rubbish."" There are two main sources of data cited to look at temperature trends: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the NASA Goddard institute for Space Studies. Both show a trend of rising temperatures. Rising temperatures should be measured over many years A Fox News spokeswoman sent us articles stating that 2016 data on rising temperatures was deceptive because of ""uncertainty in the statistics"" or because news reports hid information on the margin of error. Gutfeld focused on ""single year"" increases. Such comparisons don’t tell the full story about rising temperature, because there is natural variability year over year. It is more useful to look at long-term trends such as comparing decades, said University of Miami’s Ben Kirtman. The statement by Gutfeld ""indicates a profound misunderstanding of climate science and statistics,"" Kirtman said. ""Year over year you can’t be sure that one year is a statistically separate warming from the previous year, so you have to take a little bit longer view to remove some of the natural fluctuation,"" he said. But by looking at climate data over decades, it shows a clear rise in temperatures. NASA tracks the annual temperature anomaly which means a change, up or down, from a long-term average. NASA’s latest annual data released in January 2017 shows that temperatures have been rising upward since the 1960s:    In January 2017, NASA reported that the Earth’s 2016 surface temperatures were the warmest since modern recordkeeping began in 1880, according to independent analyses by NASA and NOAA. Globally-averaged temperatures in 2016 were 1.78 degrees Fahrenheit (0.99 degrees Celsius) warmer than the mid-20th century mean -- making 2016 the third year in a row to set a new record for global average surface temperatures, NASA concluded. NASA stated that even taking into account the uncertainties in the interpretation of year-to-year temperature differences, NASA estimated 2016 was the warmest year with greater than 95 percent certainty. NASA attributed the rising temperatures driven largely by ""increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere."" Most of the warming occurred in the past 35 years, with 16 of the 17 warmest years on record occurring since 2001. According to NASA, for recent years the margin of error is about ±0.05 degrees Celsius. Uncertainties can arise in the data due to different methods in dealing with missing data and weighting the two hemispheres; however, the uncertainty is quite small, said Kevin Trenberth, a  Distinguished Senior Scientist in the Climate Analysis Section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Trenberth said that 2014 was the warmest on record at that point, but perhaps not outside uncertainty. But 2015 broke that record well outside the uncertainty, and then 2016 further broke that record, again well outside any uncertainty.  So 2014-16 are the warmest three years on record, he said. Reto A. Ruedy, an expert at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said Gutfeld’s statement ""lacks any logic."" ""It argues that anything that changes less than the margin of error within some arbitrarily selected time interval (here a year) necessarily does not change,"" he said. ""By the same logic you can argue that babies don’t grow in size, since within a day or even a week they grow less than the margin of error in determining their size."" The long-term trend which shows an overall rise in temperature since 1880, said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado. ""Gutfeld uses flawed logic to claim that there is no trend. But there is a trend,"" he said.  ""The lesson here?  Always look at the actual data."" Our ruling Gutfeld said, ""every single year that there's an increase (in temperature) it's within the margin of error -- meaning it isn't increasing."" While some years are within the margin, others definitely aren't, so Gutfeld is wrong when he says ""every single"" year is within the margin of error. Also, long-term trends over decades show that temperatures are clearly rising. So Gutfeld is wrong both on the details and and the big picture",False Pants on Fire,"June 9, 2017"
Says an Internet meme shows people rejoicing over the Paris agreement.,"It’s clear that Sarah Palin hates the Paris climate agreement. What’s unclear is why she used a photo of Florida lawmakers to make her point in a Facebook meme. ""Don’t be fooled! The Paris climate accord is a scam,"" stated the headline at the top of Palin’s Facebook post June 6, 2017. (By June 7, the Facebook meme was no longer available but PolitiFact had taken a screenshot of her post, which had been shared at least 8,000 times.) Beneath the headline is a photo of an unidentified group of mostly men cheering. The Facebook post doesn’t identify the people in the photo, but they are Florida House members at the state Capitol in Tallahassee. Beneath the photo Palin shared is text that says: ""They pretend it’s about fixing our environment ... But it’s really about stealing billions from the American people and giving it to foreign countries, governments and lobbyists!""    The Facebook meme, posted after President Donald Trump pulled out of the agreement, could leave the impression that the people in the photo are rejoicing over using the agreement to steal billions from Americans. That's not the case. PolitiFact fact-checked Palin’s photo as part of our effort to debunk fake news on Facebook. Our efforts to reach a spokesperson for Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, were unsuccessful. (Palin’s post was previously debunked by other news outlets including the Miami Herald, a partner along with the Tampa Bay Times in PolitiFact Florida, and Politico.) The photo is actually from the 2011 Florida legislative session. We interviewed four of the Republican politicians in the photo: state Rep. Scott Plakon, R-Longwood, and former House members Will Weatherford, a former speaker from Wesley Chapel; Chris Dorworth of Lake Mary, and Rachel Burgin of Riverview. We also interviewed a Democrat in the photo: Jeff Clemens, now a state senator of Lake Worth. Not all of the legislators recalled the particulars of the photo, but all of them said that their cheers had nothing to do with the Paris climate accord -- which was signed years later -- or about climate change. Plakon directed us to search the Florida House website to show the real reason behind the cheering. The website showed that the photo was taken by House photographer Mark Foley. The cutline states: ""From the left, Speaker-designate Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel, signaled that session was coming to a close as members celebrate on the House floor, May 7, 2011.""    Plakon recalled some late night (which led to early morning) back-and-forth maneuvering between the House and the Senate in the final hours of that session. ""It was a famous night,"" Plakon said. The final hours of the 2011 legislative session on Saturday, May 7, were chaotic, according to a Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times timeline. As the hours stretched on, lawmakers played songs such as ""A Hard Day's Night"" and ""Help"" by the Beatles and ""The Final Countdown"" on the public speaker. At 11:30 p.m. after the House unanimously rejected a Senate bill related to rules for the state-run Citizens Property Insurance Corp., the chamber erupted into cheers and shouts of, ""It’s us versus the Senate."" At 1 a.m., senators went home. At 2 a.m., the House passed a bill that included tax cuts and adjourned as Handel's Hallelujah chorus played on the public address system. Minutes later the senators had to return -- looking tired. One member came in wearing no shoes, another with no socks and a third in jeans and a T-shirt. The session finally ended at 3:35 a.m. We were unable to confirm by deadline with House officials exactly what time Foley’s photo was taken during the conclusion of the session. But some of the members recalled the image from the conclusion of the session. ""We were all clapping because it was finally finished,"" Burgin said. She described the situation as ""humorous"" but said it was a bad choice for Palin to use a 2011 photo of the Florida House for a post about the 2015 climate accord. ""It's kind of bad taste to label Florida legislators as being involved in that, especially in 2011,"" she said. ""Everybody and their brother has been tagging me since it published, it’s kind of funny."" Many of the legislators got a chuckle about the use of the photo in Palin’s meme. Plakon, a publisher of a website used by insurance claims professionals, quipped, ""As a publisher I object to the use of low-resolution graphics."" For the record, Burgin said she has no opinion on the climate accord. Weatherford declined to express his opinion. Plakon called the accord a ""bad deal"" and sided with Trump’s position. Dorworth, who lost an election in 2012, said he didn’t support the Paris accord. ""Most of the persons in that picture probably would not have supported the Paris climate accord either,"" he said. Clemens, the Democrat, was the only lawmaker we interviewed who told us he supports the climate accord. ""Of course I support the world coming together to solve serious problems. Who wouldn’t?"" Palin posted a viral image that purportedly shows a group of people clapping as a result of the Paris agreement, presumably about the billions they will earn. Except, it’s not that at all. The photo is of Florida lawmakers elated at the long-awaited close of the 2011 legislative session. The text and photo pairing is inaccurate",False,"June 7, 2017"
"""China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this (Paris) agreement.""","Even as President Donald Trump defiantly withdrew the United States from the Paris climate agreement, he described it in contradictory terms. ""As of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the nonbinding Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country,"" he said June 1. An agreement cannot be both nonbinding and draconian at the same time. It’s one or the other. Trump continued to blur the difference when he compared the obligations of China and the United States under the deal. ""China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants,"" Trump said. ""So we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement."" We asked the White House to tell us what part of the Paris agreement gave China permission to build coal-fired plants and what part banned them for America. We did not hear back. The international declaration is big on the word ""should"" and light on the word ""shall."" As Boston College law professor David Wirth wrote in 2016, the distinction is crucial. ""Even the most cursory review of the text of the Paris Agreement discloses a careful, purposeful alternation between the mandatory 'shall' — indicating a binding obligation governed by international law — and the hortatory 'should' — nonbinding statements of strictly political intent without legal force,"" Wirth wrote. The agreement says nations shall say publicly how much they will aim to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and they shall report their progress. It’s up to each country to come up with its own plan, called a Nationally Determined Contribution, to meet the overall goal to limit the world’s temperature to 1.5 degrees centigrade over pre-industrial levels. But then it says signatory countries ""should strive to formulate and communicate long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies."" In other words, the public plan and reporting is a must-do, but the actual doing is optional. Of importance to Trump’s comparison, the agreement treats developed and developing countries differently: ""Parties aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, recognizing that peaking will take longer for developing country parties."" Wirth told us that Trump’s words are technically inaccurate. ""Nobody is allowing China to do anything, and nobody is prohibiting China from doing anything,"" Wirth said. ""And the same is true for the United States."" The agreement never uses the word coal, much less spells out how many coal-fired plants any country can build. As for China’s blueprint for what it plans to do, it does give itself until 2030 for its greenhouse gas emissions to peak. In contrast, the U.S. blueprint says ""the United States intends to achieve an economy-wide target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28 percent below its 2005 level in 2025."" Critics of the arrangement point to China’s rising emissions as evidence of a fundamental unfairness. As Trump put it, the Chinese ""can do whatever they want for 13 years."" Again, Trump’s language gives more legal weight to the agreement than it actually has, but he also overlooks other parts of China’s plan that aim to ""control total coal consumption,"" and to increase the use of renewable energy supplies. China said it would reduce the carbon intensity of its economy by 60 to 65 percent below 2005 levels, and increase the share of non-fossil energy to around 20 percent. And to get there, it would start changing its policies today. As a practical matter, China’s carbon dioxide emissions have held steady for the past three years. China just halted the construction of 103 new coal-fired power plants, and its energy agency at the start of the year announced plans to pour more than $360 billion into renewable energy by the end of the decade. Wirth said that regarding coal-fired power plants, the Paris agreement creates diplomatic pressure for countries to move away from coal, but doesn’t mandate it. ""Either China or the United States can build as many power plants as they want as long as they are offset in other sectors,"" he said. ""It was framed that way so as to give governments maximum flexibility to meet the goals they set for themselves."" Trump said that the Paris agreement allows China ""to build hundreds of additional coal plants,"" while the United States can’t. The White House offered no legal argument to back that up, and the text of the agreement fails to support it. The Paris agreement never mentions the word coal, and in Trump’s own words, it is nonbinding. It forces neither China nor the United States to do or not do anything. China’s voluntary plan to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions does allow emissions to rise until 2030, but it also moves the country away from reliance on coal, and the tangible results have been the cancellation of over 100 new coal-fired plants. Neither the law nor realities on the ground support Trump’s statement",False,"June 5, 2017"
"""70 percent of Florida is in drought today.""","Former Vice President Al Gore said that the global community will have to continue to respond to climate change after President Donald Trump’s ""reckless"" decision to pull out of the Paris climate change agreement. Gore said that evidence abounds that climate change is real (it is ), and people ""don’t have to rely on the virtually unanimous opinion of the scientific community anymore."" ""Mother nature is telling us every night on the TV news now is like a nature hike through the book of Revelation,"" Gore said on Fox News Sunday on June 4. ""People are noticing this, these downpours and historic floods. We’ve had 11 once-in-a-thousand-year downpours in the U.S. just in the last 10 years. We’ve got these wildfires that become mega fires now. Seventy percent of Florida is in drought today. Missouri declared an emergency just a couple of days ago because of another one of these. And they keep on coming."" Gore correctly cited a drought figure for Florida from a commonly used drought index. We will explain what that index shows and what the drought means in Florida. A spokeswoman for Gore said that he was citing the United States Drought Monitor, a weekly map published on Thursdays showing drought conditions. The monitor, established in 1999, is produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The map is based on measurements of climatic, hydrologic and soil conditions as well as reported impacts and observations from more than 350 contributors around the country. The monitor showed that 71.66 percent of Florida was in a moderate to extreme drought as of May 30. (The previous few weeks it had been between 65 and 66.) While that was the highest this year, there have been multiple other weeks that it reached similarly high levels since 2000. The last time the drought monitor showed Florida’s area of drought was as high as 71 percent was February 2013. As bad as this drought is, it’s been even worse. During two weeks in April 2012, 99.96 percent of Florida was in a drought. More than 72 percent of Florida was in a drought between late January and early June 2012. There was also an extended period of drought between December 2010 and July 2011 and between April and August 2007. There were also periods of drought in 2000-01. Florida’s dry season runs from about November through May and can leave Florida prone to drought conditions. If the dry season is drier than usual and the wet season is late to appear, a period of drought can run into summer, said Victor Murphy, climate service program manager for NOAA's National Weather Service-Southern Region. There is a small bit of good news: The return of the rainy season — under way this first week of June — should improve drought conditions. ""There have been at least three other instances in the past 10 years when this has occurred,"" Murphy said. ""Not coincidentally, all of these events began in the winter/spring (dry) season, and ended during the summer. This event will be similar. ""Since the Florida wet season has returned with a vengeance over the past week, and is forecast to continue over the next few weeks, the amount of Florida in drought two to four weeks from now should be substantially less than what it is today."" Gore tied in several weather events to illustrate the effects of climate change. Experts told us that Florida is prone to periodic droughts, but rising temperatures as a result of climate change can make droughts worse. ""It’s part of the climate -- part of natural cycles,"" said David Zierden, the state climatologist for Florida who works at the Florida Climate Center at Florida State University. ""Our current drought is no worse or more prolonged than any other drought we go through periodically."" This year the Florida Peninsula only received half of its normal rainfall during the dry season, leading to the most active wildfire season since 2011. Temperatures have been rising in Florida -- the statewide average temperature for 26 of the last 27 months have all been warmer than normal, Zierden said. ""There is an increasing temperature trend, and warmer temperatures lead to greater evapotranspiration rates, which can exacerbate these periods of drought,"" Zierden said. (Gore’s spokeswoman pointed to an article by the Union of Concerned Scientists that makes a similar point.) While Gore’s numerical statement about the drought is correct, David Nolan, chair of the University of Miami’s Department of Atmospheric Sciences, cautioned against pointing to any particular weather event as proof of climate change. ""I am generally not comfortable with relating any local event, a drought in one place or a flood in another, to global warming,"" Nolan said. ""What matters most is global average temperature, because that drives sea level rise, which eventually will be the biggest problem."" Gore said ""70 percent of Florida is in drought today."" Gore correctly cited the United States Drought Monitor which showed that 71.66 percent of Florida was experiencing a drought for the week ending May 30. However, that drought percentage isn’t unheard of in Florida -- there have been other periods of drought since 2000 when the monitor began mapping drought data",Mostly True,"June 5, 2017"
"""A majority of President Trump's supporters and voters wanted (the United States) to stay in"" the Paris Agreement.","Former Vice President Al Gore said most backers of President Donald Trump wanted the United States to remain a party to the Paris accord on climate change. Trump announced on June 1 that he would set the country on a course to withdraw from the agreement, which lays out ambitious but voluntary goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to limit the global temperature. ""The president made the wrong decision in my view and in the view of most Americans,"" Gore said in a June 4 interview on ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos. ""A majority of President Trump's supporters and voters wanted us to stay in."" Gore made it sound like the president’s decision was out of step with his supporters, so we decided to take a closer look at how his voters view the global climate pact. Gore, an environmentalist who favored sticking to the deal, appears to be referring to a joint poll conducted by Yale University and George Mason University immediately after the 2016 election that looked at what American voters -- and Trump voters in particular -- thought about U.S. participation in the Paris Agreement. (It is the only poll we could find that homed in on Trump voters’ position on the Paris deal.) Overall, the poll found that nearly 70 percent of registered voters wanted the United States to stay in the international agreement that’s been signed by 194 other countries. That appears to dovetail with a separate Rasmussen poll of likely voters that found only 30 percent agreed with Trump’s decision to withdraw. The Yale-GMU poll also found that a slim majority of registered Republicans -- 51 percent -- said the United States should participate in the pact. However, this result fell within the 3 percent margin of error, so it should not be taken as an ironclad indication of majority support. As for Trump voters, the poll describes their attitudes about the environment in a light that may strike some as a surprising, given Trump’s previous dismissal of climate change as a ""hoax."" Most Trump voters who responded to the poll voiced support for some climate-friendly policies. Strikingly, nearly half backed an Obama administration policy limiting carbon emissions from coal-powered plants, as well as a carbon tax on fossil fuel companies. On Gore’s central point, the poll found that among Trump voters, 47 percent wanted to participate in the Paris Agreement, compared to 28 percent who supported opting out, with a quarter expressing no opinion. So, 47 percent support among Trump voters amounts to a plurality -- not a majority, as Gore said. This may seem nitpicky, but had Gore said that more Trump voters wanted to remain in the agreement than leave it, his description of the Yale-GMU poll would have been accurate. Since this is the only poll we found that asked Trump voters specifically about U.S. participation in the Paris Agreement, we wondered how much credence we should give the data. For insight on the Yale-GMU poll’s reliability, we turned to polling experts Karlyn Bowman of the American Enterprise Institute and Charles Franklin, who directs the Marquette Law School Poll. Both agreed Yale-GMU’s polling generally employs sound statistical methods and is considered highly reputable in the field. Bowman said there’s no sign that the poll’s funding sources, including the Energy Foundation, swayed the pollsters’ findings. Our experts also agreed that the 401 self-identified Trump voters who responded to the poll amounted to an adequate sampling, and that the poll’s roughly 5 percent margin of error was a fair estimate. But we got some interesting answers when we asked our experts to consider the Yale-GMU question that elicited the relevant data, which read: ""One year ago, the United States signed an international agreement in Paris with 196 other countries to limit the pollution that causes global warming. Do you think the U.S. should participate in this agreement, or not participate?"" Franklin said there’s no issue with question phrasing, per se. But given his belief that most people don’t know the details of the Paris Agreement, Franklin said the opinion may be ""more of a reflection of a general attitude toward and belief about climate change."" That’s important because, as Gallup points out, Americans are open to arguments about helping the environment and containing global warming, on the one hand, and arguments about the costs of imposing burdens on the U.S. economy that might slow job growth, increase federal spending or lead to unfair outcomes for the United States, on the other. However, what the Yale-GMU question did not do was challenge respondents to wrestle with these trade-offs, which is the core of any meaningful environmental policy, including the Paris Agreement. Had the question addressed this tension, the findings may have been quite different. By failing to address the costs of participation, the Yale-GMU question may very well have been interpreted to mean, ""Do you dislike pollution and like working with other countries?"" Bowman said that given how low climate change ranks on Americans’ priority list it’s unlikely that subsequent polls will show Trump voters emerging as strong environmentalists. What’s more likely, she said, is that future polling on climate change would break along partisan lines. Franklin agreed that forthcoming polls will provide important context. ""This is one poll taken shortly after the election,"" he said. ""Now that Trump has acted on this, will those numbers shift?"" Gore said, ""A majority of President Trump's supporters and voters wanted us to stay in"" the Paris Agreement. One poll taken immediately after the 2016 election found 47 percent of Trump voters supported U.S. participation in the Paris Agreement that Trump withdrew from. That amounts to a plurality, not a majority. While our experts lauded Yale-GMU's statistical methodology and reputation, the poll question skirted the tension inherent in policymaking. A more meaningful question about whether or not to participate in the Paris Agreement would force respondents to wrestle with environmental and economic trade-offs. Ultimately, it's risky hanging a factual assertion on any one single poll, and a fuller, more accurate picture of Trump supporters' opinion of environmental policy is likely to emerge through additional polling over time",Mostly False,"June 5, 2017"
"""Syria and Nicaragua are the only nations that didn't sign the Paris Agreement. Nicaragua said it wasn't tough enough.""","Just a few hours before President Donald Trump was set to announce whether he will withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement on climate change, Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz questioned the president’s reported intent to walk away from the accord. ""Syria and Nicaragua are the only nations that didn't sign the Paris Agreement. Nicaragua said it wasn't tough enough. What's Trump's excuse?"" the representative from Florida tweeted June 1. Syria and Nicaragua are the only nations that didn't sign the Paris Agreement. Nicaragua said it wasn't tough enough. What's Trump's excuse? Trump’s promise to ""cancel"" the Paris Agreement is one of more than 100 promises we are tracking on the Trump-O-Meter. News outlets reported that Trump was leaning toward exiting the global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and keep global average temperature increases below 2 degrees Celsius. Wasserman Schultz tweet left us wondering if she was right about only two nations — Syria and Nicaragua — not signing the agreement, and that the Central American nation refused to sign because the agreement ""wasn’t tough enough."" Information from the United Nations and statements by Nicaraguan representatives support her statement.   The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted in 1992 and entered into force in 1994. It consists of 197 Parties (196 States and 1 regional economic integration organization). Among them are the United States, Syria and Nicaragua. The UNFCCC’s ultimate goal is ""preventing ‘dangerous’ human interference with the climate system,"" that includes greenhouse gas concentrations, according to the UNFCCC’s website. Parties to the UNFCCC during a December 2015 session in Paris adopted the Paris Agreement, seeking ""to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change."" One of the objectives is to hold the increase in global average temperature well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. A total of 175 parties signed the agreement on April 22, 2016, according to information from the UN. The agreement remained opened for signatures from April 22, 2016, to April 21, 2017. The latest nation to sign was Uzbekistan, on April 19. Overall total signatories: 195.  The only countries in the world that did not sign: Syria and Nicaragua.  The Paris Agreement came into effect in November 2016 after 55 countries accounting for at least 55 percent of total global greenhouse gas emissions formally ratified the agreement. So far, 147 parties have ratified the agreement. Wasserman Schultz office referred us to several news reports indicating that if the United States abandons the Paris agreement, it would join Syria and Nicaragua as nonparticipants. Reuters in December 2015 reported that Nicaragua objected to the climate agreement ""saying it did not do enough to protect ‘Mother Earth,’ in a symbolic protest after the deal had been formally adopted."" The news agency noted that Paul Oquist, head of the Nicaraguan delegation at the December 2015 session, said wealthy nations should do more to reduce their emissions. Nicaragua also had said developed nations were ""not doing enough to reduce their use of carbon and are not providing sufficient funding to help the developed world adapt to the impact of climate change,"" Reuters reported. ""We’re not going to submit because voluntary responsibility is a path to failure,"" Oquist told Climate Home in 2015, a media organization covering climate news. He added: ""It’s a not a matter of being troublemakers, it’s a matter of the developing countries surviving."" In September 2016, a Spanish-language post by the United Nations also said that the Nicaraguan vice president, Moisés Omar Halleslevens Acevedo, had reiterated his nation’s concerns on global warming but did not believe the Paris Agreement would prevent the worsening of the global issue. ""Many of us concur that what was agreed in Paris is not sufficient,"" and more ambitious actions are urgent, Halleslevens Acevedo told the UN General Assembly in September 2016. Nicaraguan media have also reported that Nicaragua’s absence from the agreement is due to its concerns over the agreement, not out of lack of concern for climate change. Amid a civil war since 2011, Syria’s participation in the agreement has been difficult because members of the Syrian government are subject to European and American sanctions. Wasserman Schultz tweeted, ""Syria and Nicaragua are the only nations that didn't sign the Paris Agreement. Nicaragua said it wasn't tough enough."" A total 195 of the 197 parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change signed the Paris Agreement. That includes all the countries in the world, except Syria and Nicaragua. Nicaraguan representatives have said the Paris Agreement is ""not sufficient"" and believe rich nations should do more to reduce their emissions",True,"June 1, 2017"
"""The EPA director under Obama said the Clean Power Initiative would have no effect on man-made CO2 emissions. That's what she said. Go look it up.""","During an appearance on Bill Maher’s HBO show, former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., tried to convince the generally liberal host that Donald Trump was right to shelve Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which placed stricter standards on carbon emissions from power plants as a way of curbing pollution and climate change. ""The EPA director under Obama said the Clean Power Initiative would have no effect on man-made CO2 emissions,"" Santorum said. ""That's what she said. Go look it up."" As if Santorum’s suggestion to ""look it up"" wasn’t enough of a prompt for us to take a look, a number of readers also suggested we analyze his statement. So we did. What was the Clean Power Plan? In August 2015, the Obama administration announced that its Clean Power Plan regulations would require power plants to reduce carbon emissions, from 2005 levels, by 32 percent by 2030. Scientists say that carbon emissions are a significant contributor to global climate change. Advocates added that the Clean Power Plan would also reduce other emissions that create soot and smog. However, after opponents sued the Obama administration and found some success in the courts, the plan was never implemented. Then, on March 28, President Donald Trump, as expected, issued an executive order that set in motion the plan’s dismantling. What was Santorum referring to? The primary piece of evidence for Santorum’s statement, according to Santorum spokesman Matt Beynon, was an exchange at a House Science Committee hearing on July 9, 2015, including questioning of Obama EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas. Here’s the exchange: Smith: ""On the Clean Power Plan, former Obama Administration Assistant Secretary, Charles McConnell said it best, that it will reduce global temperature by only 1/100th of a degree Celsius. At the same time, it is going to increase the cost of electricity, that's going to hurt the lowest income Americans the most. How do you justify such an expensive burden, some -- rule that is really not going to do much good, and isn't this all pain and no gain?"" McCarthy: ""No sir. I don't agree with you. If you look at the RIA we did, the Regulatory Impact Analysis, you would see it's enormously beneficial. The value of this…"" Smith: ""Would you consider 1/100th of a degree to be enormously beneficial?"" McCarthy: ""The value of this rule is not measured in that way. It is measured in showing strong domestic action, which can actually trigger global action to address what is a…"" Smith: ""Do you disagree with my 1/100th of a degree figure? Do you disagree with my 1/100th of a degree?"" McCarthy: ""I’m not disagreeing that this action in and of itself will not make all the difference we need to address climate action. But what I'm saying is if (we) don't take action domestically, we will never get started."" Smith: ""But if you're looking at the results, the results can't justify the cost and the burden that you are imposing on the American people."" McCarthy: ""Actually this is a cost-beneficial rule…"" Did McCarthy say the rule would have ""no effect on man-made CO2 emissions""? First, we should point out that neither Smith nor McCarthy mentioned emissions per se in their exchange -- they discussed temperatures, a related but separate factor. Beyond that, though, McCarthy actually didn't say the plan would have ""no effect."" It would be more accurate to say McCarthy sidestepped the question. After McCarthy’s non-response to Smith’s question, the lawmaker didn’t follow up on that specific line of questioning. Because of McCarthy’s verbal fancy footwork, it’s a stretch for Santorum to say McCarthy acknowledged the view that the Clean Power Plan would have ""no effect"" on carbon emissions. In the meantime, Benyon provided some additional pieces of supporting evidence. However, they did not directly support Santorum’s statement. Benyon cited comments by an earlier EPA administrator under Obama, Lisa Jackson, at a hearing of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. At the hearing, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., showed Jackson a chart showing ""virtually no change"" in carbon dioxide and asked her if she agreed with it. Jackson responded, ""I believe that essential parts of the chart are that the U.S. acting alone will not impact the world's CO2 levels. But as we've all said, and as many members of this committee said, the race is on for us to enter into a clean energy future. There is technology in this country that can be used to move markets not only here, but abroad, and that means jobs for Americans that we are currently losing."" This is actually a stronger example of an Obama EPA administrator acknowledging the limitations of curbing carbon emissions. However, this hearing was held in 2009, long before the Clean Power Plan was unveiled. (In fact, in 2009, the Obama administration was pursuing legislation, not regulation, on carbon emissions.) Benyon also cited prepared testimony in 2016 by former Obama assistant energy secretary for fossil fuels Charles McConnell. ""What is also clear both scientifically and technically is that the EPA’s (Clean Power Plan) is not a plan that will significantly impact global CO2 emissions."" McConnell wrote. He cited calculations that the Clean Power Plan would reduce global temperatures by 0.01 degrees Fahrenheit and that the reduction in sea level rise would be only as wide as two human hairs. ""These are facts, and facts are stubborn things,"" he said. But again, Santorum wasn’t citing just any senior Obama administration official but specifically the head of the EPA. Does Santorum have a point anyway? Some researchers have expressed skepticism about the Clean Power Plan’s value. Benjamin Zycher of the conservative American Enterprise Institute and Patrick Michaels and Paul Knappenberger of the libertarian Cato Institute, have pointed to calculations using a model known as MAGICC, which EPA itself has used. The model suggests that the Clean Power Plan would reduce temperatures by small fractions of a degree, varying by the assumptions made. A wide range of climate scientists and policy experts we checked with offered some counterpoints. First, they said the United States needs to take its own steps to curb carbon production if the rest of the world is going to follow. ""Everyone acknowledges that the Clean Power Plan alone isn't enough to stop climate change, but that's a rather ridiculous bar to hold for a single regulation,"" said William Anderegg, a biologist at the University of Utah. ""What is clear, however, is that the Clean Power Plan is likely the single most critical piece of U.S. action to fulfill our commitments under the Paris Agreement."" Second, they argued that even a small reduction would be preferable to the upward trend line the world would likely see otherwise. ""Reducing the temperature of the atmosphere by 1/100th of a degree is in fact really significant,"" said Harold Wanless, who chairs the department of geological sciences at the University of Miami. ""We shot up several hundredths of a degree last year alone. Every hundredth of a degree cooled is a step in the right direction."" Finally, Santorum's perspective ""misses the thousands of lives per year we're already saving each year by cutting coal use,"" said Rob Jackson, a professor at the Stanford University School of Earth, Energy and Environmental Sciences. And tallying up the impact of just the Clean Power Plan ignores other carbon-reduction policies pursued by the Obama administration, including higher vehicle fuel economy standards, regulations on other greenhouse gases such as methane, and heightened energy-efficiency requirements for buildings and appliances. Reasonable people can disagree about whether the costs on utilities, their employees and local economies justify such benefits. But focusing only on the global warming impact of the Clean Power Plan, as Santorum did, ignores these other considerations. Our ruling Santorum said, ""The EPA director under Obama said the Clean Power Initiative would have no effect on man-made CO2 emissions. That's what she said. Go look it up."" Many scientists would acknowledge that the climate-change impact of U.S. action by itself would be modest. However, McCarthy didn’t actually say that, and few experts would peg the impact at zero, as Santorum did",False,"April 6, 2017"
"""...the earth moves closer to the sun every year – you know the rotation of the earth. We’re moving closer to the sun.""","Republican Pa. Sen. Scott Wagner believes that climate change is probably happening. He also says he believes some of that change is ""manmade,"" too. But Wagner, a state senator from York in the midst of a run for governor, seemed this week to cite a more celestial reason why things are getting a little warmer while he was laying out policy proposals related to natural gas drilling in Pennsylvania. In a talk with natural gas advocates in Harrisburg, Wagner said climate change is probably happening, but the government should nevertheless pare down restrictive regulations on the natural gas drilling industry. ""I haven’t been in a science class in a long time, but the earth moves closer to the sun every year -- you know the rotation of the earth,"" Wagner said, according to State Impact, an NPR affiliate. ""We’re moving closer to the sun."" He added, ""We have more people. You know, humans have warm bodies. So is heat coming off? Things are changing, but I think we are, as a society, doing the best we can."" The Pennsylvania Democratic party publicly chastised Wagner for the suggestion and the senator was slammed in comments sections for the statement. So we decided to check his claim: Is the Earth really moving closer to the sun? And has body heat contributed to global climate change? Let’s start with the, er, ""manmade"" option first: Despite Wagner’s question, there is no evidence to suggest human body heat is causing global climate change. As PolitiFact has pointed out time and time again, the overwhelming majority of experts agree that climate change is happening and humans are causing it largely through producing carbon dioxide that exacerbates the Earth’s greenhouse effect. Dave Goldberg, an associate department head for undergraduate studies and a professor in Drexel University’s Department of Physics, said the idea that human body heat is changing the temperature is ""absurd."" He said the regular energy collected from the sun is about a million times larger than the energy humans emit through body heat, so Wagner was ""off by literally a factor of a million."" Wagner did say with more confidence though that the Earth ""moves closer to the sun every year,"" but that claim -- and the way he used it -- also has little root in scientific evidence. Donald Schneider, a distinguished professor and head of Penn State’s Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, said ""on average, we aren’t changing our distance and the Earth is not spiraling into the sun continuously."" Technically, the Earth does move closer to the sun every year -- and then it moves back, in that same year. That’s because the Earth doesn’t orbit around the sun in a circular motion. Instead, Schneider explained, it maintains an elliptical orbit, so for half the year, the Earth is moving toward the sun and for the other half it’s moving away. Then the process, which Schneider said wouldn’t have an impact on climate change ""on human time scales,"" repeats every year. Schneider also noted that Wagner cited ""the rotation of the Earth"" when he said the Earth is moving closer to the sun, but he likely meant ""the revolution"" or the orbit of the Earth. The Earth rotates on its axis every 24 hours, not every year. ""The Earth moves closer to the sun every year, that can be technically true in a narrow definition,"" Schneider said. ""Half the time it is. In the context of the Earth moving closer to the sun causing the temperature to go up, I don’t think is correct."" Goldberg agreed, saying he’s ""kind of disappointed in [Wagner’s] high school science teacher."" ""This idea that something that happens on a one-year time scale has anything to do with what we’re seeing in terms of global warming is a ridiculous argument,"" Goldberg said, adding that it’s ""insulting"" Wagner would insinuate scientists hadn’t considered the impact of the Earth’s proximity to the sun. PolitiFact Pennsylvania reached out to Wagner’s office in search of evidence of his claim. His office released a statement from Wagner instead, in which he said: ""I believe that the climate is changing every day, and some of that change is certainly manmade. I think that we have a responsibility to future generations to be good stewards, and I support efforts to do that."" ""However, the real question isn't is the climate changing but what role should the government play in trying to alter it,"" he said in the statement.

Scott Wagner said during a discussion about climate change that ""the earth moves closer to the sun every year -- you know the rotation of the earth. We’re moving closer to the sun."" The Earth technically does move closer to the sun every year as part of its revolution around the sun, but it then moves back. That revolution is not related to the rotation of the Earth, and as experts point out, the Earth isn’t on average moving closer to the sun. That movement closer to the sun, scientists say, wouldn’t have an impact on climate change, and one scientist even called the claim ""ridiculous."" Also, there’s no evidence to suggest human body heat is at all related to global climate change",False,"March 31, 2017"
"Carbon dioxide is not ""a primary contributor to the global warming that we see.""","The new head of the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt says carbon dioxide is not a primary contributor to global warming. ""Do you believe that it’s been proven that CO2 is the primary control knob for climate?"" CNBC anchor Joe Kernen asked Pruitt in a March 9 interview. ""No, I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there's tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact,"" Pruitt responded. ""So no, I would not agree that it's a primary contributor to the global warming that we see."" Scientists around the globe generally conclude that human activity is the leading cause of climate change because humans have exacerbated the Earth’s greenhouse effect, mainly by producing carbon dioxide. Compare Pruitt’s statement with one on his agency’s website, for example: ""It is extremely likely that human activities have been the dominant cause of that warming,"" and then, ""Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas that is contributing to recent climate change."" Environmental activists opposed Pruitt’s nomination, in part because in his former role as attorney general of Oklahoma, Pruitt sued the EPA more than a dozen times over air and water pollution regulations. However, Pruitt has said he believes in climate change and that human activity is contributing to that change, though he is unconvinced of the extent of human-caused factors. ""The climate is changing, and human activity impacts that,"" he said in his Senate confirmation hearing. When we reached the EPA for comment, they did not provide us with information to back up Pruitt’s claim. The normal environment of the earth is that several types of gas stick in the atmosphere and trap excess heat, including carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane and nitrous oxide, making a natural ""greenhouse."" Since the Industrial Revolution in the early 1800s, humans have changed the composition of the greenhouse — leading to climate change — by releasing significant amounts of carbon dioxide into the air primarily through burning fossil fuels. ""Pruitt is incorrect. CO2 is a primary contributor to global warming. That fact is not in dispute among climate scientists,"" said Anne Slinn, executive director for research of the Center for Global Change Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This chart from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows that even though the earth has experienced fluctuations in carbon dioxide levels throughout its history, there’s more carbon dioxide now than there has been in at least 400,000 years.  The previous peak carbon dioxide concentration was about 300 parts per million, 300,000 years ago. Today, the count is more than 400 parts per million. By the end of the 1970s, before global warming was readily apparent, scientists had already formed a consensus that human-produced carbon dioxide would cause the climate to change. And by the mid-1990s, scientists understood that global warming had already occurred over the past 100 years, and carbon dioxide was a substantial cause, said Ralph Keeling, director of the Scripps CO2 Center at the University of California, San Diego. ""Administrator Pruitt’s statement means that he does not accept the overwhelming scientific consensus,"" said Stephen Pacala, co-director of Princeton University’s Carbon Mitigation Initiative, pointing to a 2013 report out of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We reached numerous climate experts, all of whom reiterated the view that Pruitt’s claim is contrary to the prevailing scientific thought. For a perspective outside the norm, we also reached out to Roger Pielke Sr., an emeritus professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University, who has argued that carbon dioxide is one of many human-caused factors contributing to long-term changes in the climate, but it’s not the dominant one. For example, the release of black carbon (soot) or land use changes might have a larger effect on the climate relative to carbon dioxide than is currently believed. In Pielke’s view, a more accurate version of Pruitt’s statement would be: ""I would not agree that CO2 is the only contributor to changes and longterm variations in climate."" Our ruling Pruitt said carbon dioxide is not ""a primary contributor to the global warming that we see."" The prevailing scientific consensus is that human production of carbon dioxide since the Industrial Revolution is a leading cause of climate change. Some scientists may quibble over how much of the change can be attributed specifically to carbon dioxide, but there is no doubt that it plays an important role",False,"March 10, 2017"
"Says Donald Trump was ""caught investing in (the) Dakota Pipeline before signing it.""","A left-leaning blog asserts that President Donald Trump was busted for approving the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline for financial gain, but the facts of the case ended up being buried. ""Breaking: Trump caught investing in Dakota Pipeline before signing it,"" read the headline on an undated post on LearnProgress.org. The blog regularly posts items lambasting Trump and his policies. Facebook flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of its efforts to weed out fake news in its users’ feeds. Most instances of the story being shared on Facebook are on Feb. 8, 2017. The website did not answer our request to confirm the date. But the implication that Trump approved the pipeline in order to profit from its construction doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. In the post, LearnProgress.org cited a Nov. 26, 2016, Associated Press report that showed Trump owned shares in two companies involved in the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, a 1,168-mile crude oil pipeline that runs from North Dakota to Illinois. Environmentalists and Native American tribes have opposed the route of the pipeline, and in December then-President Barack Obama blocked completion of the project. The AP story pointed out that Trump owned between $15,000 and $50,000 in stock for a Texas company called Energy Transfer Partners. He had between $500,000 and $1 million the year before that. He also owned between $100,000 and $250,000 in stock in energy company Phillips 66, which the AP says has a one-quarter share of the pipeline. This was considered a potential conflict of interest for the future president, but to say he was ""caught"" is out of bounds. He listed the information on May 2016 federal disclosure forms. Much has been made of Trump’s stock in the companies. The issue was reported on widely, as was the fact that he said he sold the shares of pipeline parent company Energy Transfer Partners in the summer of 2016. The White House has not confirmed whether he still owns the Phillips 66 shares, so that does remain a question mark. A Trump spokesman we contacted did not answer our questions about those shares. In any event, the headline suggests that Trump dumped a bunch of money into the pipeline and then approved its construction, ostensibly to make a big profit from it. The timeline doesn’t support that. Trump said in December 2016, before his inauguration, that he would restart pipeline construction. He didn’t have any actual power to do so until Jan. 20, 2017, well after he sold his Energy Transfer Partners stock. He did sign an executive action on Jan. 24 to get the pipeline moving again. Construction resumed on Feb. 9, and the Standing Rock Sioux tribe challenged the pipeline in court on Feb. 14. The headline’s assertion that Trump was caught in some kind of wrongdoing by investing in the pipeline before approving it is wrong and misleading. The potential conflict of interest was known and at least partially addressed before Trump became president and restarted the project",False,"February 16, 2017"
"""Food waste is the 3rd largest contributor"" of greenhouse gas emissions.","As it struggles to feed the hungry, the U.N. World Food Program often reminds the public that in the face of great need, there is also great waste. Right now, the U.N. relief agency is active in about 75 nations, including conflict zones in Syria, Iraq, Nigeria and South Sudan. In a tweet, the World Food Program connected the loss of food to global climate change. ""Food waste is the 3rd largest contributor of GHGs (greenhouse gases) to our climate,"" the organization tweeted Feb. 5, 2017. The tweet no longer exists. The program deleted it after we raised some questions, so kudos for that. Here’s why it was inaccurate. World Food Program senior spokesman Steve Taravella told us they relied on a report from the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. That article included a chart that said, ""If food wastage were a country, it would be the third largest emitting country in the world."" FAO researchers estimated that a third of all food never makes it to the kitchen table and calculated the emissions that went in to growing and transporting those wasted tons.  The problem is, agriculture is an activity, not a place. It makes sense to compare its emissions to other activities, and no sense to rank it against countries. ""It's comparing apples to oranges,"" researcher Brian Lipinski at the World Resources Institute told us. ""The number for food loss and waste is comprised of numbers from individual countries, and so the data isn't mutually exclusive. So while the comparison to countries helps to establish the scale, flat-out labeling food loss and waste as the world's third largest emitter is missing necessary context."" When we raised this issue with Taravella, he agreed. ""In our effort to illustrate the scale of the problem, it seems we inadvertently mistook the metaphor in the graphic — a mythical country — for an actual source of waste,"" Taravella said. He deleted the tweet to ""avoid giving our Twitter followers inaccurate data,"" and told us he would take this up with his colleagues to find other ways to draw attention to food waste. So how do emissions from food lost and wasted stack up against other human activities? The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated total greenhouse gas emissions to be equal to 49.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide. Out of that, agriculture, forestry and other productive uses of land account for about 25 percent. Food waste is about 9 percent, but that’s not a separate piece all by itself. Emissions tied to industry (the production of fertilizer), transportation (moving food around), buildings (to store food), energy (to refrigerate it), and agriculture all contribute a bit to the food waste total. The current research doesn’t tease out emissions due to food waste separate from other activities, so there’s no way to rank it by itself. The Food and Agriculture Organization estimated that food loss and waste accounted for about 4.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide each year. That’s a little bit less than emissions from road transportation. A research group at Potsdam University in Germany used very different methods and reached a similar conclusion on the total emissions tied to wasted food. Our ruling The World Food Program tweeted that food waste is the third largest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions. That is based on a comparison to the emissions of other countries, but food waste is an activity, not a place. The World Food Programme acknowledged that it took a point used for rhetorical effect and treated it literally. The organization deleted the tweet",False,"February 14, 2017"
"""One hundred and ninety-four countries signed the Paris Agreement to control greenhouse gases. Our own voluntary agreement to accomplish the same goal — the Under2  MOU — has 165 signatories, representing a billion people.""","California Gov. Jerry Brown offered an energetic rebuke to the Trump administration’s ""alternative facts"" and ""blatant attacks on science"" in his State of the State address. The solidly blue state voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton, prompting Brown to reflect on California’s place in a broader national context in a speech traditionally used to set a state policy agenda. Contrasting Trump’s positions, Brown promised to oppose deportations of undocumented immigrants, to protect health care and to continue to act on climate change. ""One hundred and ninety-four countries signed the Paris Agreement to control greenhouse gases. Our own voluntary agreement to accomplish the same goal — the Under2 MOU — has 165 signatories, representing a billion people,"" Brown said. ""We can do much on our own and we can join with others – other states and provinces and even countries, to stop the dangerous rise in climate pollution. And make no mistake, we are going to do exactly that."" We wanted to know more about what Brown was talking about and if it is accurate. The Under2 MOU, or Subnational Global Climate Leadership Memorandum of Understanding, is a pact spearheaded by California and the German state of Baden-Württemberg in the leadup to the Paris agreement in 2015. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called it a ""game changer."" Its 165 members represent about 1 billion people and pledge to limit carbon emissions to below 80 to 90 percent from 1990 levels with the goal of keeping global temperatures from rising 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels by 2100. That’s the same goal and framework of the Paris agreement, the major international deal between nearly 200 nations. But there are a few differences between the two deals. First, Brown’s numbers need explanation. Of the Under2 MOU’s 165 members, 155 are signatories, meaning they've declared their commitment to limit emissions and to provide action plans. The other 10 are countries that have endorsed the MOU, meaning they support the goal but don’t have to submit plans.   Second, the MOU is voluntary and nonbinding, and while the Paris deal is also voluntary, it includes binding obligations on reporting emissions and progress. Third, unlike the MOU, the Paris agreement has increasingly stringent targets for signatories. The United States, for example, pledged to cut emissions 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020, and then 26 to 28 percent percent by 2025 (equivalent to 19 to 24 percent from 1990 levels).   Despite these differences, experts we spoke with said the Under2 MOU was a strong and forceful compact. But they said the MOU was a complement to the Paris agreement rather than its equivalent in terms of potential impact. ""They’re part and parcel to each other. If you’re driving those kind of reductions, those can help you get to the national targets. They’re not distinct realms. They’re nested within each other,"" said Brendan Guy, the international policy manager at the Natural Resources Defense Council. Under the MOU, California pledged to reduce emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 and actually enacted legislation that codifies the target and sets a regulatory process in place. That’s a ""really high watermark"" that hardly any national governments have met, said Danny Cullenward, an energy economist at Carnegie Institute for Science. Experts also pointed to California’s five-year-old cap-and-trade program (which the Obama administration tried but failed to implement on a national scale), extended renewable portfolio standards and its pledge to get 1.5 million zero emissions cars on the road by 2025 as examples of strong climate change action. Just how far-reaching are these targets and policies? To state the obvious, cities and states do not account for all of a country’s emissions, so their reduction pledges will not have an equivalent impact to a national commitment. California, despite being the largest state and equivalent to the world’s sixth-largest economy, accounts for 6 to 7 percent of the United States’ emissions. The other nine U.S. states that are part of the MOU (Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington) represent another 10 percent of the country’s total emissions. Looking at it another way, if all 23,458 cities from the Energy Department's city energy profile tool enacted best energy-saving practices, it would lead to a 3 to 7 percent reduction in emissions, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  ""Will these subnational efforts be enough to prevent a dangerous increase in average global temperature? Probably not,"" said Rachel Krause, a University of Kansas professor who focuses on local policy and sustainability. ""But they still can have meaningful impact."" Cullenward pointed out that the Paris agreement’s depth is the result of two decades of negotiations, while the MOU is a relatively new compact and will likely become much more sophisticated over time. ""It’s no substitute for eventual national action. But it’s a really appropriate strategy where you have national governments that aren’t interested in taking action on climate change,"" he said. Our ruling  Brown said, ""194 countries signed the Paris Agreement to control greenhouse gases. Our own voluntary agreement to accomplish the same goal — the Under2 MOU — has 165 signatories, representing a billion people."" The Under2 MOU, spearheaded by California and the Germany state Baden-Württemberg, is a climate change agreement signed by 155 cities and states that have pledged reductions in carbon emissions and endorsed by 10 countries. While its emissions impact is not as far-reaching as the Paris agreement, experts told us it is a very similar deal that fosters international cooperation on climate change and fills a void in times of national hesitation to act",Mostly True,"January 26, 2017"
"""The White House removed its climate change web page. And the healthcare, civil rights and LGBT sections.""","Barack Obama was the first president to have a robust digital strategy. His team was active on social media, and they constantly uploaded new content and tools to the White House website. But after President Donald Trump was sworn in on Jan. 20, 2017, some critics of the new administration noticed that pages about issues of importance to Obama are no longer accessible on whitehouse.gov. ""The White House removed its climate change web page. And the health care, civil rights and LGBT sections,"" tweeted George Takei, the former Star Trek actor who now has a large online fanbase. Takei is correct that as of Jan. 23, whitehouse.gov doesn’t have any specific information about climate change, health care, civil rights or LGBT issues. But these changes are routine and reflect the differences between Obama’s and Trump’s priorities. Back in October, the Obama administration laid out how it would manage the digital transition. The National Archives and Records Administration would preserve every piece of content the Obama administration published online — everything from blog posts and Tweets to transcripts and Snapchat stories. The National Archives would also freeze and archive any content posted to whitehouse.gov, then the Obama administration would hand over the domain to the Trump administration. The archived content is now accessible at ObamaWhiteHouse.archives.gov, including pages about climate change, health care, civil rights and LGBT issues.    So if we’re going to be nit-picky, it was the Obama administration that removed whitehouse.gov’s pages about these issues, along with every other piece of content their team ever published. The Trump administration started off with a blank slate. When populating the website with their own content, they did not create pages about the four issues Takei mentioned. They did, however, create six pages about issues that defined the Trump campaign: energy, foreign policy, jobs and economic growth, military, law enforcement, and trade. The Obama team handled the whitehouse.gov transition in the same manner as the George W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations. (Their websites are archived at georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov and clinton4.nara.gov, respectively.) The National Archives treats whitehouse.gov as a presidential record and follows the relevant regulations to preserve the content for posterity, while ""the new administration is free to shape a ‘new’ White House website going forward,"" said Douglas Cox, a law professor and expert in information policy at the City University of New York. Cox added as an aside that while whitehouse.gov is well-preserved from administration to administration, the websites for federal agencies may not be. So there is a bigger concern that federal records produced by the agencies in prior administrations may get lost. When the Obama team took over whitehouse.gov, they completely replaced all of Bush’s policy pages with 24 of their own, reflecting the new administration’s agenda, said Macon Phillips, who oversaw the website changes as Obama’s director of new media during the 2008 transition. The change from Bush’s version of whitehouse.gov to Obama’s was dramatic in its own way. While Trump kept the same digital platform the Obama team used, Obama’s transition team was working with a brand new one. Here’s a screenshot of whitehouse.gov on the morning of Jan. 20, 2009, the day of Obama’s inauguration, next to a screenshot from that same evening (found using the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine):  Phillips said the fact that the Trump website doesn’t have pages about things like LGBT issues and climate change isn’t really about the new administration removing pages — it’s more that his team just hasn’t made those issues a priority. ""Whitehouse.gov should reflect the priorities and point of view of the president. It’s a tool of that office,"" said Phillips, who just ended three years as coordinator of the State Department’s International Information Programs Bureau. The Trump administration did keep one notable page from the Obama administration’s whitehouse.gov: the We the People page, where the public can sign electronic petitions. Under the Obama administration, any petition to garner 100,000 signatures in under 30 days would receive a response from the White House. A petition for Trump to release his tax returns got more than 271,000 signatures in four days. It’s unclear if the new administration will officially respond to the petition. Our ruling Takei said, ""The White House removed its climate change web page. And the healthcare, civil rights and LGBT sections."" It is literally accurate that since Trump became president, whitehouse.gov no longer has specific issue pages about health care, civil rights, LGBT issues or climate change. This reflects a difference in priorities between the Obama and Trump administrations. But it’s important to keep in mind that when the Obama administration handed the whitehouse.gov domain to Trump’s team, it was a blank slate. All of the online content published during Obama’s term was purged and archived. They’re now available on a website set up by the National Archives, as was done at the end of the Clinton and Bush administrations",Mostly True,"January 23, 2017"
"""California is growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas.""","Stoking their long-running feud, California Gov. Jerry Brown recently jabbed at former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, saying Golden State is ""growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas."" Brown made this claim in the middle of an impassioned defense of climate change science at the American Geophysical Union conference on Dec. 14, 2016, in San Francisco. ""We’ve proved in California that the economy grows. And it grows in part because of the climate rules that we’ve adopted,"" Brown said. Perry, a climate change skeptic, was recently selected U.S. energy secretary by President-elect Trump. While Texas governor, he repeatedly visited California in an attempt to lure jobs to the Lone Star State, with the promise of less regulation and lower costs. In his speech, Brown said Perry’s critiques about California’s job-killing red tape don’t hold up. ""Now remember our new secretary of energy, he was coming to California to say: ‘Come to Texas because we have all the jobs in Texas."" ""Well, Rick: I got some news for you, California is growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas, and we have more sun than you have oil!""  Gov. Jerry Brown makes his claim about California ""growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas"" at about the 13:00 minute mark in the video above.  With Brown’s reference of Perry, we took his ""faster than Texas"" claim to mean faster economic growth with a focus on jobs. We decided to zero-in on job growth rates in California and Texas, while also weighing GDP and unemployment trends in the states. We’ll leave the fun comparison of sunshine to oil for Brown and Perry to wrestle with another day. Our research We concede there’s no definition for what ""a hell of a lot faster"" growth looks like. Still, we’ll do our best to sort out the governor’s claim. Brown’s spokeswoman pointed us to several news articles detailing California’s recent economic improvements. Looking solely at 2015 job growth rates, Brown’s claim appears to hold up. In that year, California added 483,000 jobs, posting a jobs growth rate of 3 percent, based on data we crunched from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That pace was twice as fast as Texas’ 1.5 percent job growth rate. California’s rapid employment gains have slowed somewhat to about 2 percent this year through November. That may not qualify as ""a hell of a lot faster,"" but it’s still greater than Texas’ roughly 1.6 percent job growth rate so far this year. The business website Kiplinger.com forecast California would rank 10th in the nation among states for fastest job growth in 2016. It noted that Texas was not on its Top 10 list. It wasn’t long ago, however, that Texas outpaced California. In 2014, Texas recorded a 3.7 percent job growth rate, ahead of California’s 2.9 percent pace. Looking to the future, California’s job gains may slow. The closely watched UCLA Anderson Forecast predicts jobs to grow by only 1.5 percent in the state during 2017 and just 0.8 percent in 2018. Because Brown used the phrase ""is growing,"" we’ll judge him on the most recent figures, not future forecasts. Overall economy While the pace of job growth is important, it’s not the only measurement of a state’s economic health. And Brown’s claim could be interpreted as California’s overall economy, not just jobs, is growing much faster than the economy in Texas. In August, PolitiFact Texas took a deep look at the economies of both California and Texas to evaluate a June claim by Julián Castro, the U.S. secretary of Housing and Urban Development, that ""Today, California is kicking our butt, creating more jobs and more economic growth than Texas."" It rated the claim True, citing greater jobs, per capita income and GDP growth rates in California. It noted Texas had a lower jobless rate. Building on that fact check, we looked at the most recent economic figures for both states to see if the assessment still holds. We found that California’s GDP grew faster than Texas’ in the first two quarters of this year, at rates of 2 percent and most recently 2.2 percent compared with Texas’ 1.3 percent and its most recent quarter, a negative 0.8 percent, according to a news release in December by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. It was a different story in 2015 when Texas’ GDP expanded by 4.8 percent (a figure that was recently revised upward) compared with California’s 3.8 percent GDP expansion. Comparing unemployment rates, Texas, at 4.6 percent in November, has consistently fared better than California, where the rate was 5.3 percent in November, and has hovered well above 5 percent this year. California had one more economic bright spot in 2015: Per capita personal income grew at twice the rate as in Texas, 5.4 percent to 2.6 percent, according to federal data. Our ruling Gov. Jerry Brown recently claimed ""California is growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas."" We took this to mean economic growth with a focus on the pace of job creation. California’s 3 percent job growth rate in 2015, which doubled Texas’ pace, definitely fits into Brown's colorful claim. But California’s rate has slowed to about 2 percent so far this year, closer to Texas’ 1.6 job growth rate. Other economic metrics show California faring better than Texas in several, though not all, categories: California’s GDP expanded faster than Texas’ GDP in the first two quarters of this year, though Texas had a faster GDP growth rate in 2015. Also, per capita income grew twice as fast in California as Texas in 2015, also backing Brown’s statement. Texas, however, has consistently held a lower jobless rate than California in recent years.   Brown, like the state’s economy in recent years, is on the right track. Although California has expanded jobs and its economy faster than Texas in many cases, there are a few cases where that growth has been strong but not necessarily ""a hell of a lot faster",Mostly True,"December 19, 2016"
"Says climate scientist James Hansen says ""we have until perhaps 50 years from now,"" or maybe a little longer ""and at that point, we are looking at 10, 20, 30 feet of sea-level rise.""","Presidential candidate Jill Stein told a boisterous Texas crowd that a respected scientist foresees the loss of coastal cities within a half century due to creeping seas. ""In this election, we’re not just deciding what kind of a world we will have, but whether we will have a world or not going forward,"" Stein said Oct. 17, 2016 at a forum at Austin’s Huston-Tillotson University. As of mid-November 2016, with some votes left to be counted, Stein appeared to have drawn about 1 percent nationally in her second run as the presidential nominee of the Green Party, which emphasizes environmental sustainability. Its party platform describes environmentalism and justice as intertwined and calls for ""an ecological society that is harmonized with nature."" Stein said at the forum: ""Jim Hansen, the father of climate science; he hasn’t been wrong yet in about 40 years of climate science. And his latest predictions are that, folks, we have until perhaps 50 years from now — maybe a little bit longer, but maybe not. And at that point, we are looking at 10, 20, 30 feet of sea level rise which means goodbye to population centers on the coasts."" Of the nation’s 50 most populous cities, 16 lie in part at sea level, according to the US Geological Survey. The cities include New York, Miami, Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Baltimore, Portland and Seattle. Scientists have attributed sea-level rise to the melting of glaciers and ice caps, caused by the Earth’s warming atmosphere. In July 2013, PolitiFact rated True a claim by U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., that sea levels measured in Florida had risen nine inches since the 1920s, finding corroborating historical data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The agency attributes the rising seas to a combination of thermal expansion (because warm water expands) and melting ice. Then again, nine inches is a whole lot less than 10 to 30 feet. So, did a top climate scientist predict that much of a sea-level rise in about 50 years? We emailed the Stein campaign for the nominee's backup information but didn’t hear back. Otherwise, a Google search led us to think Stein was citing James Hansen, the climate scientist who testified to Congress about global warming in 1988 while he was director of NASA’s Institute for Space Studies; in that testimony, he warned of resultant heat waves and droughts to come, not of rising seas swallowing cities. We noticed too that Stein made a similar claim in an Aug. 10, 2016 Twitter post warning about Americans losing homes due to a nine-foot sea-level rise by 2050. At the time, Stein spokeswoman Meleiza Figueroa said Hansen was the candidate’s source. An Aug. 17, 2016, Washington Post news story went on to characterize the nine-foot figure as a possibility, not a prediction, also saying that the prospect ""doesn’t represent a scientific consensus."" Hansen’s hypothesis For our part, we emailed Hansen, who works for Columbia University’s Earth Institute, to run Stein’s claim by him.  He wrote back that he has forecasted ""multi-meter sea level rise"" in 50 to 150 years, which he wrote ""means loss of most coastal cities."" Hansen also pointed us to a study he co-authored with 18 fellow scientists from the U.S., China and Europe, published March 22, 2016, in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics. The 52-page study flatly predicts the 50-to-150 year timeframe for sea-level rise. Yet it ties that expectation to the authors’ hypothesis that polar ice caps will melt drastically faster than what had been estimated by that time by most scientific studies. The study repeatedly warns of potential rise by ""several meters,"" we noticed, but doesn’t have specific figures equal to the 10-to-30 foot range declared by Stein. The study also acknowledges that the data used to test the authors’ hypothesis were imperfect, making the implications uncertain. Researchers, the study says, used ""coarse-resolution modeling and simplifying assumptions"" and so ""raises fundamental questions that point towards specific modeling and measurement needs."" It also states ""the record is too short to confirm the nature of the response""--meaning there’s too little data to know for sure how quickly the ice caps will melt. We’re sharing next more detail about the basis of the hypothesis and the authors’ related conclusions. The study, drawing on computer models taking into account ancient climate data revealed by ocean sediment cores plus more recent observations of ice melt, ocean currents and global surface temperatures, specifically hypothesizes that the ice caps will melt at an exponential, as opposed to linear, rate. Under that scenario, the study posits, the volume of discharged meltwater would double every 10, 20 or 40 years. Still, the authors note, ""the record is too short to confirm"" which timeframe will prove out, though limited modern observations put it nearer to 10 years, they say.   ""If (greenhouse gas) emissions continue to grow"" (which they were as of 2011, according to federal data published in 2015), the study says, ""multi-meter sea level rise would become practically unavoidable, probably within 50-150 years.""    The study says: ""Social disruption and economic consequences of such large sea-level rise, and the attendant increases in storms and climate extremes, could be devastating. It is not difficult to imagine that conflicts arising from forced migrations and economic collapse might make the planet ungovernable, threatening the fabric of civilization."" The Hansen-led study drew wide attention at its debut with some experts saying the conclusions were speculative rather than certain. On March 22, 2016, the New York Times ran a story headlined, ""Scientists warn of perilous climate shift within decades, not centuries,"" and the Post wrote, ""We had all better hope these scientists are wrong about the planet’s future."" A main point of those news stories: the possibilities raised by Hansen and his co-authors overstepped the accepted spectrum for projected sea-level rise in existing scientific literature.   Other sea level forecasts Other prominent predictions: --The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2013 forecasted sea level rise between 0.6 and one meter by 2100. --In 2014, the U.S. National Climate Assessment, a federal project, predicted between one and four feet of sea level rise by the century’s end, about 0.3-1.2 m. --The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in its plans for incorporating sea level change into civil works construction, holds that ""a credible upper bound for 21st Century sea-level rise would not exceed 2 meters. So, Hansen and others indeed made bold predictions. But the predictions were based on a hypothesized phenomenon of exponential ice cap melt. Other researchers Next, we turned to outside experts for interpretation. We looked up Climate Central, a New Jersey-based a New Jersey-based organization of scientists studying climate change, and emailed the head of sea level research there, Benjamin Strauss, to inquire if Hansen’s researcher seemed credible. Asked about Stein’s claim that Hansen hasn’t been wrong in 40 years, Strauss said Hansen ""is definitely one of the greatest heroes of climate science, and he has often been prescient, but everyone makes mistakes."" Regarding the March 2016 study, Strauss said it ""was far outside the mainstream of climate or sea level science. It was very provocative, and coming from him it must be taken seriously, but specialists were and remain extremely skeptical of its projections and conclusions."" We wondered what could set Hansen’s conclusions so far apart from the accepted projections. Per our reading, public discussions posted online and other news analyses, it was largely based on a hypothesized snowball effect in ice cap melting. The study said that as freshwater poured off melting polar ice, it would form a cap atop the relatively heavy ocean saltwater; that would suppress vertical currents that bring polar sea water to the surface to cool, thereby warming the ocean subsurface, speeding melting at the deepest levels of the ice caps and increasing the rate of freshwater runoff. When Hansen emailed, he also pointed out the extensive public review process posted online. There, we found commentary from other researchers on the study. Peter Thorne, director of the Irish Climate Analysis and Research Units at Maynooth University in Ireland, left a 12-page review in which he addressed the proposed snowball effect of ice cap melt. The hypothesis, he wrote, ""relies to an uncomfortable extent upon a causal chain of the nature given a then b and because b then c and c means that d shall occur etc. Each link in the chain is certainly plausible based upon the relatively scant evidence at hand, but it is not by any stretch determinant."" Thorne also wrote: ""At the same time, however, it would be foolish in extremis to discount this out of hand as a possibility of what shall occur"" because ""we do not know enough about the earth system as a whole"" and ""I share many of the author’s manifestly obvious concerns"" about the dangerous implications of a warming climate. Texas state climatologist By email, we ran the densely-worded study by Texas state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon, a professor of meteorology at Texas A&M University. Nielsen-Gammon replied that the study's mention of sea level rise amounted to more of a ""statement of the possible"" as opposed to an actual sea-level-rise prediction."" He wrote that he read the study and explained that Hansen and the team hypothesized an exponential increase in meltwater discharge, then tested the hypothesis using observed meltwater rates for Greenland and Antarctica. He said the authors ""concluded that the observed record was too short to determine whether meltwater discharge is increasing exponentially, let alone what the time scale of increase is, though the data is consistent with their hypothesized rapid exponential increase."" Hansen acknowledged as much in a 15-minute video he released in conjunction with the paper on March 21, 2016. Hansen said in the video: ""The data records are too short, but if we wait until the real world reveals itself clearly, it may be too late to avoid sea-level rise of several meters and loss of all coastal cities."" If the volume of discharged meltwater doubles in ten years, he said in the video, seas could rise one meter in about 50 years; if the volume doubles in 20 years, seas could rise one meter in about 100 years. Our ruling Stein said Hansen predicted 10 to 30 feet of sea-level rise within 50 years or ""maybe a little bit longer."" Hansen published startling predictions exceeding established forecasts of sea-level rise related to climate change. But even under the most urgent scenario, the Hansen-led study projects about one meter—3.3 feet—of sea-level rise in 50 years. It projects, with some admitted uncertainty, multi-meter sea-level rise within 50 to 150 years",False,"November 23, 2016"
"Global warming leads to much quicker spread of the Zika virus because the increased temperature, ""makes mosquitoes mature faster,  . . . bite more due to having a higher metabolism, and makes the Zika virus inside of them incubate faster.""","In a nod to environmentally oriented voters, Hillary Clinton campaigned in Miami with Al Gore to detail her plans for investing in green energy and combatting global warming. During his speech, Gore highlighted the dangers that global warming poses to public health in the United States. While discussing Florida’s Zika outbreak, he claimed that increased temperatures energize Zika-carrying mosquitoes and make the disease spread faster. ""The change in climate conditions changes the places where these tropical diseases become endemic and put down roots,"" he said. ""Increased temperature from global warming makes mosquitoes mature faster, makes them bite more due to a having a higher metabolism, and makes the Zika virus inside of them incubate faster, leading to much quicker spread of the disease."" Gore’s overall message was focused on Zika transmission in the United States. But scientists across the world have expressed concerns that global warming could increase transmission of tropical diseases such as dengue fever and malaria in many countries. We decided to take a closer look at the effect of global warming on mosquitoes and the diseases they carry. Global warming and mosquitoes Research suggests that higher temperatures from global warming could increase the habitat range of Aedes aegypti, the species of mosquito that transmits Zika virus, yellow fever and dengue. For example, a recent study simulated the change in habitat for Aedes aegypti in two different global warming scenarios until the year 2080. The researchers found that even in a model with moderate greenhouse emissions, the mosquitoes would be able to expand into areas that were previously too cool to live in, such as the northeastern United States and southern Europe. They concluded that up to an additional 298 million to 460 million people could end up exposed.  Graphs showing the projected spread of the Aedes aegypti mosquito in two global warming simulations. Figure A shows the mosquito’s current distribution, where red regions have the highest level of activity and blue regions the lowest. Figure B models changes in habitat between 2061 and 2080 with moderate greenhouse emissions. Figure C is the same, but assumes a higher level of emissions. Purple shading shows regions where the mosquitoes would become more prevalent. Source: Monaghan et al. But how do rising temperatures directly affect the metabolism and life cycle of Zika-carrying mosquitoes? Andrew Monaghan, lead author of the mosquito habitat study and a researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, told us that global warming has the potential to elevate transmission risk due to changes in the mosquito’s behavior. ""Warmer temperatures increase Aedes mosquito development and survival rates, affect biting behavior, and speed up the extrinsic incubation period for Aedes-transmitted viruses such as Zika,"" he said. ""There is strong scientific consensus on these aspects, based on numerous laboratory and field studies."" This effect isn’t unique to mosquitoes with the Zika virus. According to Laura Norris at USAID, the reproduction rate of a variety of mosquito-borne viruses is directly correlated to the mosquito’s metabolism. Because all mosquitoes are cold-blooded, increased temperatures would lead to faster reproduction of the virus and would yield mosquitoes that can spread disease earlier in their life cycle. A complicated picture Scientists suspect that global warming is playing an increasingly large role in outbreaks of tropical disease. A World Health Organization report notes that dengue and malaria transmission increased in several Asian countries during unusually warm El Niño years. Other trends include the spread of ticks that carry Lyme disease and encephalitis into northern Europe and the resurgence of malaria in the East African highlands. However, experts stressed that climate change is an extremely complex phenomenon that could have different and unpredictable effects on mosquito ecology and disease transmission, depending on the region. Monaghan noted that in regions where the temperature is already near the upper threshold for mosquito habitability, global warming could actually reduce transmission risk due to decreased survival rates in extreme heat. However, these areas of lower risk would likely be small compared to areas that would end up with a higher transmission risk. Additionally, other changes in climate such as rainfall and humidity complicate the picture. Mosquito-borne disease could increase in regions that experience more rainfall due to wider availability of potential breeding pools. Other locations could see decreases in the mosquito population due to droughts. Finally, it’s important to remember that disease transmission isn’t affected by just one variable, but rather by an intricate mosaic of factors involving modern human travel, poverty, ecology, habitat modification and genetic variation. The challenge for scientists lies in sorting out the effects of global warming from these other issues. Greg Lanzaro, professor at University of California at Davis, said he wasn’t aware of any compelling evidence that linked Zika spread to global warming. He instead identified increased human travel and trade as the major drivers behind the spread of mosquitoes and pathogens to new environments. Walter J. Tabachnik, a professor at the University of Florida’s Medical Entomology Laboratory, thinks that climate change will change disease transmission, but cautioned against making any sweeping conclusions.  He directed us to several of his papers that highlighted the shortcomings of current disease models and called for more research in the field. The lesson is that although global warming could change mosquito behavior and potentially facilitate disease transmission, there’s so many different variables involved and so many separate regions to study that it’s impossible to make any clear-cut predictions. Our ruling Gore claimed that global warming makes mosquitoes mature faster, bite more, incubate the Zika virus faster, and spread the disease quicker. There is strong scientific consensus that higher temperatures do speed up the mosquito’s metabolism, resulting in the biological effects Gore described. But scientists haven’t conclusively proved that global warming leads to faster spread of mosquito-borne diseases. More research is needed to understand how a changing climate fits into an already complicated mesh of human and environmental factors",Half True,"October 28, 2016"
"Says ""11 straight years of no major hurricanes striking land"" in the United States ""bores a hole right through the whole climate change argument.""","As Hurricane Matthew threatened the east coast of Florida, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh cast a far-flung conspiracy about the deadly storm’s hype.   Limbaugh, who lives in Palm Beach County, used his radio show to decry what he sees as the politicization of storms by the left to validate climate change. At the time, Hurricane Matthew was a Category 4 storm. Limbaugh accused the Obama administration of ""playing games"" with hurricane forecasting to push climate change. Hurricane forecasts come from the National Hurricane Center. The center is controlled by the National Weather Service, which falls under the administration’s Commerce Department. Limbaugh recalled how former Vice President Al Gore, author of An Inconvenient Truth, said after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans that the world could expect more destructive hurricanes because of climate change.   ""And then what happened? We had 11 years of no hurricanes -- 11 straight years of no major hurricanes striking land in the United States, which just bores a hole right through the whole climate change argument,"" Limbaugh said on his radio show Oct. 5. ""They want people to think this way: Hurricane reported. Must be climate change."" Limbaugh has made similar and wrong arguments in the past, such as when he said the media made up polar vortexes to reinforce global warming. His latest theory about U.S. hurricane landfalls amounting to ""a hole right through"" the validity of climate change is also wrong. A history of hurricanes The last major hurricane to hit the United States was Wilma, which pummeled Florida’s west side as a Category 3 storm in 2005. Wilma was a Category 5 storm at its peak while at sea and the most intense hurricane reported anywhere until Hurricane Patricia hit Mexico in 2015. As Hurricane Matthew approached, Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, tweeted Oct. 5 it has been 4,000 days since the last major hurricane hit the United States (or approximately 10.9 years).  A ""major"" hurricane means the storm is a category 3, 4 or 5, said Dave Nolan, another professor of the Rosenstiel School. To be a Category 3 hurricane, winds at the surface must exceed about 115 mph (100 knots) somewhere in the storm. ""Major"" does not refer to size, damages or fatalities — it’s about intensity, as measured by maximum wind speed, Nolan added. Hugh Gladwin, an associate professor in the department of Global and Sociocultural Studies at Florida International University, said Limbaugh added that storm surge and amount of damage are also factors and some would argue more important than wind speed. If those factors are considered, it is possible that Hurricane Sandy, the destructive 2012 storm that disrupted the East Coast, could qualify as a major hurricane. Conflating weather with climate Limbaugh uses the stretch without hurricanes to make a case against climate change, but experts said that’s all wrong. ""This has nothing at all to do with climate change,"" Nolan said. ""Hurricanes are extreme events with a lot of variability from year to year, so they can't be used to indicate long term trends about climate."" He also said Limbaugh’s U.S.-centric take on climate change ignores weather events from around the world. An example of these events include super typhoon Haiyan, which was the most intense typhoon to ever hit the Philippines, and Hurricane Patricia, one of the strongest ever to hit Mexico. Suzana Camargo, a professor of ocean and climate physics at Columbia University’s Lamont Doherty Earth Institute, said the Atlantic only corresponds to about 13 percent of the global number of tropical cyclones (hurricanes), with about 30 percent of the tropical cyclones occurring in the western North Pacific (where they are called typhoons). Point being, the lack of hurricanes hitting the United States is a localized issue, and doesn’t speak about the global issue of climate change. ""The relationship between climate change and major hurricanes is complicated and there is not much agreement on it among meteorologists,"" Gladwin said. Some researchers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, compiled research on global warming and hurricanes in 2015 and concluded that a warming climate, by heating the oceans, will make hurricanes more intense. But explicit connections have not been determined. ""It is premature to conclude that human activities — and particularly greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming — have already had a detectable impact on Atlantic hurricane or global tropical cyclone activity,"" reads NOAA’s analysis. Nolan said that science has changed course in the last 10 years. Between 1990-2005 some papers suggested that global warming will lead to more and stronger hurricanes, and we can already see this effect over the last 40 years. Since then, academic consensus has emphasized global warming will probably make fewer hurricanes, but some of them will be stronger, and we can't see any trend at all in the historical record. Limbaugh mischaracterizes Gore as an example of a liberal who has associated more hurricanes with climate change. Gore points to research that oceans have gotten warmer and have led to more intense hurricanes, but both Nolan and Gladwin said Gore never said there would be more hurricanes. Either way, Limbaugh fails to make the case that the 11-year stretch without major hurricanes hitting the United States disproves climate change. ""It's not valid to look at the number of landfalling major hurricanes in the United States to say anything about climate change, since random changes in atmospheric steering currents, unrelated to climate change, are partially responsible for the 11-year U.S. major hurricane drought’,"" said Jeff Masters, the director of meteorology at Weather Underground. Our ruling Limbaugh said the fact that the United States went 11 straight years without major hurricanes ""just bores a hole right through the whole climate change argument."" It doesn’t. There are several major flaws in his line of reasoning. First, looking only at major hurricanes that hit the United States ignores storm activity around the world. Second, storm frequency does not strictly correlate with rising temperature. Third, many other data points prove that climate change is real. Limbaugh’s argument is inaccurate and ridiculous",False Pants on Fire,"October 7, 2016"
"Says Miami Congressman Carlos ""Curbelo supports drilling offshore"" and ""repeatedly voted against President Obama's ability to fight pollution and combat climate change.""","While Miami Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo portrays himself as an environmentalist, the Democratic Party says he is no treehugger and is aligned with Donald Trump. ""Republican Carlos Curbelo and Donald Trump's ideas about the environment are more alike than you think. Curbelo talks about protecting the environment,"" says a TV ad by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The ad then shows a clip of Curbelo talking about protecting the environment and then pivots to a clip of him on an oil rig. The narrator continues: ""Curbelo supports drilling offshore just like Trump, and Curbelo repeatedly voted against President Obama's ability to fight pollution and combat climate change."" Curbelo represents a Democratic-leaning Westchester-to-Key West district. He faces a rematch Nov. 8 with former U.S. Rep. Joe Garcia, D-Miami. (Curbelo does not support Trump but said he won’t vote for Hillary Clinton, either.) We found that Curbelo supports current drilling but opposes an expansion near Florida’s coasts. And while Curbelo has taken some votes related to pollution and climate change that Democrats criticize, he has been one of the more outspoken Republicans about combating climate change.   Trump on drilling Trump has generally spoken in favor of offshore oil drilling in recent months, although his position hasn’t always been clear. He sounded skeptical about expanding offshore drilling in an interview with the Tampa Bay Times in February. ""They've already got plenty in the Gulf,"" Trump said. ""It would be a little bit of a shame (to expand drilling closer to Florida), because there's so much fracking, and there's so much oil that we have now that we never thought possible. That's an issue I'd absolutely study and do the right thing."" But Trump has been more forceful about his support for drilling since that time. ""We’re going to revoke policies that impose unwarranted restrictions on new drilling technologies,"" he said in North Dakota in May. In September, Trump said in a fact sheet that he will ""open up vast areas of our offshore energy resources for safe production"" and will eliminate ""unnecessary restrictions"" on offshore oil and gas. ‘Curbelo supports drilling offshore’ While Curbelo defended current offshore oil drilling in 2015, he has fought against efforts to expand it closer to Florida than the current 125-mile restriction. Curbelo made a video of himself standing on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico in 2015: ""The offshore oil industry in the United States fuels about 20 percent of our economy and assets like this are an important part of an all-of-the-above energy strategy that will grow the American economy and make our country more secure,"" he said. But Curbelo has voted three times in favor of Democratic amendments to protect coasts from drilling by banning funds, research or testing. He also got the House to pass a bill to force companies that spill oil in foreign waters to clean up any damage to Florida coasts. ‘Repeatedly voted against President Obama's ability to fight pollution and combat climate change’ The Democrats point to a handful of votes that Curbelo took that were contrary to Democratic efforts to fight pollution and climate change. In all four cases, Curbelo sided with Republicans in party line votes on legislation or a resolution. But the votes are cherry-picking Curbelo’s record, which also reflects his efforts to combat climate change and pollution. • In January Curbelo took a stand along with virtually all Republicans against a controversial proposal by the federal government to define which bodies of water fall under its jurisdiction. Curbelo thought the ""Waters of the United States"" rule was too vague and it was later stayed by the courts. • In 2015, Curbelo voted in favor of a bill Republicans said would prevent the EPA from using ""secret science"" and require transparency. The EPA argued it already is transparent and uses sound science. • The only vote directly about climate change was minor. The House, along with Curbelo, barred funds for a government climate model program in 2015. Curbelo opposed it because he said it was duplicative, National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Chris Pack said. • Curbelo also voted in favor of a bill to limit environmental reviews to move projects along in 2015. Importantly, the ad omits that Curbelo has been one of the leading Republican voices in Congress to come up with solutions to combat climate change. In September 2015, Curbelo signed onto a congressional resolution acknowledging climate change’s existence and later, along with U.S. Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., formed the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus. ""It is vital for Congress to acknowledge the reality of climate change as a legitimate issue requiring feasible solutions, and we need leaders on both sides of the aisle to pursue policies that will make a difference,"" Curbelo wrote in an op-ed in the Miami Herald Oct. 24, 2015. We found other actions that Curbelo took in an effort to fight pollution. In December 2015, Curbelo was one of 10 Republicans to vote against a resolution to nullify the EPA’s rules to regulate carbon emissions from new power plants. In July 2016, Curbelo opposed a vote by a Florida commission to increase allowed levels of toxins for over two dozen known chemicals in waterways.   Our ruling The DCCC said,""Curbelo supports drilling offshore just like Trump and Curbelo repeatedly voted against President Obama's ability to fight pollution and combat climate change."" Curbelo supports current drilling, but the ad omits that he has repeatedly voted against expanding drilling off Florida’s coasts. Trump, though not always consistent, has sounded more favorable to drilling than Curbelo. Curbelo has taken votes against Democratic efforts to curb pollution and to model climate change, but that is cherry-picking his record.

Well, it turns out he did say that climate change is a ""hoax"" of Chinese origin — as we’ve found in previous fact-checks. On Nov. 6, 2012, Trump tweeted, ""The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.""  So Trump clearly did say, at least once, that climate change was a Chinese hoax. The subject of this 2012 tweet came up during a Jan. 18, 2016, episode of Fox & Friends. In that interview, Trump indicated the tweet was a joke. ""Well, I think the climate change is just a very, very expensive form of tax,"" Trump said. ""A lot of people are making a lot of money. I know much about climate change. I'd be — received environmental awards. And I often joke that this is done for the benefit of China. Obviously, I joke. But this is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change. They burn everything you could burn; they couldn't care less. They have very — you know, their standards are nothing. But they — in the meantime, they can undercut us on price. So it's very hard on our business."" (Emphasis added.) Trump may call the mention of China’s role a joke, but he certainly has a lengthy record of using the word ""hoax"" to describe climate change. (For the record, in 2014 we rated a claim that climate change is a ""hoax"" Pants on Fire.) Here are a few examples: On Dec. 30, 2015, Trump told the crowd at a rally in Hilton Head, S.C., ""Obama's talking about all of this with the global warming and … a lot of it's a hoax. It's a hoax. I mean, it's a money-making industry, okay? It's a hoax, a lot of it."" On Jan. 25, 2014, Trump tweeted, ""NBC News just called it the great freeze — coldest weather in years. Is our country still spending money on the GLOBAL WARMING HOAX?""  On Jan. 29, 2014, Trump tweeted: ""Snowing in Texas and Louisiana, record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond. Global warming is an expensive hoax!""  That same day, he tweeted, ""Give me clean, beautiful and healthy air - not the same old climate change (global warming) bullshit! I am tired of hearing this nonsense.""  Trump also called climate change a ""hoax"" on the Jan. 6, 2014, edition of Fox & Friends. In addition, he said on the Sept. 24, 2015, edition of CNN’s New Day, ""I don’t believe in climate change."" Our ruling Trump said,  ""I did not — I did not — I do not say that. I do not say that"" climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. He certainly did say it — in a tweet four years ago. While he has since described that remark as a ""joke,"" Trump has repeatedly called climate change a ""hoax"" in speeches, tweets and media appearances. And he has said as recently as Jan. 18, 2016, that action on climate change ""is done for the benefit of China.""

"Says Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine ""want to shut down shale, and shut down natural gas.""","The weekend before the first presidential debate, Donald Trump went to Roanoke, Va., to talk about energy. ""Here, in Virginia, we are going to end the war on American energy and on our miners. Hillary Clinton says she wants to put the miners out of work,"" Trump said. ""Clinton and (vice presidential candidate Tim) Kaine also want to shut down shale, and shut down natural gas. What they've done is incredible."" Shale has become a dominant source of fossil fuels in the United States, thanks to a controversial process known as fracking. It wrings natural gas out of bedrock in a process that was once not considered profitable for extracting oil or natural gas. The process is efficient enough that the country's dependence on petroleum imports has declined precipitously. We wondered if the Clinton team wants to shut down fracking and the natural gas it produces. Trump's evidence Natural gas, composed mostly of methane, is extracted from shale rock by injecting it with pressurized water, sand and chemicals. Supporters note that burning it produces far less pollution than other types of fossil fuel. Critics say the process can cause earthquakes, water contamination and the unwanted release of methane, a gas renowned for trapping heat, which makes it a big player in climate change. When we contacted the Trump campaign, spokesman Jeff Wood sent us to a transcript of the March 6, 2016, Democratic presidential debate in Flint, Mich., where Clinton and her primary opponent, Bernie Sanders, were asked about fracking. Sanders said he opposed it unconditionally. Clinton, who had come under fire by Sanders for her support of the technology, was less absolute. ""I don’t support it when any locality or any state is against it, number one,"" Clinton told the crowd. ""I don’t support it when the release of methane or contamination of water is present. I don’t support it — number three — unless we can require that anybody who fracks has to tell us exactly what chemicals they are using."" ""So by the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place,"" she continued. ""And I think that’s the best approach, because right now, there are places where fracking is going on that are not sufficiently regulated. So first, we’ve got to regulate everything that is currently underway, and we have to have a system in place that prevents further fracking unless conditions like the ones that I just mentioned are met."" When we looked at this issue previously, we found evidence that Clinton had been supportive of fracking as secretary of state. She promoted it for Latin America, China, India and the European Union. In a 2009 speech, Clinton said: ""Now, I know that in some places it's controversial. But natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel available for power generation today, and a number of countries in the Americas may have shale gas resources."" She did, however, call for ""smart regulations"" on the practice. In an April debate against Sanders in Brooklyn, N.Y., Clinton was asked about her past statements as secretary of state. Clinton characterized natural gas as a ""bridge"" between dirty fuels, such as coal, and clean renewable energy, and said she was promoting it to other countries as a way to get European countries away from Russian sources. ""So we did say natural gas is a bridge. We want to cross that bridge as quickly as possible, because in order to deal with climate change, we have got to move as rapidly as we can,"" she said. Shut down fracking? Only a minority of states have banned fracking. Vermont was the first in 2012 and New York followed in 2014. Maryland has a moratorium on the practice through next year. Some municipalities have banned it as well. As for places with the unwanted release of methane — known as ""fugitive emissions"" — a 2015 study found that would apply to roughly one in 25 facilities. On the issue of water pollution, fracking critic Robert Howarth of Cornell University has estimated that 4 percent of production wells pollute water. And a 2015 EPA study said there were 151 cases of fracking spills in 11 states between 2006 and 2012.. When it comes to disclosing the chemicals used in the process, the impact of Clinton's rules would not be large. According to the American Chemical Society, 26 of the 28 states where fracking is done already have some disclosure rules, although those rules may not provide complete disclosure because they often drilling companies to protect what are regarded as trade secrets. It seems likely that if Clinton's ideas were put in place, drillers in the remaining two states could simply disclose the ingredients of their fracking solution the way drillers in other states have. When we asked the Clinton campaign about Trump's allegation, spokesman Josh Schwerin directed us to her campaign website and this statement: ""Switching to natural gas has avoided thousands of premature deaths and more than 100,000 asthma attacks by improving air quality, while creating good paying jobs and careers and helping reduce U.S. carbon pollution to its lowest level in 20 years,"" Clinton is quoted as saying. ""With strong safeguards in place, natural gas can play an important role in our transition to a clean energy economy . . . As President, I will ensure natural gas production is safe and responsible in those communities that choose to pursue it."" The Clinton campaign said she and Kaine agree on fracking and natural gas. Our ruling Trump said that Clinton and Kaine ""want to shut down shale, and shut down natural gas."" Trump's campaign points to Clinton's statements that she wants to put restrictions on the fracking process used to extract natural gas from shale, and she wants to move the world away from petroleum sources as quickly as possible. But a review of Clinton's statements also make clear that she supports natural gas as a cleaner alternative to coal and oil. Her restrictions would not shut down fracking or natural gas production",Half True,"September 25, 2016"

Kaine agreed that that young voters are crucial, but laid out ""five litmus test issues"" that should convince them to get with her. ""Do you believe in climate science or don’t you? Millennials do, Hillary Clinton and I do, Donald Trump doesn’t. Do you believe women should be able to make their own health care decisions, or don’t you? Millennials do, Hillary Clinton and I do, Donald Trump doesn’t. Do you believe in immigration reform or don’t you? We do, millennials do, Donald Trump doesn’t. Do you believe in LGBTQ equality? We do, millennials do, Donald Trump doesn’t. And finally, do you have a plan to deal with college affordability? We have one. Millennials need one. And Donald Trump, with Trump University, has ripped off students,"" Kaine said. Does Clinton have more in common with the youth than Trump on the five issues Kaine laid out? We asked the Clinton campaign and Trump campaigns for data showing how millennials feel about the various issues. We didn't hear back from the Trump side. A Clinton spokesman sent us a report that surveyed millennials in only 11 swing states. In addition, it used questions phrased to favor Democratic talking points, such as asking about ""making the wealthy pay their fair share"" and ""implementing common sense gun safety rules."" We will not be using those results. But the campaign later sent us other polling data. In addition, we did our own search. Here's what we found. Climate science Kaine’s assertion on climate change is largely accurate. Recently, a 2014 Gallup survey found that 58 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds believe global warming's effects have already begun. About a year later, a national poll conducted in 2015 by Harvard's Institute of Politics found that 55 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds agreed with the scientific consensus that the planet is warming and emissions ""from cars and industry facilities"" are to blame. But 20 percent said that, although the planet is warming, natural changes in the environment are to blame, which is at odds with the consensus of the experts. Twenty-three percent believe global warming is a ""theory that has not yet been proven.""         Clinton has called for more pollution controls, investing more in clean energy and cutting ""wasteful"" tax subsidies for oil and gas companies. Trump's website doesn’t include a position on climate change. However, the site has reposted a PBS Newshour article that says Trump regards climate change as a hoax. And as we reported in June, during a May 26 energy policy speech Trump advocated rescinding ""all the job-destroying Obama executive actions, including the Climate Action Plan"" and said he would ""cancel the Paris Climate Agreement and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs."" Women's health care Kaine said that women should be able to make their own health care decisions. Few people would disagree that women — or men for that matter — should be able to make their own health care decisions. In a political context, Kaine’s comments indicate Clinton’s position in favor of abortion rights. A 2014 poll by the nonpartisan organization PRRI (formerly the Public Religion Research Institute) in Washington found that 55 percent of millennials thought abortion should be legal in most or all cases. The same level of support is seen in people under 68. Only older Americans showed less support for abortion, with 43 percent of people over 67 saying it should be legal. Similarly, when Gallup surveyed abortion attitudes in 2015, it found that 53 percent of people age 18 to 34 identified themselves as ""pro choice,"" versus 52 percent of 35- to 55-year-olds and 47 percent of people over 55. Once again, that puts millennials in the Democratic camp, but not by an overwhelming amount. Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin subsequently directed us to a Fox News survey taken last week that found 61 percent of registered voters under age 35 reported being pro-choice. Clinton, as with most Democrats, supports the right of a woman to seek an abortion. Trump doesn't address abortion on his website, but he’s said in interviews that he opposes abortion in most cases. In a March interview, he said women who have an abortion after it’s outlawed should received ""some form of punishment,"" but he backtracked on the idea after widespread criticism. Once again, the Clinton-Kaine team seems to be in synch with at least a bare majority of millennials. Immigration Immigration is another issue where the stances of Trump and Clinton diverge dramatically. Trump has made the removal of illegal immigrants his signature issue. He wants to build a wall across the southern border and change the law that dictates that if you are born in the United States you automatically become as U.S. citizen. Clinton, in contrast, has called for legislation to allow some of those living in the United States illegally to remain, especially young adults brought to the United States as children. Most — criminals are a major exception — would be eligible for an eventual path to citizenship. On the issue of the wall, millennials are firmly against Trump. According to a 2016 PRRI survey, 70 percent oppose it, compared to 52 percent of people age 65 and older. Only 11 percent of Americans age 18 to 29 support identifying and deporting illegal immigrants (it's 23 percent for people age 65 and older), according to a 2015 PRRI poll; and 69 percent of younger voters support a path to citizenship, as do 58 percent of seniors. More recently, a Fox News poll taken in last August found that 87 percent of respondents under 35 favored setting up a system for illegal immigrants to become legal. Only 11 percent supported deporting as many as possible. Also, Trump seems to be out of step with the younger people in his own party, 63 percent of whom support a path to citizenship and only 20 percent want mass deportation. LGBT equality Polls show millennials overwhelmingly support gay rights, which is a plank of Clinton's platform. But Kaine is exaggerating when he suggests Trump is totally against LGBT equality — the Republican nominee has given mixed messages on the issue. An August GenForward survey, conducted by the Black Youth Project at the University of Chicago and the AP-NORC Center, found that young voters (defined as age 18 to 30) strongly supported LGBT individual rights including equal employment rights (90 percent), HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment (92 percent) and LGBT adoption (80 percent). According to a May 2016 Pew report, 71 percent of Americans born after 1981 favor same-sex marriage (as do 55 percent of all Americans). Clinton’s LGBT promises mirror the attitudes of millennials in the GenForward survey. She calls the Supreme Court ruling that legalized gay marriage in 2015 as a ""landmark victory"" for the country. Kaine, for his part, signed an executive order that banned discrimination based on sexual orientation in Virginia in 2006, his first year as governor. Equality Virginia, the commonwealth's LGBT organization, called him a friend and major ally in an editorial to the Advocate.  Trump, meanwhile, has vowed that he ""will do everything in my power to protect LGBT citizens"" in his speech at the Republican National Convention. He often criticizes the Clinton Foundation for taking donations from governments that oppress gay men and women. But Trump opposes gay marriage and has said in interviews during the Republican primary that he would appoint judges that would reverse the Supreme Court ruling or allow states to decide. The Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights groups that endorsed Clinton, points out that Trump’s running mate is Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, who passed a 2015 law that allowed businesses to refuse to serve gay and lesbian customers based on religious freedom; the law was modified after an uproar. College affordability Trump isn’t against making colleges more affordable, but polls show millennial attitudes on higher education costs are more closely aligned with Clinton’s than Trump’s. Many millennials say college affordability is a top issue, according to a USA Today/Rock the Vote survey, and the vast majority say higher education should be debt free (77 percent in a poll commissioned by Bankrate Inc., a financial services company). Under Clinton’s college affordability plan — retooled with input from Sanders in June 2016 and seen as a grab for his millennial voters — families with incomes less than $85,000 will pay no tuition at in-state public colleges and universities, with the income cap increasing to $125,000 by 2021. Clinton’s plan also addresses student debt refinancing. Kaine focused on complaints lodged against Trump University in his Meet the Press interview. We found that Trump University received a D-minus rating from the Better Business Bureau in 2010, the last time the consumer watchdogs gave any rating at all. Trump has been vague about his own college affordability plans. In an Iowa town hall in November 2015, he suggested he would create ""some governmental program"" to help lower-income families pay for school. He promised to ""work with all of our students who are drowning in debt"" during the Republican National Convention. His website does not list college affordability as an issue, but Trump’s policy advisor Sam Clovis floated a few ideas in a May interview with Inside Higher Ed. Clovis said the campaign thinks student loans should be ""market driven,"" and said colleges should ""have skin in the game"" and share the risks associated with student loans. Clovis rejected proposals for free higher public education. Our ruling Kaine said Hillary Clinton and millennials believe in climate change, abortion rights, immigration reform, gay rights and college affordability but ""Donald Trump doesn't."" Reputable polls back Kaine’s claim, though the VP nominee is overstating the extent of Trump’s opposition to gay rights and college affordability. Millennials agree decisively with Clinton’s position on immigration, gay rights and college affordability, and by narrow margins on climate change and abortion rights",Mostly True,"September 18, 2016"
"North Carolina’s coast ""is possibly the best place in (the) U.S. for an offshore windfarm.""","Some lawmakers want to ban wind turbines from much of North Carolina’s soil, citing concerns about interference with the flight paths of military and civilian aircraft. The N.C. Senate approved regulations in June to do just that. The House of Representatives didn’t vote on the regulations. But regardless of whether they are revived and become law in future legislative sessions, some Democrats are already touting opportunities for wind power that aren’t on land. ""NC's coast is possibly the best place in U.S. for an offshore windfarm,"" Rep. Duane Hall of Raleigh tweeted in August, responding to news of an offshore wind farm being built in Rhode Island. ""We need to do this!"" Beachgoers tend to hate the winds that stir up sand and send umbrellas tumbling away. But we wondered whether the energy industry views windy days at the North Carolina coast differently, or whether Hall’s claim was nothing but hot air. Energy potential First, we need to ask whether Hall’s claim is even relevant. It wouldn’t matter how good North Carolina’s potential for offshore wind power is compared with the rest of the country if no one is seriously interested in offshore wind power. Even though it’s a new industry in the U.S., it makes sense for wind power advocates to focus offshore. Winds tend to be stronger and more uniform over water than over land. Several offshore wind farms are in various stages of development, and the federal government wants 20 percent of the country’s power to come from wind by 2030. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, ""offshore wind is a crucial renewable resource to be incorporated in the country's clean energy mix"" because 80 percent of energy use is in coastal states. The federal Bureau of Ocean Energy management has identified three developable sites off the North Carolina coast that contain up to 3,740 megawatts of wind energy potential. That’s nearly twice as much as the solar energy North Carolina produced in 2015, when it ranked third in the nation in solar output. So the potential is there. But is it the best? The best states for wind Hall didn’t respond to our questions asking for evidence backing up his claim. So we looked up various maps and charts on our own, trying to find ""possibly the best place"" for offshore wind energy. A 2010 study by the federal government’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory measured offshore wind power potential in each state. North Carolina ranked fifth behind Hawaii, California, Michigan and Louisiana. Here's a map from the lab:  The study measured total wind power and did not factor how much space would be realistically unusable due to developmental or environmental issues. But taking reality into consideration, Cristina Archer, a University of Delaware professor who studies renewable energy, said North Carolina is ""a pretty awesome state for offshore wind."" While it doesn’t have the most total wind or the highest wind speeds, she said, North Carolina might have the best actual potential due to the geography of the coast. ""I would agree that it is possibly the best in the country, because of the ideal combination of high winds, relatively shallow waters, and a long coastline,"" Archer said. ""Other states, like California, might have higher winds, but the waters are too deep. Or Massachusetts is windier and shallow too, but it does not have the long coastline."" The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management agrees: ""Wind speeds off the Atlantic Coast and in the Gulf of Mexico are lower than wind speeds off the Pacific Coast. However, the presence of shallower waters in the Atlantic makes development more attractive and economical for now."" Factors against North Carolina There are a few reasons why North Carolina might be passed over, however. While North Carolina has more total offshore wind potential than any other East Coast state, some spots in New England have stronger winds. Hurricanes could also scare off some companies. Turbines can only handle winds up to certain strengths, and very fast winds can damage or destroy them. A 2012 study of the risk of hurricane damage in four counties with appealing offshore wind prospects – one each in North Carolina, Texas, New Jersey and Massachusetts – found that the second-riskiest was Dare County, in northeastern North Carolina. The silver lining is that most of the risk in Dare County would be from category 4 and 5 hurricanes. No storm that strong has hit Dare County since at least 1851, when hurricane tracking began. North Carolina as a whole has experienced only one storm that strong – Hurricane Hazel, with category 4 winds, hit southern North Carolina in 1954. Ocean auctions None of the pros or cons matter, however, if companies can’t access the swaths of ocean where they want to build wind farms. The only way to get that access is to lease it from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management at auction. The BOEM has identified three areas in North Carolina for auction – one in Dare County, near Kitty Hawk, and two near Wilmington. The only other such sites in the U.S. are in New York, South Carolina, Hawaii and Oregon. A BOEM spokeswoman said the two Wilmington areas won’t be put up for auction for some time, since they’re being combined with the South Carolina areas. The Kitty Hawk site could be auctioned next year. Our ruling Hall said North Carolina’s coast is ""possibly the best place"" in the country for offshore wind. We appreciate Hall’s use of the word ""possibly."" He’s right to acknowledge some uncertainty. North Carolina has neither the country’s best individual spots for wind power nor the most total potential. But it’s near the top and further benefits from a uniquely long, shallow and uniformly windy coastline that gives it competitive advantages",Mostly True,"September 9, 2016"
"""The climate hasn't warmed in quite a few years. That is proven scientifically.""","On a Wisconsin radio talk show on Aug. 1, 2016, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson was asked about global warming. ""Listen, man can affect the environment; no doubt about it,"" Johnson replied. ""We all want a clean environment. It's a goal we all share. I understand that."" Then the Republican incumbent, who faces Democrat Russ Feingold in the November 2016 election, made a statement we want to check, saying: ""First of all, the climate hasn't warmed in quite a few years. That is proven scientifically."" Johnson’s comments on WRJN-AM in Racine prompted stories in the national media, including Talking Points Memo, Slate and the Huffington Post, each of which referred to 2015 being the hottest year on record. The rate of global warming has slowed in recent years, particularly since 1998, but Johnson’s declaration is, well, overheated. Johnson’s evidence To back Johnson’s statement, his campaign pointed us to a global ""temperature anomaly"" chart from NASA. A temperature anomaly means a change, up or down, from a long-term average.  Source: NASA 
Johnson’s campaign argued that the chart shows the anomalies rose sharply from the 1950s to the 1990s, then leveled off. The trend on the chart, however, is steadily upward since the 1960s. And there was a ""positive anomaly"" in each of the past four years. Past fact checks Previous fact checks have found global temperatures hitting record highs in recent years. In 2013, when President Barack Obama said that ""the 12 hottest years on record have come in the last 15 years,"" PolitiFact National’s rating was True. And in 2014 and 2015, our colleagues rated Mostly False two claims that there had been no global warming in the past 17 years. Global surface temperatures remained relatively flat during that period, since the last powerful El Niño, in 1998. But the first decade of the 21st century -- even as it’s been relatively stable -- has been the warmest on record. NASA/NOAA In January 2016, NASA reported that separate, independent analyses by its own scientists and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found that Earth’s 2015 surface temperatures were the warmest since modern record keeping began in 1880. The globally-averaged temperatures in 2015 ""shattered the previous mark set in 2014,"" NASA said.

The 2015 temperatures, NASA added, ""continue a long-term warming trend"" -- most of the warming has occurred in the past 35 years, with 15 of the 16 warmest years on record occurring since 2001 (as is shown in the chart below).  Source: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration So, the warmest year on record was 2015, followed by 2014. Moreover, Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist National Center for Atmospheric Research, told us that temperatures in the first six months of 2016 are even higher. Our rating Johnson said: ""The climate hasn't warmed in quite a few years. That is proven scientifically."" He argues that temperatures rose sharply from the 1950s to the 1990s, then leveled off, but it’s wrong to say there hasn’t been warming in many years. In fact, 15 of the 16 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001, with the two highest years being 2014 and 2015",False,"August 12, 2016"
"Says Hillary Clinton ""negotiated the first agreement — ever — where China and India officially committed to reduce their emissions.""","In detailing their much-scrutinized marriage and love story at the Democratic National Convention, former President Bill Clinton also took care to list his wife’s numerous legislative and foreign policy achievements. Among them: ""She put climate change at the center of our foreign policy. She negotiated the first agreement ever — ever — where China and India officially committed to reduce their emissions."" While Bill Clinton’s claim is largely accurate, he’s offering a rosy spin on the Copenhagen Accord of 2009, which was at the time and continues to be widely panned. Hillary Clinton did play a key -- but not solo -- role in the talks with China and India, and it was the first time the two countries made emissions reduction pledges in an international agreement. But unlike the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 or Paris Agreement of 2015, the accord wasn’t actually an official agreement. It wasn’t ""adopted"" by signatories, but merely ""taken note of"" (in other words, they formally recognized the accord’s existence). Furthermore, the ""agreement"" was non-binding and the countries set their own voluntary targets, leading some environmentalists and experts to cast it aside as essentially meaningless. Let’s dive in. Before Copenhagen, China and India had both signed and ratified the Kyoto Protocol, which the United States backed out of. But because they were developing countries, they were not required to curb their carbon emissions. In 2007, in response to overtaking the United States as the world’s biggest carbon emitter, China released its first national climate change program and said it would reduce its energy consumption by 20 percent by 2010 and ""consequently reduce CO2 emissions."" Similarly, India released a national action plan on climate change in 2008, in which it didn’t commit to reducing emissions but laid out steps that would. But it wasn’t until Copenhagen that the two countries finally committed to reducing carbon emissions. In this sense, the accord ""played a major role in breaking"" the ""firewall"" between developed countries and developing countries when it came to climate action responsibility, according to  David Ciplet, an environmental studies professor at the University of Colorado Boulder who wrote Power in a Warming World: The New Global Politics of Climate Change and the Remaking of Environmental Inequality. ""However, whether the Copenhagen Accord was a positive development overall is definitely controversial,"" Ciplet told PolitiFact. Nonetheless, like her husband, Hillary Clinton often touts the accord as one of her major climate change accomplishments, referring to it as a ""key diplomatic breakthrough"" on her campaign website and recounting how she and Obama were ""hunting down the Chinese"" to get them to the table. She devotes a significant chunk of a chapter in her 2014 memoir, Hard Choices, to the talks. She notes the role of Todd Stern, a key negotiator, as well as her and Obama’s famous tag-team chase to find the Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiaobao during the talks. ""In a makeshift conference room whose glass walls had been covered by drapes for privacy against prying eyes, we found Wen wedged around a long table with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and South African President Jacob Zuma. Jaws dropped when they saw us. 'Are you ready?' said President Obama, flashing a big grin,"" Clinton writes. ""Now the real negotiations could begin. It was a moment that was at least a year in the making."" But according to news reports, world leaders, environmental activists and experts, the ""real negotiations"" didn’t actually lead to anything with teeth. China and India did end up agreeing to reduce their emissions and set their own targets, but emphasized the pledge was not legally binding. This basically changed the international approach to climate action from Kyoto Protocol, which had a compliance mechanism, to ""a voluntary approach where countries are free to determine unilaterally what forms of action they would like to commit to,"" said Ciplet. ""Many, including myself, saw this as a much weaker mitigation framework than a robust second commitment period to the Kyoto Protocol,"" he said, adding that even after the Paris Agreement, ""we are still not on track"" in mitigating climate change.   Our ruling Bill Clinton said Hillary Clinton ""negotiated the first agreement — ever — where China and India officially committed to reduce their emissions."" Clinton was at the table at the Copenhagen Accord, though she wasn’t the only U.S. official present. And while it was the first time China and India made pledges in an international agreement, their pledges were not legally binding. Many, if not most, environmentalists and experts say the agreement was a wash at best and a failure at worst",Half True,"July 28, 2016"
"""The president has said the national security threat facing America, the top one, is global warming.""","Paul Babeu, the Republican Sheriff of Pinal County, Ariz., near the U.S.-Mexico border, has repeatedly criticized President Barack Obama’s administration for its lack of border security. Babeu, who’s running for Congress this November against a Republican field that includes David Gowan, Ken Bennett and Wendy Rogers, warned of Mexican drug cartels in his county ahead of Memorial Day weekend on Fox News’ Hannity on May 26. But he also used the interview to make a political jab, questioning Obama’s priorities. ""The president has said the national security threat facing America, the top one, is global warming,"" Babeu said. ""It’s not an unsecured border, it’s not the terrorists we should be fighting and defeating."" This is not the first time we have heard a statement like this: In June 2015, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker claimed Obama said global warming is the ""No. 1 threat to the military and world today."" The president has said global warming is a serious threat, but it is not No. 1. We rated it Mostly False. We wondered whether Babeu’s claim holds any weight a year later. Contrary to Babeu’s claim, the president’s top national security threat appears to be terrorism. Out of context In March, after the terrorist attacks in Brussels, Obama said, ""I’ve got a lot of things of my plate, but my top priority is to defeat ISIL."" When we asked for evidence on climate change being the top priority, Tim Gaffney, a spokesman with the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office, noted that Obama has made this claim during speaking engagements. Obama has said global warming is a serious threat and has linked it to national security. But, looking back at news reports over the last year, Obama has never explicitly said it was the top national security threat. Rather, he has said global warming is a threat to the whole world. In an April 2015 weekly address, he said ""there’s no greater threat to our planet than climate change.""   In May 2015, Obama also said during a U.S. Coast Guard Academy commencement address that climate change ""is one of those most severe threats."" ""So I’m here today to say that climate change constitutes a serious threat to global security, an immediate risk to our national security,"" Obama said. ""And make no mistake, it will impact how our military defends our country."" We should also point out that the U.S. military has focused on the potential threat of climate change going back to President George W. Bush’s administration. In a December 2015 interview, Obama defended his remarks on climate change, noting at the same time that while terrorists will be ""defeated,"" climate change is the ""kind of crisis that we can’t deal with through the deployment of Marines."" Our ruling Babeu said, ""The president has said the national security threat facing America, the top one, is global warming."" Obama continues to cite climate change as a great threat to the world, but framing the issue as the country’s top national security threat is an exaggeration. Obama has said fighting terrorism is his most urgent priority",Mostly False,"June 3, 2016"
"Says ""Donald Trump says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese.""","During her take-no-prisoners foreign policy speech on June 2, Hillary Clinton reminded listeners of controversial things that Republican presidential rival Donald Trump has said over the years. At one point, Clinton said, ""Donald Trump says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese."" Did he? Yes, though he later said it was a joke. The original source of this claim was a tweet Trump sent on Nov. 6, 2012, as we noted in a January 2016 fact-check of a similar claim by Clinton’s Democratic opponent, Bernie Sanders. Trump’s tweet said, ""The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.""  So Clinton certainly has evidence to support her claim. But we should also note that Trump backed off his claim after Sanders noted them in January on NBC’s Meet the Press, calling the Chinese link a ""joke."" On Jan. 18, after Sanders had attacked Trump’s climate change views in the Democratic debate, Trump told Fox & Friends, ""Well, I think the climate change is just a very, very expensive form of tax. A lot of people are making a lot of money. I know much about climate change. I'd be — received environmental awards. And I often joke that this is done for the benefit of China. Obviously, I joke. But this is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change. They burn everything you could burn; they couldn't care less. They have very — you know, their standards are nothing. But they — in the meantime, they can undercut us on price. So it's very hard on our business."" Trump may call the mention of China’s role a joke, but he certainly has a lengthy record of using the word ""hoax"" to describe climate change. (For the record, in 2014 we rated the claim that climate change is a ""hoax"" Pants on Fire.) On Dec. 30, 2015, Trump told the crowd at a rally in Hilton Head, S.C., ""Obama's talking about all of this with the global warming and … a lot of it's a hoax. It's a hoax. I mean, it's a money-making industry, okay? It's a hoax, a lot of it."" That’s three times using ""hoax"" in one sentence. Trump has also used the word on Twitter since his 2012 tweet. On Jan. 25, 2014, Trump tweeted, ""NBC News just called it the great freeze — coldest weather in years. Is our country still spending money on the GLOBAL WARMING HOAX?""  On Jan. 29, 2014, Trump tweeted: ""Snowing in Texas and Louisiana, record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond. Global warming is an expensive hoax!""  That same day, he tweeted, ""Give me clean, beautiful and healthy air - not the same old climate change (global warming) bullshit! I am tired of hearing this nonsense.""  Trump also called climate change a ""hoax"" on the Jan. 6, 2014, edition of Fox & Friends. In addition, he said on the Sept. 24, 2015, edition of CNN’s New Day, ""I don’t believe in climate change."" And on Jan. 18, 2016, Trump said that climate change ""is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change."" We didn’t find Trump using the word ""hoax"" in the months since our previous fact-check, but he hasn’t backed off his aggressive skepticism of climate change and policies designed to alleviate it. In fact, he’s enshrined opposition to climate change efforts as a key part of his platform. In a high-profile speech on energy policy in North Dakota on May 26, 2016, Trump attacked ""draconian climate rules."" He advocated rescinding ""all the job-destroying Obama executive actions, including the Climate Action Plan"" and said he would ""cancel the Paris Climate Agreement and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs."" ""President Obama entered the United States into the Paris Climate Accords unilaterally and without the permission of Congress,"" Trump said. ""This agreement gives foreign bureaucrats control over how much energy we use right here in America."" Our ruling Clinton said, ""Donald Trump says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese."" Trump did tweet that view in 2012, though he made efforts earlier this year to describe that remark as a ""joke."" However, Trump has repeatedly called climate change a ""hoax"" in speeches, tweets and media appearances, and while he hasn’t necessarily repeated the charge that China ""invented"" climate change, he has said as recently as Jan. 18, 2016, that action on climate change ""is done for the benefit of China",Mostly True,"June 3, 2016"
"""I believe we should have tax on carbon and deal aggressively with climate change. That is not (Hillary Clinton's) position.""","Bernie Sanders still doesn’t want to talk about Hillary Clinton’s damn emails. Asked for his reaction to the State Department report of Clinton’s use of a private email server, Sanders told Meet the Press’ Chuck Todd that he’d rather talk policy differences. ""Our campaign is about defeating Secretary Clinton on the real issues,"" he responded. ""I want to break up the Wall Street banks. She doesn’t. I want to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. She wants $12 an hour. I voted against the war in Iraq. She voted for the war in Iraq. I believe we should ban fracking. She does not. I believe we should have tax on carbon and deal aggressively with climate change. That is not her position. Those are some of the issues that I am campaigning on."" Sanders is right about Clinton’s Iraq war vote and where she stands on breaking up banks, a $15 minimum wage and fracking. (For more of their policy differences, read this.) But is he also right about their differences on carbon tax and climate change? There’s no doubt that Sanders’ rhetoric on climate change and his plan to deal with it are aggressive and, unlike Clinton, he has advocated for a carbon tax. Clinton does, however, have a climate change plan. While some environmentalists have said it isn’t tough enough, others have given it positive reviews. Both the Sanders and Clinton campaigns referred us to each candidate’s climate change plan. Sanders’ plan is long and comprehensive. Beyond a tax on carbon, it includes an array of proposals from banning certain drilling and mining practices to improving the national public transit system.   Clinton’s plan is shorter and, though it doesn’t include a tax on carbon, contains similar provisions on renewables. Here’s an overview: Sanders’ plan Clinton’s plan Fossil fuel influence • Cut tax subsidies for oil and gas companies • Prohibit fossil fuel lobbyists from working in the White House • Investigate climate change deniers • Cut tax subsidies for oil and gas companies Environmental standards • Enact a tax on carbon • Ban fossil fuel leasing on public lands and promote conservation and habitat preservation • Ban Arctic oil drilling, offshore drilling, fracking, mountaintop removal coal mining and pipeline projects • Stop exports of natural gas and crude oil • Defend and close loopholes in the Clean Air Act • Increase fuel efficiency standards • Begin a moratorium on nuclear power • Create a national environmental and climate justice plan • Reform fossil fuel leasing and expand clean energy production on public lands • Defend and extend environmental standards like the Clean Power Plan • Eliminate lead poisoning, clean up brownfield sites, and create an Environmental Justice Task Force Renewables • Invest in clean energy infrastructure and modernize the energy grid • Invest in clean energy, alternative fuels and energy efficiency programs • Invest in clean energy infrastructure • Launch a $60 billion local-state-federal clean energy partnership As in her plan, Clinton prefers to focus on renewables on the stump. In a January Medium post responding to the Sanders camp, Clinton’s campaign manager highlighted her pledge to ""make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century"" in her launch speech. Clinton, who played a role in negotiating the Paris climate change agreement, herself touted her goals for more solar panel and clean electricity as ""big"" and ""bold."" Clinton has gotten her best reviews from the League of Conservation Voters, who endorsed Clinton last fall (to some controversy). The green group considers Clinton’s plan strong and aggressive and, more importantly, achievable, Tiernan Sittenfeld, its senior vice president of government affairs, told PolitiFact. ""Hillary is focused on practical solutions,"" Sittenfeld said, pointing out that there are many lawmakers in Congress who still deny climate change science. ""So (a carbon tax) is pretty remote possibility."" But some are skeptical of Clinton’s ""boldness."" Pulitzer Prize-winning website InsideClimate News called Clinton’s plan ambitious but said it ""falls short of bold."" The Washington Post’s editorial board said her ideas are ""second best."" Environmental news magazine Grist summed up her positions as not bad but ""not quite the climate hawkishness we need.""   Our ruling Sanders said, ""I believe we should have tax on carbon and deal aggressively with climate change. That is not her position."" Unlike Sanders, Clinton doesn’t advocate for a carbon tax. And while Clinton doesn’t go as far as Sanders in her climate change plan, she does have one. The League of Conservation Voters supports her plan as realistic and achievable",Mostly True,"May 29, 2016"
"""The market is making this decision. The market has driven down the cost of coal, so you have companies going bankrupt.""","Some coal country voters see Hillary Clinton as a threat, someone who would install regulations that would hurt rather than help the struggling coal industry. But Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that she thinks it's necessary to move away from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy, and she wants to do what she can to help current coal mine workers make that transition. ""But the market is making this decision,"" she said May 4. ""The market has driven down the cost of coal, so you have companies going bankrupt. So what I'm offering is a $30 billion plan to really revitalize coal country, to provide support for coal miners and their families, and I think that is the least the country owes these brave people."" Coal has historically been the country’s primary electricity generator. But several major coal companies have gone bankrupt in recent years, including Arch Coal, Alpha Natural Resources and Peabody Energy. We decided to dig into the question of how much of that change is due solely to market forces, rather than environmental regulation. We talked to coal industry experts who told us that the primary forces working against coal are market-based, notably the growth of natural gas as a cleaner, cheaper alternative. But now that coal is vulnerable, environmental regulations may seal coal’s demise. ""Coal has always been able to absorb new regulations,"" said Robert Godby, a professor and expert in energy economics at the University of Wyoming. ""But the impact natural gas has had since the fracking boom has been amazing to watch."" He added: ""This would all still be happening regardless of regulations."" Natural gas is eating coal’s lunch, and the coal companies made a bad bet on Chinese demand. Coal used to generate about 50 percent of electricity in the United States, but now it’s down to about 30 percent. Just in the past couple years, natural gas has begun to displace coal. (In this Energy Information Administration chart, the grey line represents coal, and the orange line represents natural gas.)  A recent boom in hydraulic fracturing (fracking) in the United States has dramatically increased the availability of natural gas. Natural gas prices are low, and it produces about half as much carbon. Consequently, demand for natural gas is going up, and demand for coal is going down, and fast. While natural gas is the main threat, a growing demand and diminishing costs for renewable energy, like wind and solar power, also takes away from coal demand, said West Virginia University law professor Patrick McGinley. He added that on top of all this, it’s getting harder to produce cheap coal in the Appalachia region because a century of mining has depleted supply, and so the costs of mining new coal are going up. This is all a huge problem for coal, because electricity is about 90 percent of the coal market, said Andy Roberts, research director for global thermal coal markets at the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. He said the trend is unlikely to reverse. But it was a big, failed bet on the international coal market that ultimately pushed companies to a point where they couldn’t pay off their debts, forcing them to file for bankruptcy reorganization. About five years ago, the big coal companies  — Arch, Alpha and Peabody — took out massive loans to invest in metallurgical coal, a type found in the Appalachia region. They thought fast-growing Asian countries, particularly China, would want the coal to facilitate economic development. But China’s growth slowed, and the demand never materialized. The companies have been unable to pay back their debts on this project, and that’s what sent them into bankruptcy, Godby said. Regulations may make electricity companies apprehensive about investing in coal down the line. This is the best way to think about how environmental regulations affect coal: If you’re an electricity company considering building a new coal-powered plant or rehabilitating an outdated one, you’re already on the fence about whether that’s a good investment, because of the threat of natural gas. But then you remember you might have to face strict carbon emission limitations down the line, which convinces you to go with a natural gas plant instead of a coal plant. Take President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, a major initiative that would affect coal-powered plants by reducing carbon emissions. It isn’t in effect yet, and it faces court hurdles. Even so, the uncertainty of what kinds of carbon limitations coal plants will face, and the possibility that they could be significant, has already reduced coal plant investment, Roberts said. ""So, investment in coal plants is now basically nil,"" Roberts said. ""And when the CPP begins in earnest in 2022, coal demand, already suffering, will more rapidly and inexorably decline."" Similarly, the 2015 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards is a federal regulation that has had a significant impact on the coal industry and contributed to coal-powered plant closures. But it’s impossible to tell how much of the changes in the coal market can be attributed solely to the regulations, rather than the regulations plus the market forces. Multiple experts we asked said that so far, it’s primarily been the market putting pressure on coal. But looking toward the future, as coal becomes more vulnerable and environmental rules get bigger, regulations may play a larger role.   ""Yes, as Secretary Clinton notes, the market is sorting this out,"" Roberts said. ""Competitive natural gas, the ‘market,’ does indeed have something to do with that. But so do the CPP and federal subsidies for renewable generation. The combination of all these elements has been toxic for coal companies and lethal for those with too much debt. In reality, the ‘market’ for coal is partially economic but increasingly regulatory."" In October, Appalachian Power President Charles Patton said coal power won’t be able to rebound ""with or without the Clean Power Plan"" — the economics just don’t make sense. Our ruling Clinton said, ""The market is making this decision. The market has driven down the cost of coal, so you have companies going bankrupt."" Economic forces on both the national and international markets are the main reason coal’s prominence in the American energy sector is now vulnerable, forcing coal-burning plant closures and several high-profile bankruptcies. For a long time, coal has been impervious to government regulation. But more recently, regulations — a non-economic force — might be the straw that breaks the camel’s back, especially going forward now that coal is on shaky ground",Mostly True,"May 10, 2016"
"The Paris Agreement ""is by far the largest number of countries ever to sign an international agreement on a single day.""","Using Earth Day as a backdrop on April 22, 2016, world leaders from 175 countries signed an historic agreement for climate change. Named for the city of Paris, the agreement was signed at the United Nations headquarters in New York. Senior adviser to President Barack Obama Brian Deese attempted put the agreement into perspective in a post on Medium: ""Today, on Earth Day, nearly 170 countries will sign the Paris Agreement, reinforcing their commitment to the historic climate pact that was forged in December of last year. That’s the largest number of countries that have ever signed an international agreement in one day."" United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon made a similar claim on the same day. ""Today is an historic day,"" Ban told reporters at a press conference following the opening ceremony of the signing event in New York. ""This is by far the largest number of countries ever to sign an international agreement on a single day."" We wondered if Ban, and Deese were correct. The Paris Agreement was signed by leaders from 175 of the 193 countries in the United Nations. That is indeed a record, the United Nations confirmed. The previous benchmark was in 1982. ""In 1982, 119 countries signed the Law of the Sea Treaty. That was the record until Friday,"" said Stéphane Dujarric, a United Nations spokesman. The Law of the Sea Treaty called for technology transfers and wealth transfers from developed to undeveloped nations. It also required parties to the treaty to adopt regulations and laws to control pollution of the marine environment. There are a few caveats worth mentioning. First, signing the agreement is not the end. The leaders must now go back to their home countries' governments to ratify and approve the agreement, which could take months or years. Fifteen countries ratified the agreement immediately -- Barbados, Belize, Fiji, Grenada, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Somalia, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, State of Palestine and Tuvalu. Second, the record should be put into perspective. There are both more countries and more members of the United Nations today than ever.  Until now, the 1987 Montreal Protocol was regarded as one of the most successful international treaties of all time. It was the first treaty in history to achieve universal ratification. It is has been ratified by every member of the United Nations and was ratified by 197 governments. This protocol deals with the protection of the Earth’s fragile ozone layer. This layer protects life on Earth from some of the sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays -- and, thanks to the treaty, is set to recover completely by around 2050. But the Montreal Protocol initially was signed by just 46 governments. The Paris Agreement goes into effect once 55 countries representing at least 55 percent of global emissions formally ratify the agreement. Among other things, the agreement proposes: a  long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels; to aim to limit the increase to 1.5°C; reduce the amount of global emissions, recognizing that the process will take longer in developing countries. Our ruling Ban said, the Paris Agreement ""is by far the largest number of countries ever to sign an international agreement on a single day."" That is correct, beating the previous record when 119 countries simultaneously signed the Law of the Sea Treaty in 1982. But there are two caveats. First, Signing does not equal ratification. Countries must still do that before the agreement takes effect. Second, it’s worth noting there are more independent nations today to sign an agreement than in year’s past. The statement is accurate but needs additional information",Mostly True,"April 26, 2016"
"""Over 97 percent of the scientific community … believe that humans are contributing to climate change.""","It’s time to stop debating the science behind whether humans contribute to rising temperatures, says U.S. Rep. Don Beyer, D-8th. ""Even while over 97 percent of the scientific community and the vast majority of Americans believe that humans are contributing to climate change, a small but well-heeled cohort continues to deny and even try to discredit what objective science tells us unambiguously,"" he wrote in a March 24 post on his congressional website. This Truth-O-Meter will focus on Beyer’s claim that 97 percent of the scientific community believes humans are a cause of climate change - a figure widely cited by those urging efforts to stem global warming. Climate change skeptics repeatedly have said the figure is not credible. We asked Beyer for the source of his statistic. His spokesman, Thomas Scanlon, pointed to several articles in scientific journals, information from NASA, and other sources about climate change. Let’s start with NASA. Here’s what its website says: ""Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree: Climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities. In addition, most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position."" So the federal space agency notes that the 97 percent figure more narrowly focuses on ""actively publishing climate scientists."" That’s different from Beyer’s broad contention that 97 percent the entire ""scientific community"" thinks humans contribute to global warming. Still, this leaves us with the question: What are the sources for the 97 percent? NASA points to several of them in a footnote on its website. Cook study The first is a 2013 study by John Cook, a fellow at the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland in Australia. He and his co-authors examined 11,944 abstracts of climate science reports published from 1991 to 2011. Two-thirds of the abstracts didn’t express any opinion about whether man-made global warming was occurring. But among the roughly 4,000 studies that did, 97.1 percent of them ""endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming,"" the report says. Cook also asked a sample of 1,200 authors of the climate reports to rate their own papers and say whether their research agreed that global warming was man-made. The result was that 97.2 percent of the papers that expressed an opinion about man-made global warming backed the position that it’s caused by human activity. Cook’s methodology has been criticized. Tol study Richard Tol, a professor with the Institute for Environmental Studies in Amsterdam, rejects the 97 percent figure. In a 2014 article, he said it was based on an unrepresentative sample of climate science papers that took into account only one-quarter of the climate research available. Tol had other misgivings about the Australian researcher’s methodology. In re-running the figures, Tol found that some 91 percent of climate research papers that Cook’s team examined supported the consensus that man is the main reason for the Earth’s warming temperatures. Despite taking aim at the specificity of the 97 percent figure, Tol said he agrees there indeed is a large consensus that warming temperatures are the result of human activity. ""There is no doubt in my mind that the literature on climate change overwhelmingly supports the hypothesis that climate change is caused by humans,"" Tol wrote. ""I have very little reason to doubt that the consensus is indeed correct. Cook et al., however, failed to demonstrate this."" In a reply, Cook re-examined the data and stood by his paper’s conclusions in a 2014 post on his blog, Skeptical Science. University of Illinois study Beyond this debate, NASA also cites a January 2009 study by researchers at the University of Illinois. They surveyed 3,146 earth scientists and asked two questions: Was global warming occurring? Was human activity a ""significant contributing factor"" for changes in the Earth’s temperatures? Nine out of 10 of the scientists said the Earth’s temperatures had risen, and 82 percent said human activities were a key reason. Winnowing the field to climate change researchers who actively published their results, the survey found that 75 of 77 of them, or 97.4 percent, said human activity is a significant driver of climate change. That latter figure also has come under criticism because of its small sample size. National Academy of Sciences Another study published in 2010 by the National Academy of Sciences created a database of  908 climate researchers who had their work published at least 20 times in scientific journals. The study found roughly 90 percent of the climate researchers were convinced that rising temperatures are being caused by human activity, while 10 percent were not convinced. But the more expertise the researchers had, the greater their consensus. Looking at the top 200 researchers, based on the number of articles they published, just 2.5 percent of them were unconvinced climate change was mostly the result of human activity, the study found. That left ""97–98% of the climate researchers most actively publishing in the field surveyed"" convinced that rising temperatures were mostly due to humans, the report said. Conversely, the study found that the expertise of researchers who weren’t convinced of man-made global warming was ""substantially below that of the convinced researchers."" Bill Anderegg, the PNAS report’s lead author, told us in an email that ""the quote from (Beyer) is absolutely consistent with the scientific literature on this."" We also found a 2013 poll of roughly 1,800 meteorologists by the American Meteorological Society found that 73 percent of those surveyed felt that humans contributed to global warming. But for the more active publishing climate science experts within that group, 93 percent believed that humans were contributing to global warming. Our ruling Beyer said ""over 97 percent of the scientific community"" believe humans are contributing to climate change. The studies Beyer and others cite do not reflect the scientific community at large. They are surveys that focus on the conclusions of climatologists, earth scientists and meteorologists. The studies found that overwhelming majorities of these experts - sometimes, but not always as high as 97 percent - say humans are contributing to global warming. Beyer’s statement is credible but needs elaboration",Mostly True,"April 4, 2016"
"""The Clean Power Plan is something that Sen. Sanders has said he would delay implementing.""","Debating in a city where rising sea levels are a concern, Hillary Clinton suggested Bernie Sanders wants to set back a major climate change policy of the Obama administration. ""The Clean Power Plan is something that Sen. Sanders has said he would delay implementing, which makes absolutely no sense,"" Clinton said. ""What? Tsk,"" Sanders said, laughing and shaking his head incredulously. ""Wait, what?"" was our reaction too. Looking at statements and actions by Sanders, Clinton’s statement is misleading. Briefly, the Clean Power Plan aims to cut carbon emissions from coal-burning power plants by 2030 by 32 percent from 2005 levels, promoting clean(er) energy sources instead. This plan, hailed and criticized as a historic environmental initiative, was put on hold on Feb. 9, 2016, by the U.S. Supreme Court. We searched Google, LexisNexis and CQ for comments Sanders has made on the plan and found no evidence that Sanders has said he wants to delay the implementation. The Clinton campaign referred us to Sanders’ Feb. 21 interview with Grist, an environmental online magazine, in which he laid out what President Sanders would likely do on climate change. Sanders said he would change the Clean Power Plan to incentivize renewables instead of gas and extend a two-year program for wind and solar credits all the way to 2030. And beyond carbon, he would also regulate methane through the plan. The Clinton campaign also cited environmental law expert Richard Revesz’s blog post for The Hill criticizing Sanders. The Clean Power Plan ""cannot be changed at the stroke of the pen,"" Revesz wrote a few days after the Grist interview, and Sanders’ actions would ""stop the train and cause a great delay."" (Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor, made the same argument.) But Sanders himself did not say he would delay implementation. In reality, he wants a more ambitious plan (and has released one) and has supported Obama’s plan from the get-go. A day before it was unveiled, Sanders said in a press release, ""It sounds to me like a step forward in ending our dependence on fossil fuel, and I support that effort."" He also tweeted that day, ""Pres Obama knows climate change is the great planetary crisis facing us & we must move boldly to transform our energy system #CleanPowerPlan."" And in November, Sanders voted twice against legislation to block the Clean Power Plan. ""It is an embarrassment that with few exceptions Republicans refuse to recognize the reality of climate change, and even fewer are prepared to do anything about it,"" he wrote in a press release following the effort to repeal the plan. ""Today’s vote to block the Clean Power Plan is a stark reminder that instead of worrying about the future of our planet, Republicans are more concerned with their campaign contributions."" Our ruling Clinton said, ""The Clean Power Plan is something that Sen. Sanders has said he would delay implementing."" Sanders advocates for more ambitious action on climate change, which some experts argue could delay the plan. But Sanders himself has never said what Clinton is suggesting, and he has supported the Clean Power Act in words and action",False,"March 10, 2016"
"""There is not a single candidate in the Republican primary that thinks we should do anything about climate change.""","Foreign leaders are ""troubled"" by some of the rhetoric coming out of the Republican presidential primary, and it’s not just what they’re hearing from Donald Trump, says President Barack Obama. ""But this is not just Mr. Trump. Look at the statements that are being made by the other candidates,"" Obama said at a Feb. 16 news conference. ""There is not a single candidate in the Republican primary that thinks we should do anything about climate change, that thinks it’s serious. Well, that's a problem. The rest of the world looks at that and says, how can that be?"" Obama’s statement sounded similar to a take from Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, who recently said, ""Not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real."" We rated that claim False because a couple GOP presidential candidates (including some who are no longer in the running) have acknowledged its existence. Obama’s claim is different: He said none of the Republicans thinks the country should do anything about climate change. To different degrees, the remaining candidates don’t believe man-made climate change is happening, or at least not to the extent that Obama and a vast majority of climate scientists believe it’s happening. All of the Republican candidates — Donald Trump, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, John Kasich and Ben Carson — call for scaling back environmental and energy regulations. Some support going through the private sector for renewable energy source development, alongside continued development of fossil fuels, and environmental protection. But none have a fleshed-out plan to specifically address the issue of climate change. Here’s where the remaining Republican presidential candidates stand on climate change and what they propose to do (or not do) about it. Donald Trump Trump has said repeatedly that he does not believe in climate change, even suggesting it’s a conspiracy invented by China to make the United States less competitive. His website doesn’t have any information on his plans to combat climate change or how he would approach energy issues. He has said he would abolish the Environmental Protection Agency, and the environment will be ""fine."" When MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough asked Trump in November what he would do about climate change, Trump did not outline a specific plan, but he said, ""We want to have clean air to breathe and we want to have beautiful clean water. That's very important to me."" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Rubio believes the climate is changing, but he questions how much of it is man-made. ""The climate has always changed,"" Rubio said in January. ""There’s never been a time when the climate has not been changing."" He has criticized international climate efforts, as well as Obama’s regulatory measures, saying they are more damaging to the economy than they are helpful to the environment. ""If you’re overly dependent on any one source of fuel, then you become vulnerable to disruption,"" he said at the same event in January. ""I want America to truly have a truly all-of-the-above strategy."" Rubio has not released a plan to quell the effects of climate change. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas Cruz believes man-made climate change is not real. He has called it a ""pseudoscientific theory"" and has criticized Obama for calling it a major security threat. His website says he would abolish the Energy Department and eliminate at least 10 existing climate change and environmental programs. Like Rubio, he calls for an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy, meaning he supports development of fossil fuels as well as renewable resources, which he says amounts to an ""energy renaissance."" ""We must harness our nation’s energy resources and remove federal impediments to energy exploration, development and trade,"" he wrote. Ben Carson Carson does not believe in man-made climate change. He has said it’s part of a natural cycle and cannot be ""an excuse not to develop our own God-given natural resources."" His energy plan calls for reducing government regulations on energy production, including fossil fuels that contribute to climate change, but also developing renewable fuels. He also calls on people to be stewards of the environment, but not at the expense of jobs and the economy. He did tell Time in October 2015 that if there is ""clear-cut evidence"" that a certain manufacturing practice is causing significant harm to the environment, President Carson might take some action. ""I would use the EPA to work with business industry and academia to find the cleanest, most environmentally friendly way to do things, rather than just all right, we’re coming in here and we’re shutting you down,"" he said. Ohio Gov. John Kasich As recently as Feb. 29, Kasich has said he believes there is a climate change problem, acknowledging he is going against the grain of his party. But he has not proposed a full-fledged strategy to address it, and his fact sheet on energy does not mention climate change. He has, though called for pursuing renewable energy sources as one possible response. In August, he questioned the extent of man’s impact on the environment, calling full-blown climate change ""some theory that is not proven."" He said he wouldn’t want to destroy any jobs in order to address these concerns. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush Bush has dropped out of the race, but we’re including him because he was still in the running when Obama made his statement. He believes climate change is real and human activity is a contributing factor. He had an energy plan but not a specific environmental protection plan. He has argued that some of the Obama administration’s regulations go too far, such as Obama’s Clean Power Plan. Like most of the other Republican candidates, he called for reducing regulations and increasing growth in the energy sector, both fossil fuel and renewable sources. ""Energy resources must be developed in a way that protects human health and the environment,"" his energy plan said. ""Rules play an important role in making sure this is the case. But the Obama administration’s excessive rules too often usurp state and tribal authority and go beyond what is necessary."" Our ruling Obama said, ""There is not a single candidate in the Republican primary that thinks we should do anything about climate change."" None of the remaining Republican presidential candidates have laid out a specific plan to address climate change. All of them call for scaling back Obama’s environmental regulations, to boot. Some have called for private-sector development of renewable energy sources. Bush, who was in the race when Obama made his comment, and Kasich both have said they believe human-caused climate change is real and have said pursuing these alternative energy sources could mitigate the problem. But neither has outlined a specific plan. For some Republican voters, this stance might be a plus. But it doesn’t change the veracity of Obama’s statement",Mostly True,"March 1, 2016"
"""Our community (Tampa Bay) is one of the 10 most threatened by the sea level rise in the world.""","The head of Tampa Bay’s Sierra Club chapter warned the Hillsborough County Commission that building more roads will only make global warming’s consequences worse for the entire region. Chapter chairman Kent Bailey told commissioners in a Feb. 22, 2016, letter that the Sierra Club would not be supporting a proposed half-cent transportation sales tax referendum known as Go Hillsborough. Bailey said the measure doesn’t set aside enough money to pay for expanding mass transit. He argued that adding more roads and more cars to an already congested system will only make matters worse by increasing carbon pollution. ""Our community is one of the 10 most threatened by the sea level rise in the world,"" Bailey wrote. He added that the Tampa Bay area will be among the first to suffer from flooding caused by climate change.  There’s no doubt the oceans are rising, and Tampa Bay will feel the effects. But is the region among the most endangered in the world? Let’s just say that we found the bay area has a lot to lose. Flooding vs. sea level rise There are a bunch of ways to measure how climate change will affect the world’s cities. People will be displaced, economies will be ruined, or you may end up with not enough water (or too much). These are all issues Tampa Bay faces, so buckle up. When we asked Bailey how he came up with his ranking, he said he was referring to potential property losses, mostly in terms of real estate. ""We can move our people. But our fixed assets are a different story,"" he said. He cited several sources, including a report from global-warming researchers Climate Central, and a Scientific American article that said St. Petersburg was in particular danger from sea level rise.   He also pointed to a 2008 paper from the international Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The study focused on the effects of climate extremes on port cities — particularly storm surge. Coastal flooding is different than sea level rise, but experts told us Bailey is using a fair benchmark for comparison. Vulnerability to storm surge and sea level rise often are conflated in discussions on climate change, they said. ""They are related, but not exactly the same,"" said Ben Strauss, vice president for sea level and climate impacts at Climate Central. In general, sea level rise can make a big impact on flooding, and will assuredly make storm surges and flooding worse in the future. David Hastings, a marine science professor at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, said storm surges are especially dangerous in Tampa and St. Petersburg because of the relatively shallow offshore shelf in the Gulf of Mexico. Higher sea levels will make surges even more dangerous. But back to the OECD study: Economists examined 136 port cities and found that Tampa and St. Petersburg together were among the 10 cities with the most property at risk to wind damage and coastal flooding from storm surge. And that’s for right now, let alone after sea levels increase. ""The top 10 cities in terms of assets exposed are Miami, Greater New York, New Orleans, Osaka-Kobe, Tokyo, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Nagoya, Tampa-St. Petersburg and Virginia Beach,"" the paper read.  Those rankings could get better if steps were taken to mitigate flooding, the study said. But they could also get worse, as cities grow and gain more people. The effects of subsidence (the physical earth below the city changing or sinking, which is a major issue in Tampa Bay) and the changing climate could magnify the risk, too. Many of the same economists revisited the rankings in a 2013 study published in the journal Nature Climate Change. Tampa-St. Petersburg came in as the seventh-most at risk of flooding. If you’re looking for a price tag for how much Tampa Bay stands to lose, the OECD has one: In a catastrophic, once-in-100-years flood, losses to the region currently could be $49.6 billion. University of South Florida oceanography professor Gary Mitchum noted real estate losses are only part of the story. As the oceans rise permanently, the region’s tourism-based economy will suffer extensively. Many people who can afford to simply move away probably will, but low-wage workers dependent on disappearing service industry jobs will be stuck. Of course, the region’s property loss ranking may change some as population, planning and even geography shift. But these are from economists, considering economic impact. If we examined this another way — say, how many people will be permanently displaced by the eventual coastal floods that won’t recede — other places will have it much worse than Tampa Bay. Even the OECD researchers said their rankings would be different by that measure. Cities in China and southeast Asian countries, like Bangladesh and Vietnam, will be much more affected that way. It’s much harder to quantify how the human toll will affect regions because you can’t easily attach a dollar amount to it. ""The social impact of this is much more complicated,"" Mitchum said. ""The result that you get depends on how you assess it."" Our ruling Sierra Club's Bailey said, ""Our community (Tampa Bay) is one of the 10 most threatened by the sea level rise in the world."" He cited credible research that showed the region is among the most at risk of property damage from coastal flooding. He’s conflating that research with the effects of sea level rise, but several experts told us the problems are related. It's striking that Tampa Bay is already in great danger when it comes to potential property loss, but Bailey should have been more specific. There are other ways to measure the consequences of rising oceans beyond real estate. When we consider some of these factors, other major cities could be considered worse off than Tampa Bay.

""Do you think there's a reason why not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real, and that we need to transform our energy system? Do you think it has anything to do with the Koch brothers and ExxonMobil pouring huge amounts of money into the political system? That is what goes on in America."" Not one Republican recognizes that climate change is real? We decided to look at the positions of the GOP candidates who were in the race when Sanders made his statement. The climate change question has several elements. Some candidates acknowledge that Earth's climate has changed in recent decades but insist that natural forces — not human activity — are responsible. Some acknowledge that humans are playing a significant role in climate change but argue that there's little the United States can do by itself to reverse the global warming trend. Others are pushing for specific proposals to address the issue. So where do the Republican candidates stand? Last August, NPR produced a chart showing how all the candidates viewed the various aspects of the climate question. In addition, we repeatedly emailed all the candidates' campaigns to see if that chart was still accurate and whether there were additional nuances that had surfaced in the intervening six months. We heard from the Chris Christie, Carly Fiorina and John Kasich campaigns. Spokespeople for Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Donald Trump didn't respond. We also checked their campaign websites for updated information on how they felt about the climate change question. On the issue of whether climate has been changing significantly in recent decades, Bush, Christie, Fiorina, Kasich and Rubio say that it has. Bush, Christie, Fiorina and Kasich say it's man made. Rubio says it's not. Bush, Christie, Fiorina and Kasich have called for some degree of action to combat it. For example, Christie's campaign sent us comments from an April town hall meeting in Exeter, N.H., where the candidate said, ""I don’t believe we can do this on our own. We have to have cooperation with the rest of the world. If America changes its behavior and puts up with the economic ramifications that will happen from changing that behavior in the short term, the rest of the world has to engage in it with us."" Fiorina's campaign made a similar point, quoting the candidate on CNBC in September as saying that innovation would be the key: ""That's how you're going to solve an intractable problem. It's always the way you solve an intractable problem. Not with regulation — with innovation."" She made the same point during a Nov. 16 town hall meeting. Bush in July said humans have contributed to climate change. ""The climate is changing; I don’t think anybody can argue it’s not,"" Bush told Bloomberg. ""Human activity has contributed to it. I think we have a responsibility to adapt to what the possibilities are without destroying our economy, without hollowing out our industrial core.""   So clearly, some GOP candidates are not denying the problem at all. During the debate, Sanders referred to ""Republicans,"" not the GOP presidential candidates. But two days earlier, at an event in Keene, N.H., he specifically said, ""We do not have one Republican candidate for president acknowledging this (climate change) reality."" Even if he was referring to party supporters in general, a 2013 Pew poll found that 23 percent of people who lean Republican say there is solid evidence that Earth is warming and human activity is responsible. And a 2013 bipartisan poll found that 53 percent of Republican voters under age 35 picked either ""crazy,"" ""ignorant"" or ""out of touch"" to describe someone who denies that climate change is happening. Since those polls, the evidence for warming has only gotten stronger, with NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration saying that Earth’s 2015 surface temperatures were the warmest since modern record keeping began in 1880. When we asked the Sanders campaign about the claim, policy director Warren Gunnels said, ""The reality is that none of the Republicans have introduced a plan to solve climate change in a way that would transform our energy system. ... Go look at all of their websites.  None of them have a plan."" Actually, some of the GOP candidates have posted plans that deal with energy issues, although they don't go in the direction that Sanders and scientists concerned about climate change might like. Bush's website, for example, calls for the repeal or reform of the Carbon Rule, which is President Barack Obama's executive order requiring coal-fired power plants to dramatically reduce their carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. Rubio wants to get rid of some anti-pollution rules and use the free market, not government regulation, to encourage ""environmental conservation, fuel efficiency and energy diversity."" Others say little if anything on the issue. Christie's website seems to be silent on the matter. The ""climate change"" section of Kasich's website has a video saying that he cares about the environment. Carson's website simply says, ""Earth is in a constantly cycle of warming or cooling,"" Some are downright hostile. Cruz's website belittles climate change activists and calls for an end to the regulation of carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and all other sources and an end to the ""regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles",False Pants on Fire,"February 9, 2016"
"Says Donald Trump ""thinks that climate change is a hoax, invented by the Chinese.""","For the second time in a week on national TV, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders attacked Republican candidate Donald Trump by citing Trump’s views on climate change. Trump ""thinks that climate change is a hoax, invented by the Chinese,"" Sanders said Jan. 24 on NBC’s Meet the Press, echoing a similar statement he made in the Democratic presidential debate in Charleston, S.C. (Watch the clip.) Did Trump really say that? He definitely tweeted that view once in 2012, though he has since distanced himself a bit from that theory. The clearest example comes from a tweet sent by Trump on Nov. 6, 2012. ""The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.""  So Sanders certainly has evidence to support his claim. But Trump has somewhat backed off after Sanders' comments, calling the Chinese link a ""joke."" On Jan. 18, after Sanders had attacked Trump’s climate change views in the Democratic debate, Trump told Fox & Friends, ""Well, I think the climate change is just a very, very expensive form of tax. A lot of people are making a lot of money. I know much about climate change. I'd be — received environmental awards. And I often joke that this is done for the benefit of China. Obviously, I joke. But this is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change. They burn everything you could burn; they couldn't care less. They have very — you know, their standards are nothing. But they — in the meantime, they can undercut us on price. So it's very hard on our business."" So Trump has said his 2012 tweet was a joke. However, he has used the word ""hoax"" repeatedly in describing climate change, although he doesn’t always fault China. (For the record, in 2014 we rated the claim that climate change is a ""hoax"" Pants on Fire.) Most recently, on Dec. 30, 2015, Trump told the crowd at a rally in Hilton Head, S.C., ""Obama's talking about all of this with the global warming and … a lot of it's a hoax. It's a hoax. I mean, it's a money-making industry, OK? It's a hoax, a lot of it."" That’s three times using ""hoax"" in one sentence. Trump has also used the word on Twitter since that 2012 tweet. On Jan. 25, 2014, Trump tweeted, ""NBC News just called it the great freeze — coldest weather in years. Is our country still spending money on the GLOBAL WARMING HOAX?""  On Jan. 29, 2014, Trump tweeted: ""Snowing in Texas and Louisiana, record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond. Global warming is an expensive hoax!""  That same day, he tweeted, ""Give me clean, beautiful and healthy air - not the same old climate change (global warming) bullshit! I am tired of hearing this nonsense.""  Trump also called climate change a ""hoax"" on Jan. 6, 2014, edition of Fox & Friends. Trump said on Sept. 24, 2015, on CNN’s New Day, ""I don’t believe in climate change."" And as we noted earlier, even when calling his earlier tweet a joke, Trump on Jan. 18, 2016, said that climate change ""is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change."" Our ruling Sanders said that Trump ""thinks that climate change is a hoax, invented by the Chinese."" Trump did tweet that view in 2012. Whether Trump still feels that way is less clear. Asked about it recently, the real estate developer called it a joke. However, Trump has repeatedly called climate change a ""hoax"" in speeches, tweets and media appearances, and while he hasn’t necessarily repeated the charge that China ""invented"" climate change, he has said as recently as Jan. 18, 2016, that action on climate change ""is done for the benefit of China",Mostly True,"January 24, 2016"
"""In reality, gas produced by fracking is worse for the climate than coal.""","The Environmental Justice League of Rhode Island asserts that a new liquefied natural gas facility at Fields Point would accelerate climate change. The league’s position paper, posted at RIFuture.org, predicts that the storage facility proposed by National Grid would increase emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.  ""While the oil and gas industry and their supporters like to present ‘natural gas’ as a ‘cleaner’ alternative or a ‘bridge fuel’ towards a renewable future, in reality, gas produced by fracking is worse for the climate than coal,"" the paper says. So coal is cleaner than natural gas? The primary source for this material is Cornell University’s Robert W. Howarth, who has researched the climate-warming effects of methane that escapes into the atmosphere during the lifespan of fracked gas — from drilling to combustion.   In fracking, water is pumped underground at high pressure to fracture shale to free up gas or oil. Methane is released in the process. The impact of gases — methane from coal-burning plants and carbon dioxide from automobiles — depends on how potent they are and how long they remain in the atmosphere. Methane is 100 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas during the 10 years following its emission, according to Howarth. But methane stays in the atmosphere for a little more than a decade, while carbon dioxide, some say, hangs around for 1,000 years. The point, Howarth says, is that global warming has moved into a critical period. It’s urgent, he says, to stave off what he calls ""runaway global warming"" — a scenario he believes is possible during the next 20 years. In the short-term, fracked gas is worse for the climate than coal-burning. Reducing methane emissions, he wrote to us in an email, is the only way to keep atmospheric temperatures below the 2 degrees Celsius mark set during last month’s accord at the Paris climate conference. ""Methane emissions from fracked shale gas are horrendously high; so yes, it’s unequivocally worse for the climate than is coal,"" Howarth says. Other scientists disagree. In 2014, Raymond Pierrehumbert, a geoscientist at the University of Chicago, presented research that shows carbon dioxide ""is in a class by itself"" among greenhouse pollutants. The lifetime of carbon dioxide, says the paper, can’t even be characterized, and the gas’s significant greenhouse effects ""persist for millennia."" Pierrehumbert likens the greenhouse effects of carbon dioxide to irreversible lead poisoning and the effects of methane gas to a hangover. ""The important thing to note,"" Pierrehumbert was quoted as saying in an online post for The New York Times, ""is that essentially all of the climate effects of methane emissions disappear within 20 years of cessation of emissions. In this sense, the climate harm caused by methane leakage is reversible. In contrast, CO2 accumulates in the atmosphere, ratcheting up the temperature irreversibly, at least out to several millennia."" In a different online Times post, Louis A. Derry, a Cornell colleague of Howarth’s, and an associate professor in earth and academic sciences, was quoted as saying that between 2007 and 2011, the climate impact from increased carbon dioxide was 13 times greater than that of methane. ""For me, the picture is pretty clear,"" he wrote, ""Displacing coal emissions with gas emissions is beneficial from a climate standpoint."" Another prominent climate expert, James Hansen of Columbia University, recently acknowledged that gas can serve as a temporary alternative to burning coal.  Does this mean natural gas, including fracked gas, is better for climate than coal-burning? Hansen said that he would need to know more about methane emissions. ""I'm not sure anybody has it nailed down,"" said Hansen, the former NASA climatologist whose testimony before Congress in 1988 helped spread awareness of global warming. If he had to guess, Hansen said, the negative side effects of producing natural gas are small compared to those of burning coal, ""or they could be made small."" Pierrehumbert, Howarth, Hansen agree on one thing: the safest path is to develop more renewable energy such as wind and solar. Our ruling The Environmental Justice League of Rhode Island asserts: ""...in reality gas produced by fracking is worse for the climate than coal."" The chairman of the University of Rhode Island’s geosciences department, David Fast-Ovsky, agrees with Pierrehumbert and shares many of Howarth’s concerns, too. But without appropriate historical context, he says he isn’t ready to say that fracked gas is worse for the climate than coal. That is a very aggressive statement to make, he says. The Justice League did not qualify its claim with a nod to the transient nature of methane emissions. The league mentioned a concern about the potential for ""runaway climate change,"" but did not give the historical context behind Howarth’s assertion that a failure to control methane emissions in the short-term, within the next 20 years, makes fracked gas more damaging to climate. This is complicated stuff and the League oversimplified. ""The statement is not false and it’s not exactly true because it’s not well-constrained,"" says Fast-Ovsky. We agree with Fast-Ovsky",True,"January 24, 2016"
"Says President Barack Obama’s homeland security budget had ""$16 million to fight climate change"" but ""didn't have a line item to fight violent extremism.""","A remark by U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy about President Barack Obama, climate change and violent extremism was so startling that an interviewer made a point to repeat it. And it made us wonder: Does the Department of Homeland Security really spend a bunch of money on climate change but doesn’t make it a priority to fight ""violent extremism?"" The Wisconsin Republican made his claim Dec. 9, 2015 after being asked about the terrorism in San Bernardino and how to fight such domestic threats. ""When the president sent over his budget to the House of Representatives, he had a homeland security budget,"" Duffy said on ""Varney & Co.,"" a talk show on Fox Business Network. ""He put $16 million to fight climate change in Homeland Security, and didn't have a line item to fight violent extremism. The president doesn’t take this seriously."" The claim surprised host Stuart Varney. ""That’s very important, Sean,"" Varney replied. Obama's budget for the Department of Homeland Security had $16 million for climate change ""but nothing extra, that we know about, to fight and find these guys who are already here? That's the situation?"" Varney asked. ""That is the situation,"" Duffy said. Well, not really. There is no line item in the Department of Homeland Security budget for fighting violent extremists -- defined by the department as ""individuals who support or commit ideologically-motivated violence to further political goals."" A line item can signify whether something is a priority, as Duffy argues. But his claim is misleading in that DHS, as well as other federal departments, spend money to fight violent extremism. Climate change To back the claim, Duffy’s office cited PolitiFact National’s May 2015 fact check of U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. McCaul had said more money is dedicated within the Department of Homeland Security to climate change than what's spent combating ""Islamist terrorists radicalizing over the Internet in the United States of America."" Our colleagues rated the statement Mostly True. But Duffy’s claim is much broader -- about fighting violent extremism generally, rather than spending specifically to fight Islamist terrorists over the Internet. Our colleagues found that the Department of Homeland Security’s budget for fiscal 2016 arguably included $16 million for climate change. That figure was part of Duffy’s claim. There is $10 million ""for analyses of climate change impacts on infrastructure critical to national and economic security, and national public health and safety."" And $6 million for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is part of homeland security, for ""climate workshops and regional resilience coordination"" done by FEMA. And while the Department of Homeland Security has a senior-level official who serves as the coordinator of Countering Violent Extremism, that office has no separate line item in the budget. But just because there isn’t a line in a budget doesn’t mean the department is ignoring violent extremism. A few examples from the Department of Homeland Security’s budget: Four to eight full-time staff assigned to countering violent extremism. $1 million for a database to analyze past violent extremist incidents and see what sort of programs work best to head off attacks. Part of the department’s $1 billion National Preparedness Grant Program to state and local governments can be spent on projects to spot early signs of terrorist planning. Said Duffy spokeswoman Cassie Smedile: Four to eight staffers isn’t a sign of a high priority to ""when you consider that DHS employs more than 240,000 people."" Fair point. But does the average citizen necessarily care which department’s federal employees are involved in fighting violent extremism? The Department of Homeland Security works with federal and local agencies on countering violent extremism. And the Justice Department has a $15 million line item for countering violent extremism, including $4 million for ""domestic radicalization research."" Our rating Duffy said Obama’s homeland security budget had ""$16 million to fight climate change"" but ""didn't have a line item to fight violent extremism."" There is no line item in the Department of Homeland Security budget for fighting violent extremism. But that ignores the fact that millions of dollars are allocated, inside and outside the Department of Homeland Security, to counter violent extremists",Mostly False,"December 18, 2015"
"""Mike Morell testified and told Congress that the reason Obama has not bombed ISIS' oil fields is they're concerned about global warming.""","Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz tore into President Barack Obama’s strategy against ISIS in an NPR interview. Cruz, who vowed to ""utterly destroy ISIS"" and ""carpet bomb them into oblivion,"" said Obama is not serious about defeating the jihadists. The Texas senator brought up Obama’s former CIA deputy director, Mike Morell, to show how Obama has prioritized a green agenda instead. ""Mike Morell testified and told Congress that the reason Obama has not bombed ISIS' oil fields is they're concerned about global warming,"" Cruz said on Dec. 8’s Morning Edition. ""This is nonsense."" Is it true that Morell said the Obama administration refused to strike ISIS’ oil assets because of fears that emissions from oil fires will contribute to global warming, the term for increased temperatures believed to be linked to human activity? Not exactly. Cruz gets several details wrong, starting with what Morell said and where he said it. His overall point is misleading and, in the words of one expert, ""completely nonsensical.""    Bombs and black gold We’ll start with an overview of ISIS’ oil assets and what’s been bombed. ISIS has hijacked the bulk of Syria’s oil, which has become a major cash cow for the terrorist group’s operations. (Other prominent sources of revenue include taxation and extortion, sales of looted property, bank robberies, kidnapping ransoms and state-run businesses.) With about a half-dozen oil fields under its control, ISIS churns out an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 barrels per day and makes $1.5 million to $2 million daily from oil sales. U.S. and coalition military forces have been trying to get at this revenue source by periodically targeting oil assets for over a year. From the start of the operation against ISIS in August 2014 to Nov. 13, 2015, airstrikes have damaged or destroyed 260 oil infrastructure targets, according to the Defense Department.   These strikes were initially aimed at easy targets like mobile refineries and storage depots, and not entirely successful, a Pentagon official admitted. So attacks were ramped up to focus on more sensitive targets like tanker trucks and wellheads. In October 2015, the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS launched a second campaign specifically aimed to cut two-thirds of the terrorists’ oil revenue. By Dec. 1, military forces had destroyed wells, processing facilities and nearly 400 ISIS oil trucks, according to Defense Secretary Ash Carter. ""We've seen the U.S. get a lot more creative and aggressive with its target list,"" said Matthew Reed, vice president of Foreign Reports, a Washington-based consultant firm specializing in Middle East oil politics. ""It has had to overcome a learning curve. It's still learning what to hit and where."" Misquoting Morell? Did a top CIA official admit that these attacks were limited because of climate change concerns? The Cruz campaign didn't get back to us. Our search of congressional transcripts did not turn up any instance of Morell giving congressional testimony on this point. Cruz could be thinking of comments by Morell on PBS’ Charlie Rose on Nov. 23. Here’s what Morell said: Morell: ""So prior to Paris, there seemed to be a judgment — I don’t sit in the Sit. Room (sic) anymore — but there seemed to have been a judgment that, look, we don't want to destroy these oil tankers because that's infrastructure that's going to be necessary to support the people when ISIS isn't there anymore. ""And it's going to create environmental damage. And we didn't go after oil wells — actually hitting oil wells that ISIS controls because we didn't want to do environmental damage and we didn’t want to destroy that infrastructure."" Rose: ""So we’re hitting oil on trucks."" Morell: ""So now we're hitting oil on trucks. And maybe you get to the point where you say we also have to hit oil wells. So those are the kind of tough decisions you have to make."" Cruz flubs Morell’s comments in a few ways. First, Morell was talking about oil tankers and wells under ISIS’ control, not ""oil fields."" That term can refer to the underground reservoirs of petroleum or the broader oil infrastructure sitting atop (i.e. refineries, tanks and other collection and transportation equipment). As we noted, military forces have been hitting some oil assets. Second, Morell made no mention of global warming. Instead, he said the oil tankers and wells were spared out of concern for ""environmental damage."" Based on previous comments by Pentagon officials and experts we talked to, Morell was more likely referring to oil spills and destroying the local environment. That’s a far cry from climate change. Limitations and concerns The attacks on ISIS oil have been limited by many concerns. But based on statements by Pentagon officials and experts, the list doesn’t include global warming. The first attacks, for example, were aimed at damaging, not completely destroying, mobile refineries and other equipment in order to keep the infrastructure intact for an ISIS-less future, not out of environmental concerns.   ""We'd like to preserve the flexibility for those refineries to still contribute to a stable economy in what we hope will be a stable country when the Assad regime is not in control anymore,"" a Pentagon spokesperson told reporters in September 2014, adding that the attacks may have actually caused some oil fires. Oil wells and tanker trucks were initially off limits in order to avoid civilian casualties, according to news reports. Even when these became fair game in October 2015, permanent destruction still wasn’t the goal. ""We have to be cognizant that there will be a time after the war -- the war will end,"" another Pentagon spokesperson said in November 2015. ""So we don't want to completely and utterly destroy these facilities to where they’re irreparable."" Experts told us this policy is humanitarian and tactical. Injuring or killing civilians or crippling the economy would be counterproductive to the goal of isolating the enemy from the local population, said Ben Bahney, an analyst at the RAND Corporation, a global policy think tank. ""The Pentagon doesn't care about ISIS' carbon footprint,"" Reed of Foreign Reports said. ""They do care about how airstrikes impact locals who are trapped inside ISIS territory. Because the potential for environmental and humanitarian disaster is so high, the U.S. uses precision strikes."" That’s precisely why bombing the physical oil fields themselves would be a ""terrible idea,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. The ecological fallout, health hazards and permanently weakened economy would impact local people. ""If it were just global warming, we would obviously bomb them,"" he said. ""If you’re worried about climate change, you should be stopping oil production period. If you bomb the well heads, you prevent the oil from being extracted so that would actually help reduce emissions,"" Bahney said. ""Cruz’s claim is completely nonsensical."" The Cruz campaign did not respond to requests for comment. Our ruling Cruz said, ""Mike Morell testified and told Congress that the reason Obama has not bombed ISIS' oil fields is they're concerned about global warming."" We found no instances of Morell testifying before Congress on this point. He did talk about Obama’s ISIS strategy on PBS, but Cruz misquotes what he said. Morell said U.S. military forces spared oil tankers and wells — not ""oil fields"" — in order to avoid ""environmental damage."" Preserving the environment for the local population is quite different from global warming, which no officials have brought up as a deterrent from bombing ISIS. The U.S. military has been striking oil assets but it has limited those strikes out of concern for civilian casualties, destroying the oil infrastructure and doing damage to the local environment. If climate change was the Obama administration’s top priority, experts said, it would make more sense to bomb the oil fields",False,"December 14, 2015"
"California has ""robust job growth that outpaces the rest of the nation."""," Top California Democrats like State Senate leader Kevin de León often claim that the state’s economy is humming right along — and not weighed down by their ambitious new clean energy requirements. Critics, particularly the oil industry, consider the state’s clean energy push detrimental to California’s economy and job outlook. So, it’s not a surprise that De León, author of the state’s most recent clean energy law, touted California’s strong job growth during a recent speech abroad about climate change. De León, D-Los Angeles, spoke about California’s role as a leader in the fight against climate change to members of Parliament in the United Kingdom. He told them California has ""robust job growth that outpaces the rest of the nation, all while reducing carbon emissions and cleaning up the air we breathe,"" according to a November press release from the senator’s office. California’s employment picture has certainly improved from the Great Recession, when it lost more than a million jobs from 2007 to 2009. Economists credit a rebound in housing and construction jobs plus strong tech sector growth for the state’s healthier employment figures. But, we wondered, is the state seeing job growth that truly ""outpaces the rest of the nation,"" as the senator claimed? Or did his statement exaggerate the state’s good job news? We set out on a fact check limited to this question. We did not evaluate the additional question of how the state’s clean energy rules have affected California’s job growth. Photo by Andrew Nixon/Capital Public Radio Our research Economists we spoke with said De León’s statement, on its face, is correct. They said they took his statement to mean California’s job growth rate was higher than the country’s overall job growth rate. And it is. In 2014, California added jobs at a 3 percent clip compared with the previous year. That was more than a percentage point higher than the country’s overall rate of 1.9 percent during the same period, according to data from Chapman University’s Center for Economic Research. ""Overall, the statement is accurate,"" said Professor Esmael Adibi, the center’s director. ""We are outperforming the U.S."" And that’s not a new trend, said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Point Loma Nazarene University. ""The state has actually outperformed the country as a whole for 44 consecutive months, which amounts to almost four years,"" Reaser said. Still, there’s more to the nation’s job picture. Fourteen other states in 2014 had a higher job growth rate than the country overall, according to data provided by the economists. California’s accomplishment was hardly unique. Another interpretation of De León’s claim is that California’s job growth rate outpaced all other individual states in ""the rest of the nation."" Asked to clarify the senator’s statement, De León’s office pointed to recent news articles that describe California adding more total jobs than any other state, and adding jobs at a faster pace than the nation overall. Still, the phrase ""rest of the nation"" is open to different readings, Abibi said. ""Is he talking about the U.S. as a whole or is he talking about Texas or North Dakota or Michigan?"" the professor asked. That’s significant because five other states had a faster job growth rate than California’s 3 percent last year. They were North Dakota at 3.8 percent; Nevada at 3.5 percent; Colorado at 3.3 percent; Florida at 3.2 percent and Texas with 3.1 percent, according to state and federal data.  Senator Kevin De León addresses members of the U.K. Parliament in London. Photo courtesy De León's office. Our ruling State Senator Kevin de León said earlier this month that California has ""robust job growth that outpaces the rest of the nation, all while reducing carbon emissions and cleaning up the air we breathe."" We limited our fact check to whether California has grown jobs faster than ""the rest of the nation."" We did not evaluate the impact the state’s clean energy policies have had on job growth, a question raised by the second part of De León’s statement.   Economists we spoke with agree that California’s job growth rate has been higher than the nation’s overall average — for several years. Last year, the state’s job growth rate was more than a percentage point higher than the country’s. But a clarification is needed: California is far from the only state that’s added jobs at a faster pace than the national average. Fourteen others accomplished the same feat. And there is another way to read the senator’s statement. One could assume the senator meant California’s job growth rate outpaced all other individual states. Yet, five other states had higher job growth rates in 2014. Those states are part of ""the rest of the nation,"" and would likely balk at the idea of California outpacing their job growth success",Mostly True,"December 7, 2015"
"""You go down to Miami and when it's flooding at high tide on a sunny day, fish are swimming through the middle of the streets.""","As the world watched President Barack Obama’s news conference about climate change, he drew on South Florida to illustrate a point about the impact -- and he zeroed in on fish. ""As the science around climate change is more accepted, as people start realizing that even today you can put a price on the damage that climate change is doing -- you go down to Miami and when it's flooding at high tide on a sunny day, fish are swimming through the middle of the streets, you know, that -- there's a cost to that,"" Obama said at the climate change conference in Paris Dec. 1. That opened the floodgates to a question about whether there are truly fish in the streets. At a town hall event in Iowa, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was among the skeptics: ""Obama said today the streets of Miami are flooded and fish are falling on them. I live there. I don’t know what he’s talking about.’’ So is it a tall tale that fish swim in the streets of Miami? It’s certainly not a regular occurrence. But some people, including a few public officials, say they have seen it. And most importantly, it has been caught on video. The source of Obama’s fish story Spokespersons for the White House sent us news articles from 2014 and 2015 about flooding from king tides in South Florida. (King tides, for those who aren’t familiar with the term, are the highest predicted high tides and happen once or twice a year on the Florida coast. They occur when the orbits and alignment of the Earth, moon, and sun combine to produce the greatest tidal effects of the year.) ""There were fish swimming in the street,"" John Morgan, a Delray Beach city official, told the Sun-Sentinel in October 2014 after a few inches of sea water accumulated without any rain. Morgan told PolitiFact that he has seen fish on Marine Way, a road in a low-lying area, as well as at Veterans Park. ""I have been with the city a couple years now, and I’ve probably seen the fish in the streets at least a half dozen times,"" said Morgan, who now heads up his city’s environmental department. A Hollywood resident, Robin Rorapaugh, told the Miami Herald’s Public Insight Network in October 2015 that king tides had grown in her neighborhood and that ""anyone who doubts climate change should witness the sea come through the storm drains — fish were swimming in the street."" We also found video evidence that supported Obama’s point. A Sept. 28 TV news report featured video showing a fish swimming on Cordova Road in Fort Lauderdale. ""Look at that,"" a bystander said. ""A mullet in the street."" Nancy Gassman, assistant public works director in Fort Lauderdale, told PolitiFact Florida that fish on the streets are a ""regular occurrence"" during high tide flooding in Las Olas Isles and Las Olas Boulevard. ""In past tidal flooding, I personally have seen fish in the streets,"" she said. Obama’s comments echoed a recent statement by former Vice President Al Gore, who told NPR in November: ""I was in Miami last month and fish from the ocean were swimming on some of the streets on a sunny day because it was a high tide. In Miami Beach, Fort Lauderdale, many other places – that happens regularly."" Our efforts to reach Gore were unsuccessful. However, Miami Beach officials told PolitiFact that Gore’s comment stems from a tour during a conference about climate change that happened to coincide with the king tides. Miami Beach officials, including assistant city manager/public works director Eric Carpenter, showed Gore the impact of the tides on the state-owned Indian Creek Drive where the water washes over the sea wall onto the street. ""I absolutely saw the fish,"" Carpenter told PolitiFact. ""You can actually see the fish swimming out of the creek, past the mangrove trees that are there and into the street. I probably saw close to a dozen. They weren’t big fish, but I don’t know, two or three inches long?"" While working on temporary fixes to the road to try to alleviate flooding, Carpenter said he saw the fish on several occasions. ""It was not an isolated incident,"" he said. Flooding has become an expensive problem for places such as Miami Beach, which flood for several days twice a year as a result of king tides. The coastal city is on track to spend around $500 million to install 80 pumps and raise roads and seawalls across the city. The Herald reported that while the city has flooded for decades during king tides, it has been getting worse. ""The king tides have gotten higher in recent years,"" said Colin Polsky, director of the center for environmental studies at Florida Atlantic University, told the Herald. ""And the king tides we're seeing more recently have been higher than they were predicted to be."" It’s important to point out that sightings of fish in the street are not common. Hollywood City Commissioner Patty Asseff, who lives across the street from the intracoastal, said she had never heard of fish in the streets. ""It was the first I had heard about fish in the streets,"" she told PolitiFact after reading Obama’s comments about Miami. ""We have water, we have flooding, but fish I haven’t seen yet."" In the past year, the city of Hollywood has spent more than $1 million on flood gates and pumps in parts of the city to alleviate flooding. For the record, Obama’s statement was technically about Miami -- not Miami Beach. Miami public works director Eduardo Santamaria said he wasn’t aware of fish on the streets in Miami, but he said the city is higher than Miami Beach and parts of Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood. Our ruling Obama said, ""You go down to Miami and when it's flooding at high tide on a sunny day, fish are swimming through the middle of the streets."" This reminds us of the fishing stories you might hear from your uncle.  Fish have been seen (and videotaped) on the streets. But that’s been in the low-lying areas that surround Miami, not on the streets in the city proper. And the sightings were during the more dramatic king tides, when high tides are at their highest, not during average daily high tides",Half True,"December 4, 2015"
"Despite attention on global warming, ""fewer Americans carpool today to work than carpooled in 1980"" and ""SUVs have never been a larger proportion of the vehicles being sold in this country.""","The two-week climate conference now under way in Paris, where President Barack Obama hopes for an international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, has generated attacks from conservatives such as syndicated columnist George Will. On Nov. 30, 2015, the first day of the United Nations gathering, Will made a two-part claim that we want to check. He made the statement on Fox News’ ""Special Report,"" and it was replayed the next day by Milwaukee radio talk show host Charlie Sykes, whose guests are nearly always fellow conservatives. Despite 30 years of ""propaganda"" about global warming, Will stated, ""fewer Americans carpool today to work than carpooled in 1980. SUVs have never been a larger proportion of the vehicles being sold in this country. The American people may profess occasionally to be concerned about global warming, but their behavior tells you that none of this propaganda has had any effect."" The size of the cars Americans drive and how often they carpool are only two ways in which people produce greenhouse gases -- those such as carbon dioxide from vehicles that trap heat in the atmosphere and, scientists believe, contribute to global warming. But let’s see how clean Will’s claim is. Greenhouse gases A little first on greenhouse gases. When Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker stated in September 2015 that the Obama administration’s own Environmental Protection Agency has said its Clean Power Plan ""will have a marginal impact on climate change"" (Half True), we noted that the United States and China are considered the world’s top greenhouse gas polluters. And as PolitiFact National reported the same month, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said it is ""extremely likely"" that humans are causing climate change, and ""very likely"" that greenhouses gases are the driver.   We’ve also noted that according to the EPA, greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles in the United States amount to 27 percent of all sources of greenhouse gases, second only to electric power generation. Now to the first part of Will’s claim. Carpooling The latest census figures show that slightly more than 9 percent of Americans carpooled to work in 2014. As Will suggested, that’s down from nearly 20 percent in 1980, which was the first census to survey about carpooling. Driving alone rose from 64.4 percent to 76.5 percent. Among the reasons, according to experts: The rate of car ownership has risen, work schedules are less predictable, more people work from home and busier Americans want more freedom in managing their commutes with other tasks, such as getting kids to soccer practice. The other part of Will’s statement, however, goes off road a bit. SUVs We’ll note that, strictly speaking, there are traditional sport-utility vehicles, such as the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango, which are built on a truck platform; and the newer crossover-utility vehicles, which are built on a car chassis. They include the Honda CR-V and the Buick Encore. Traditional SUVs peaked with a 17 percent market share in 2002, according to the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based Center for Automotive Research, an independent research group. In 2014, they made up only 7.1 percent of all new vehicle sales. But many people, as well as automotive experts, refer to both types of vehicles simply as SUVs. The car site Edmunds.com told us that SUVs have reached their highest-ever market share in 2015, at 35.5 percent of sales. And the Center for Automotive Research provided us similar figures. In 2014, traditional SUVs and crossovers accounted for 34 percent of new-vehicle sales, as high as any year going back to 1995. Our rating Will said that despite attention on global warming, ""fewer Americans carpool today to work than carpooled in 1980"" and ""SUVs have never been a larger proportion of the vehicles being sold in this country."" Will is correct on carpooling to work and essentially correct on SUVs, when taking into account both traditional SUVs and the smaller crossover vehicles. But it’s worth noting that the market share for the traditional SUVs is down from its peak in 2002",Mostly True,"December 4, 2015"
"Climate change is ""directly related"" to the growth of terrorism.","The Democratic debate in Iowa began with a moment of silence for the victims of the Paris terror attacks before pivoting to a discussion on how to address terrorism. Bernie Sanders, who vowed to ""rid our planet"" of ISIS in his opening statement, also said at a previous debate that the greatest threat to national security is climate change. A day after the terrorist attacks, did he, asked moderator John Dickerson, still believe that? ""Absolutely. In fact, climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism,"" Sanders said on Nov. 14. ""If we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say, you’re gonna see countries all over the world — this is what the CIA says — they’re going to be struggling over limited amounts of water, limited amounts of land to grow their crops, and you’re going to see all kinds of international conflict."" A day later on CBS’ Face the Nation, Sanders doubled down on his statement, elaborating, ""When people migrate into cities and they don't have jobs, there's going to be a lot more instability, a lot more unemployment, and people will be subject to the types of propaganda that al-Qaida and ISIS are using right now."" We were curious about the link between climate change and terrorism that Sanders highlighted. While there is a body of literature backing his broader point that climate change contributes to the growth of terrorism, Sanders is overstating the ""direct"" connection.   A complicated relationship The Sanders camp referred us to statements from President Barack Obama and leaders of the defense community, as well as a Defense Department report that suggests indirect links between climate change and terrorism: • Obama in a May 2015 speech: ""Understand, climate change did not cause the conflicts we see around the world. Yet what we also know is that severe drought helped to create the instability in Nigeria that was exploited by the terrorist group Boko Haram."" • The Defense Department in a 2014 report: ""In our defense strategy, we refer to climate change as a ‘threat multiplier’ because it has the potential to exacerbate many of the challenges we are dealing with today — from infectious disease to terrorism. We are already beginning to see some of these impacts."" • Adm. Samuel J. Locklear, then-commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, said in 2013 that the significant upheaval related to the warming planet ""is probably the most likely thing that is going to happen … that will cripple the security environment."" We found a few other federal and academic reports naming climate change a threat to national security, but that’s not the same thing as ""directly related to the growth of terrorism."" That’s not to say that climate change isn’t contributing to existing problems. Democratic presidential candidate Martin O’Malley used more accurate language when he said, ""One of the things that preceded the failure of the nation-state of Syria and the rise of ISIS was the effect of climate change and the mega-drought that affected that region, wiped out farmers, drove people to cities, created a humanitarian crisis."" We rated his comments Mostly True. Sanders was more sweeping in his comments, though. ""I wouldn’t have said it as strongly, but (climate change) is an accelerant to conflict and helps produce instability,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the national security think tank the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ""Within the national security sphere, more and more see climate change as a real problem. They would agree with the broader point."" Climate change, however, is not ""hermetically sealed from other risks,"" writes Francesco Femia and Caitlin Werrell of the Center for Climate and Security in a blog post. ""The impacts of climate change interact with other factors to make existing security risks worse."" That’s why experts and the Pentagon prefer the term ""threat multiplier."" Here’s how: Climate change can lead to food and water scarcity, which may in turn increase poverty, the spread of disease, and mass migration — in short, instability. In places with already weakened governments, this breeds the conditions for terrorism to thrive. Factors that contribute to terrorism Of course, there are myriad conditions that motivate terrorism. Ideology and political interests are much more direct factors, according to Michael Doran, who served on the National Security Council and in the Defense Department under President George W. Bush. The latest Global Terrorism Index report lists political, nationalist and separatist movements as well as weak political systems and a lack of political legitimacy as main drivers. It found that countries with high levels of terrorism share three ""statistically significant factors"": •  Hostility between different ethnic, religious and linguistic groups; •  State-sponsored violence such as extrajudicial killings, political terrors and high levels of group grievances; •  Violence from organized conflict, demonstrations and crime, and perceptions of criminality. According to the Global Terrorism report, 66 percent of deaths from terrorist attacks in 2013 were caused by four extremist groups: ISIS, Boko Haram, the Taliban and al-Qaida. Their commonality is, obviously, religious extremism. Our ruling Sanders said, ""Climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism."" We couldn’t find any evidence of a ""direct"" relationship between climate change and terrorism, though many reports have noted an indirect link. There are, of course, many other factors that contribute to terrorism, including religious and ethnic tensions and political repression",Mostly False,"November 16, 2015"
"""No city in the state, no state in this nation, for that matter the entire world, has adopted (clean energy) targets more ambitious in scale.""","LISTEN TO THIS STORY:  California is known for setting lofty clean energy goals. But are its targets the most ambitious on the planet? That’s what state Senate leader Kevin de León claimed in a speech in October after Gov. Jerry Brown signed SB 350, a landmark climate change package authored by the senator. The current legislation requires 50 percent of California’s electricity come from renewable energy sources by 2030. That’s up from an earlier mandate calling for 33 percent of the state’s energy to come from renewable sources by 2020. Currently, California gets about a quarter of its energy from renewables, thanks to the huge solar and wind farms that have popped up in places like the Mojave Desert in recent years. The bill by the Los Angeles Democrat also calls on the state to double the energy efficiency of its buildings by 2030. ""Senate Bill 350 puts us on track to generate half, half of our electricity from renewable sources. And double the energy efficiency of all of our buildings by 2030. No city in the state, no state in this nation, for that matter the entire world, has adopted targets more ambitious in scale,"" De León said in a speech at the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles. We decided to fact-check De León’s claim that no one else has more ambitious clean energy targets than California, with a focus on renewable energy.  Our research At first glance, the senator’s statement seemed headed for a ""False"" rating or even ""Pants on Fire!"" That’s because some countries, as well as other U.S. states, and even some cities in California have more aggressive renewable energy goals, at least on a percentage basis. San Francisco’s goal, for example, is to meet 100 percent of its electricity demand with renewable power by 2020 — a decade before California wants to get half of its electricity from renewables. Hawaii’s target is 100 percent renewable energy use by 2045. Vermont’s is 75 percent renewable use by 2032. The percentage threshold is higher for both states but further out than California’s. Internationally, Norway has a goal to produce 67.5 percent of its energy from renewables by 2020, which would be a higher rate and earlier timeframe than California’s goal. But looking at De León’s statement closely, he qualifies it by saying California’s clean energy goals are the most ambitious ""in scale."" His office clarified that the senator was referencing California’s large population size, and its potential to consume and produce more clean energy compared with other states and even some countries. California used 261.5 million megawatt hours of electricity two years ago. That was 27 times the amount used in Hawaii that year, and also far more than Vermont or even Norway. Considering that disparity, some clean energy experts said California does have the most ambitious goals, at least nationally. ""There are many different ways you can try to quantify this, and ways that you can judge how ambitious something is,"" said Brian Lips, who manages a national database on renewable energy for the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center. ""But, I think, in general, this claim was mostly true."" More difficult to answer is the question about whether California’s clean energy goals are the most ambitious globally. Various rankings place China at or near the top for global production of renewable energy, far beyond what California can produce. But that country’s goal of deriving 15 percent of its energy from renewables by 2020 lags behind the Golden State’s target of 33 percent by that year. Comparing California’s clean energy targets and with those of countries is difficult because not all goals are measured the same way, said Laura Wisland, a senior energy analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists and an expert on California renewable energy. Some countries list goals for future clean energy capacity, or the amount of energy they hope to generate after building wind, solar or other renewable energy projects, Wisland said. California’s goal, on the other hand, is tied to the amount of energy it actually uses each year. The enforcement of clean energy standards is a key factor in judging how aggressive they are. Goals set by about a quarter of the states in the U.S. that have renewable energy goals are non-binding recommendations, Wisland added. That’s not the case in California, said Alex Jackson, legal director for the Natural Resources Defense Council’s California Climate Project. NRDC is an environmental advocacy group. ""I think what differentiates California is the degree of specificity and accountability on the main strategies that we are going to be deploying to achieve that target,"" said Jackson, referring to the goals in SB 350. ""We have the goals in place. We also have the roadmap to get there, with the appropriate oversight and enforcement to hold emitters accountable."" In 2012, California became the first state to create a comprehensive cap-and-trade program. It effectively puts a price on carbon emissions by imposing a limit on the amount of carbon dioxide industry can release. The state raises money for clean energy projects each year by auctioning emissions permits. Jackson said that model plus the new goals in SB 350 set California apart. ""If you add up the combined effect of the targets that are in the bill, they easily represent the most ambitious clean energy roadmap anywhere in the world,"" he said. Our ruling Senate leader Kevin de León says ""no city in the state, no state in this nation, for that matter the entire world, has adopted (clean energy) targets more ambitious in scale."" If we define ""ambitious"" as setting high goals and being able to follow through on them, then California clearly has some of the strongest clean energy initiatives in the country and on the planet. That doesn’t mean, however, that it has established the only aggressive targets. Prominent examples include Norway, Hawaii and even San Francisco. In terms of producing clean energy, California won’t be able to compete with global leaders such as China or the United States even if those countries have less aggressive renewable energy targets. Their size makes that impossible. But working in California’s favor, it has an enforcement framework in place. Notably, its cap-and-trade system provides an incentive for industry to invest in renewable energy",Mostly True,"November 3, 2015"
"""Smog was invented in Los Angeles. It was. The name was invented. There was a fellow at Caltech and he came up with the idea and they called it smog.""","LISTEN TO THIS STORY:  Sunshine, Hollywood and freeway gridlock are all inextricably linked to Los Angeles, and so is smog. But was the City of Angels the first to create the noxious, eye-stinging, smudgy haze? Weren’t other industrial cities spewing thick black smoke and creating smog centuries ago? As it turns out, it depends on what you consider ‘smog.’ Gov. Jerry Brown, a warrior in the state’s air pollution battles, offered his California-centric version of smog’s history during a speech in Los Angeles in October. ""Smog was invented in Los Angeles. It was,"" the governor told an audience at Griffith Observatory, with downtown Los Angeles cloaked in a brown haze several miles away, as shown in photos of the event. ""The name was invented. There was a fellow at Caltech and he came up with the idea and they called it smog."" The governor made the claim during a ceremony marking the signing of California’s landmark climate change bill, SB 350. It requires the state to get 50 percent of its electricity from air-friendly, renewable energy sources by 2030. We decided to fact-check Brown’s ""smog was invented in Los Angeles"" statement, to cut through what seemed like a dubious claim. Smog checking First, it’s clear L.A. has no ownership over the term smog. Brown sounds like he was having some fun with the ""invented in Los Angeles"" portion, from listening to him speak. Still, he was literally and blatantly wrong. News articles from as early as 1905 credit London doctor Harold Des Veaux with coining the word smog to describe natural fog contaminated by smoke, according to the Oxford English Dictionary. Great Britain’s affliction with foul air is referenced in Shakespeare’s Macbeth, written in 1606. But its soot-choked skies date as far back as the 12th century, when wood became scarce and residents turned to burning coal to keep warm, according to a history of the country’s air pollution by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It’s clear that other urban centers fought the effects of smog long before anyone imagined the metropolis we call Los Angeles. So, what kind of smoke was the governor blowing? ""Jerry Brown -- brilliant as he is -- is confusing some facts,"" said Chip Jacobs, author of Smogtown: The Lung-Burning History of Pollution in Los Angeles. ""We didn’t invent smog. Smog has been known to arise in many parts of the world well before he was born."" We were headed for a False or Pants On Fire! Then, Jacobs added this comment: ""Brown did have something right in his jumbled pronouncement -- the Caltech professor."" Was there some truth behind the governor’s inartful statement? To get a better picture, we contacted the California Institute of Technology, based in Pasadena. School officials confirmed that Brown was referring to a 1940s-era Caltech professor named Arie Haagen-Smit. Haagen-Smit was the first to prove that automobile exhaust, when exposed to sunlight, creates what’s referred to as photochemical smog, or modern-day smog. It’s the same hazy brown gunk that’s polluted Los Angeles’ air for more than half a century. And it is different from the thick, black coal-driven smoke of London’s industrial era. ""Professor Haagen-Smit did not invent (photochemical) smog, but he discovered the mechanism behind it. This has often been described as inventing smog,"" wrote Professor Richard Flagan, who teaches chemical engineering at Caltech, in an email. Another expert on air quality in Los Angeles said the governor’s claim is less murky than it appears. ""The term smog was used earlier, but it meant something totally different. The definition totally morphed,"" said Sarah Elkind, a history professor at San Diego State University. ""Los Angeles was the first city to deal with photo-chemical smog, which is part of the reason why I would judge Gov. Brown’s statement as mostly correct,"" added Elkind, author of the book How Local Politics Shape Federal Policy: Business, Power, and the Environment in Twentieth Century Los Angeles. A spokesman for the governor said in an email that Haagen-Smit ""was the first one who coined the term for the modern air pollution produced by motor vehicles that we think of today."" He also acknowledged that the term smog had been used to describe other types of pollution long before the 1940s. Our ruling Gov. Jerry Brown said: ""Smog was invented in Los Angeles. It was. The name was invented. There was a fellow at Caltech and he came up with the idea and they called it smog."" A look at historical sources shows the term smog dates back more than a century. It was coined by a London doctor to refer to the smoky black air that fouled Great Britain during its industrial period. Brown’s statement ignores this history, viewing smog’s origin with only a California lens. But looking deeper, a gradual shift in the term’s meaning took place in the 1940s and 1950s as scientists, including Caltech professor Arie Haagen-Smit, studied the cause of Los Angeles’ persistent and foul brown haze. In his statement, the governor references Haagen-Smit, who is credited as the first to prove L.A.’s smog was caused by automobile exhaust, and who at least one current Caltech professor says is ""often described as inventing smog."" The governor’s statement, while fuzzy at first glance, is partially accurate. But it leaves out important details and takes information out of context",Half True,"November 3, 2015"
"""Fifteen out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world"" are in India and China.","Former Sen. Jim Webb, D-Va., spent most of the first Democratic presidential debate in the shadow of frontrunners Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. But he got in a few shots here and there. During the debate, Webb discussed the issue of climate change, arguing that the United States can’t go it alone. ""We are not going to solve climate change simply with the laws here,"" Webb said. ""We've done a good job in this country since 1970. If you look at China and India, they're the greatest polluters in the world. Fifteen out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world are in one of those two countries. We need to solve this in a global way. It's a global problem."" We decided to check whether Webb is right that ""15 out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world"" are in India and China, and whether his point is relevant for the climate change debate. (Webb’s staff did not respond to an inquiry.) The top-20 list There is indeed a credible top-20 list for most-polluted cities. It was assembled by the World Health Organization in 2014. It compares cities based on how much fine particulate matter they have in the air. This measurement is called PM 2.5, standing for particulate matter that is 2.5 microns in width or smaller. (There are about 25,000 microns per inch, so these particles are very small.) Such pollutants at the ground level pose such immediate health risks as eye, nose, throat and lung irritation, and they can elevate the risk for lung and heart ailments over the longer term. These small particles typically come from exhaust from cars, trucks, buses and other vehicles, though they can also come from natural sources such as forest and grass fires. Here’s the list: Rank CIty and country PM 2.5 pollution level 1 Delhi, India 153 2 Patna, India 149 3 Gwalior, India 144 4 Raipur, India 134 5 Karachi, Pakistan 117 6 Peshawar, Pakistan 111 7 Rawalpindi, Pakistan 107 8 Khormabad, Iran 102 9 Ahmedabad, India 100 10 Lucknow, India 96 11 Firozabad, India 96 12 Doha, Qatar 93 13 Kanpur, India 93 14 Amritsar, India 92 15 Ludhiana, India 91 16 Idgir, Turkey 90 17 Narayonganj, Bangladesh 89 18 Allahbad, India 88 19 Agra, India 88 20 Khanna, India 88 So, 13 of the 20 cities on the most-polluted list are located in India (they’re highlighted in bold). That’s two fewer cities than Webb had said, and none of the 20 cities on the list are located in China, as he’d indicated. Still, Webb’s not that far off, and he has a point that the list is dominated by developing countries, including many in south Asia. The relevance of this finding for climate change It’s important to note, however, that particulate pollution is not a key contributor to climate change. Rising global temperatures are more heavily tied to emissions of another substance -- carbon dioxide. Webb’s comment ""does seem to conflate two issues,"" said John Reilly, co-director of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Looking at the U.S. experience over the past few decades can help clarify the difference between the two metrics. ""The U.S. cleaned up emission of particulates and sulfate aerosols by requiring cleaner, lower-sulfur coal and cleaner diesel fuel,"" Reilly said. ""But cleaning up those emissions does nothing directly to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, since we continued to use coal and petroleum products."" Ironically, particulate emissions may actually have a cooling effect rather than a warming effect because they can reflect sunlight back into space, said Brian Soden, a professor in atmospheric sciences at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. This reflectiveness may have made the earth warm more slowly than it might otherwise have. That said, experts agreed that there’s likely a reasonably high correlation between cities that have high particulate counts and those that have high emission levels for carbon dioxide, particularly when you look beyond advanced industrialized nations like the United States. While ""the two lists will not necessarily line up perfectly, the 20 most polluted cities are certainly also top contributors of carbon emissions,"" Soden said. And experts said that Webb does have a point about the need for international cooperation if carbon levels are to be cut. While the United States is a bigger carbon emitter right now, other nations like India are seeing their emissions rise more rapidly. Emissions are only going to fall worldwide if most major emitters reduce their output together. ""Yes, it is absolutely a global problem, but someone needs to lead,"" Soden said. Our ruling Webb said that ""15 out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world"" are in India and China. He’s close -- 13 are in India, though none are in China. It’s worth pointing out, however, that the top-20 list measures cities with the greatest level of particulate pollution, which is not the same thing as emissions of carbon dioxide, the primary driver of climate change",Mostly True,"October 15, 2015"
"Says ""the cascading effects"" of climate change contributed to the rise of ISIS.","""Absurd,"" ""embarrassing,"" and ""brazenly silly"" were some of the insults hurled at Democratic presidential candidate Martin O’Malley when he suggested in July that climate change contributed to the rise of ISIS. Despite the derision, the former governor of Maryland continues to stand by his talking point. ""One of the things that preceded the failure of the nation-state of Syria and the rise of ISIS was the effect of climate change and the mega-drought that affected that region, wiped out farmers, drove people to cities, created a humanitarian crisis,"" O’Malley told Bloomberg TV on July 20. Two months later, O’Malley repeated his argument in an interview with the progressive radio show Democracy Now! on Sept. 10: ""Their government could not take care of the basic needs of families in those conditions. Civil war rose up as a result of protest and repression ... then the vacuum to that led to ISIS. So these are the cascading effects that happen in a world that’s very, very connected and in a world where climate change is now creating extreme weather conditions, prolonged droughts."" With recent events -- the pope’s visit highlighting climate change and the United States’ decision to accept more Syrian refugees -- converging on the topic, we were curious if O’Malley’s claim really was ""absurd."" O’Malley’s source A spokesperson for the O’Malley campaign told us that his source was a March 2015 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study, which was well received in its field, does not mention ISIS at all, but its authors told us O’Malley’s extrapolation makes sense. The study found evidence that climate change led to an extreme drought in Syria’s breadbasket between 2006 to 2009. Food prices skyrocketed, nutrition-related diseases became widespread, and 1.5 million internal refugees abandoned their farms and flooded into Syrian cities already crowded with 1.5 million Iraqi refugees displaced by the Iraq war, according to the study. This influx of people exacerbated existing problems like unemployment, corruption and brewing discontent with the regime of Bashar al-Assad, which failed to respond to the situation, according to the study. In 2011, the unrest reached boiling point and erupted into the Syrian uprising. If we follow the sequence of events like O’Malley does, it’s reasonable to say the next fallen domino is the rise of ISIS. ""Once the war had begun all sorts of pre-existing actors took advantage of the situation to pursue their goals -- ISIS was one and the collapse of Syria provided fertile ground for their actions,"" said co-author Richard Seager, a professor of climatology at Columbia University. O’Malley’s campaign also forwarded us many reports and comments from the Department of Defense linking climate change and ISIS. We should also note that the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences study is not the first rigorous, academic investigation into the links between climate change and conflict (there’s at least one other on the Syrian conflict alone). Drought’s not the sole culprit In the grander scheme of things, experts say, the drought was just one of many sparks that set the Syrian powder keg ablaze. But both the study and O’Malley acknowledge that and get credit for not overstating climate change’s impact. While climate change may have played an indirect role in the Syrian uprising and ISIS’ rise, other causes – Assad’s recruitment of al-Qaeda members, the genocide against Sunni Arabs, etc.– are direct and ""crystal clear,"" according to Ali Khedery, a former special assistant to five American ambassadors in Iraq. Michael Doran, a senior fellow on Middle East security issues at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank, pointed out that unrest in region is not confined to areas suffering from drought. He, however, said that O’Malley’s correct that the drought played a role in generating disaffection.   ""The drought did not cause the Syrian revolution or the fall of Assad,"" said Kenneth Pollack, a senior fellow on Middle East policy at the Brookings Institution. ""A very complex mix of factors did that, but the study suggests that climate change was part of that mix even if we can't tell how important it was."" The study, which Pollack said is garnering a lot of attention among Middle East experts, notes that there is no single cause for conflict, while O’Malley emphasized the ""cascading effects"" of the drought, rather than the drought itself. ""It's fair to say the uprising was going to happen at some point. But the drought did happen when it happened and based on the timing of it, the agricultural collapse and the migration were direct results,"" said study lead author Colin Kelley, a climatologist at the University of California at Santa Barbara. ""The drought creating this chaotic situation also created better opportunity for ISIS to thrive. If you say that in the way (O’Malley) said, it's fair to argue."" Our ruling O’Malley argued that ""the cascading effects"" of climate change contributed to the rise of ISIS The O’Malley campaign referred us to a credible March 2015 study that supports his point. According to the study, a drought in Syria in the 2000s displaced millions of refugees and added to discontent that eventually erupted into war. While the study does not mention ISIS by name, the authors say O’Malley is simply taking their argument one step further. Experts agreed that the drought, spurred by climate change, was one of many factors that led to the Syrian conflict. O’Malley’s phrasing suggests he understands this and is careful not overstate it",Mostly True,"September 23, 2015"
"The Obama administration’s ""own Environmental Protection Agency"" has said its Clean Power Plan ""will have a marginal impact on climate change.""","When the second Republican presidential debate took up climate change, Gov. Scott Walker made a counterintuitive claim about President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which requires the nation’s power plans to reduce their carbon emissions by nearly a third. About midway into the Sept. 16, 2015 debate, held in California, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida was expressing concerns to moderator Jake Tapper about higher utility rates and fewer jobs. That's when Walker interjected and said: ""A lot of those people, though, and I'm going to echo what Senator Rubio just said. This is an issue where, we're talking about my state, it's thousands of manufacturing jobs. Thousands of manufacturing jobs for a rule the Obama administration, (its) own EPA has said will have a marginal impact on climate change."" Walker’s campaign confirmed to us that the governor was referring to the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan, and to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. There are differences of opinion, of course, over how much one plan in one country can affect the global climate. But to Walker’s claim: Did the EPA -- the agency administering the Clean Power Plan -- say the plan’s regulations would have only a marginal effect on climate change? The plan In August 2015, the Obama administration announced that its Clean Power Plan regulations would require power plants to reduce carbon emissions, from 2005 levels, by 32 percent by 2030. (A 2014 draft of the plan had sought a 30 percent reduction.) Advocates said the reduction would help attack global warming and provide reductions in other emissions that create soot and smog. But the announcement prompted Walker to add Wisconsin to states that are challenging the first-ever requirements in court. The reductions won't be uniform, because individual states rely on different mixes of coal, natural gas, nuclear energy, water, wind and the sun to provide power. Wisconsin, which has traditionally relied heavily on coal, faces having to reduce emissions 34 percent-- the sixth-highest rate in the country, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. EPA’s view As for the the EPA, it has described the Clean Power Plan as a necessary, though not sufficient, step in addressing climate change -- and as part of a larger strategy to spur other nations to reduce emissions. During a July 2015 congressional hearing, U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, challenged EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy on the impact on climate change. The Texas Republican quoted a former EPA assistant secretary under Obama as saying the plan would, at most, reduce the global temperature by 1/100 of a degree Celsius. McCarthy responded by saying that the value of the plan can’t be measured that way. She said that while the plan mandates carbon emission reductions in the United States, it also aims to prod other nations to reduce their emissions and to trigger investment in technological innovations that also will reduce emissions. The value of the plan is ""in showing strong domestic action, which can actually trigger global action,"" McCarthy said. ""(I’m) not disagreeing that this action in and of itself will not make all the difference we need to address climate action. But what I'm saying is if don't take action domestically, we will never get started."" (Separately, EPA spokeswoman Liz Purchia told us the agency has said the Clean Power Plan ""is only one component of our larger strategy,"" which includes measures for vehicle fuel efficiency and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.) During the same hearing, there were fears expressed that the plan will drive up the cost of electricity to consumers. And U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., expressed concern that China, India and Russia would not reduce the growth in their carbon emissions. So, the head of the EPA acknowledges that the Clean Power Plan -- since it applies only to the United States -- can have only a limited impact on global climate change. But besides reducing carbon emissions in the United States, the plan is aimed at getting other nations to do the same. Other views We interviewed two experts about the Clean Power Plan and the EPA’s take on it: Adele Morris of the Brookings Institution’s Climate and Energy Economics Project, and Chip Knappenberger of the Cato Institute’s Center for the Study of Science. Both agreed that the United States historically is a major emitter of carbons, but growing nations such as India and China will play a larger role in future emissions. And they agreed that a key part of the EPA’s strategy with the Clean Power Plan is that as a global leader, if the United States reduces emissions, other nations might be spurred to do so, as well. Other experts have made the same point. ""This appears to be an intentionally obfuscating perspective,"" Dallas Burtraw, a senior fellow at Resources for the Future a think tank that tracks energy policy, said of Walker's claim. ""Climate change is a global problem. The contribution of U.S. efforts are greater, in my mind, for the influence they have on the behavior of the other nations of the world than for the specific reductions that the U.S. achieves. The greater contribution is leadership in this case."" In June 2015 -- five months before a United Nations summit meeting aimed at forging a global accord to cut climate-warming emissions -- China submitted a plan to the U.N. detailing how it plans to reduce fossil fuel emissions by 2030. The New York Times reported that climate policy experts cited the significance of China’s plan, given that the United States and China -- the world’s top greenhouse gas polluters -- have long been viewed as the biggest obstacles to reaching a meaningful global warming deal. Our rating In the debate, Walker said the Obama administration’s ""own Environmental Protection Agency"" has said its Clean Power Plan ""will have a marginal impact on climate change."" The EPA acknowledges that the plan can have only a limited effect on global climate change, given that they order reductions in carbon emission only in the United States. But a key aim of the plan is to spur other nations to reduce their emissions, as well, and to spur new technologies that will help reduce emissions",Half True,"September 21, 2015"
"The claim that 97 percent of scientists believe humans are causing climate change has been debunked by the ""head"" of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. ""That number was pulled out of thin air.""","Appearing on HBO’s Real Time with Bill Maher, GOP presidential hopeful Rick Santorum doubled down on his skepticism of man-made climate change. Santorum made two claims to back his point. First, in a large survey of climate scientists, ""57 percent don’t agree with the idea that 95 percent of the change in the climate is caused by CO2,"" according to Santorum. (We found that claim False.) Second, Santorum said that a widely cited figure of scientific consensus on climate change — 97 percent — has been debunked by the ""head"" of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, he said. ""The 97 percent figure that’s thrown around, the head of the UN IPC (sic) said that number was pulled out of thin air. It was based on a survey of 77 scientists,"" he said on Aug. 28. ""Not even 97 scientists responded to that survey."" Several readers asked us to look into Santorum’s claim. His campaign didn’t get back to us, but we found that Santorum misstated both who objected to the figure and what that person objected to. From 2002 until recently, the chairman of the IPCC was climate scientist Rajendra Pachauri, who resigned from his post in February 2015. To our knowledge, neither Pachauri nor current chairman Ismail El Gizouli has criticized the 97 percent figure. Pachauri has, in fact, endorsed the notion of scientific consensus on climate change. ""By overwhelming consensus, the scientific community agrees that climate change is real,"" he said at a press conference in 2010. Santorum is likely referring to Richard Tol, an economist at the University of Sussex who’s been a vocal critic of the 97 percent figure. He is not, as Santorum claims, the ""head"" of the IPCC, though he was the convening lead author of a chapter of the IPCC’s fifth report. He has since parted ways with the IPCC. Currently, Tol serves as an adviser to the Global Warming Policy Foundation. That group, says Stephan Lewandowsky, a psychologist at the University of Bristol who studies the rejection of climate science, is ""the U.K.’s most prominent source of climate change denial."" The ""thin air"" quote Santorum cited is from Tol’s testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. ""I mean it is pretty clear that most of the science agrees that climate change is real and most likely human-made,"" Tol said on during a 2014 hearing on the IPCC. ""But the 97 percent is essentially pulled from thin air. It is not based on any credible research whatsoever."" Tol was specifically referring to a 2013 survey by John Cook, who studies climate communication at the University of Queensland. Cook’s study found that among over 4,000 studies that took a position on man-made climate change, 97.1 percent ""endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global phase"" and 97.2 of 1,300 authors who responded agreed with the position. Tol takes issue with Cook’s methodology. By his analysis of Cook’s data, the real figure is around 91 percent. (Cook replied critiquing Tol’s methodology and standing by his survey’s original finding of 97 percent.) ""There is no doubt in my mind that the literature on climate change overwhelmingly supports the hypothesis that climate change is caused by humans,"" Tol writes in his analysis. ""I have very little reason to doubt that the consensus is indeed correct. Cook et al., however, failed to demonstrate this."" So Santorum is talking about the wrong person. And his reference to ""a survey of 77 scientists,"" is talking about something else entirely. The study Santorum is attempting to describe is a 2009 survey by Peter Doran, a professor of earth science at Louisiana State University. About 90 percent of around 3,000 surveyed earth scientists said they think climate change is happening, and about 82 percent said human activity is contributing to it. The 97 percent figure comes from a subsample of climate scientists in Doran’s study, and Santorum correctly describes its small size: 74 out of 77 respondents said they agreed that climate change is man-made. Beyond his and Cook’s study, a 2010 study of over 1,300 climate researchers and their work also showed a 97 to 98 percent consensus. ""They keep talking about how ‘the’ 97 percent study is wrong,"" Doran told PolitiFact in an interview. ""Well it turns out, we never know which study they are referring to because there have been three peer-reviewed studies of late that have arrived at this 97 percent number in different ways and by different people."" Our ruling Santorum said, ""The 97 percent figure that’s thrown around, the head of the UN IPC (sic) said that number was pulled out of thin air. It was based on a survey of 77 scientists."" Santorum’s claim confuses several points. First, the critic of the 97 percent he’s referring to isn’t the ""head"" of the UN’s climate panel, but an economist who has collaborated with but has since left the IPCC. Second, the 97 percent doesn’t come from one specific survey — it appears in at least three. And finally, the study Santorum describes isn’t the one the economist objects to. Moreover, Tol himself doesn’t refute the notion of broad scientific consensus on man-made climate change. Santorum’s claim is inaccurate",False,"September 2, 2015"
"""The most recent survey of climate scientists said about 57 percent don’t agree with the idea that 95 percent of the change in the climate is caused by CO2.""","Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum sparred with liberal talk show host Bill Maher on a topic near and dear to both men’s hearts for different reasons: climate change. Maher kicked off the debate by naming climate change as one of his main concerns for the 2016 election and challenged Santorum’s skepticism. Santorum, who has repeatedly called climate change ""a hoax,"" shot back by arguing that there really isn’t scientific consensus. ""I’m not alone,"" Santorum said on Maher’s Aug. 28 HBO show. ""The most recent survey of climate scientists said about 57 percent don’t agree with the idea that 95 percent of the change in the climate is caused by CO2."" Santorum, pressed by an incredulous Maher, repeated the claim: ""There was a survey done of 1,800 scientists, and 57 percent said they don’t buy off on the idea that CO2 is the knob that’s turning the climate. There’s hundreds of reasons the climate’s changed."" ""Rick, I don’t know what ass you’re pulling that out of,"" Maher retorted. ""I’m not! I’ll send you the survey,"" Santorum promised. Several readers wrote to us asking about Santorum’s numbers, so we asked his campaign to send us the survey as well. They didn’t get back to us, but we did find the figure.   In short, Santorum’s claim commits ""two orders of mischaracterization,"" said Anthony Leiserowitz, who studies climate change public opinion at Yale University. He not only uses a flawed statistic, but also misstates what it’s allegedly disapproving. Santorum’s sloppy reading To begin with, Santorum inaccurately describes the ""idea"" that he says 57 percent of scientists ""don’t agree with."" What he’s referring to is a finding by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its fifth report. The IPCC has said it is ""extremely likely"" (meaning a 95 percent confidence level) that humans are causing climate change. The IPCC also said it is ""very likely"" (meaning a 90 percent confidence level) that greenhouses gases are the driver. Santorum restated IPCC points wrong. They never said 95 percent of the change in the climate is caused by CO2. In fact, no one has ever made that statement, according to Leiserowitz. ""There are several other greenhouse gases, including methane, nitrous oxide, and water vapor, as a amplifier. CO2 is the most important of these and others, but no one to my knowledge has ever claimed that CO2 caused 95 percent of the warming,"" he said. The closest IPCC comes to what Santorum claimed is saying that there’s a 90 percent chance that greenhouse gases are driving climate. That’s a far cry from what Santorum actually said. Even still, the 57 percent figure doesn’t hold up. Fuzzy math The figure likely comes from the blog Fabius Maximus (and repeated by the prominent climate change skeptic Joanne Nova), which re-analyzed the findings of a 2014 survey by the Dutch environmental research agency PBL. According to Fabius Maximus editor Larry Kummer, the survey’s findings disprove the IPCC's confidence level finding. He walked us through how he got the 57 percent: 1. About 65.9 percent of scientists said they agreed that greenhouse gases were the main driver of climate change. 2. Of those scientists, 65.2 percent reported ""virtually certain"" or it was ""extremely likely"" that their estimate was correct (corresponding to a 95 percent or higher confidence level). 3. That means, according to Kummer, about 43 percent (65.2 percent of 65.9 percent) were extremely confident that greenhouse gases were the main driver of climate change. In other words, 57 percent weren’t 95 percent confident. We ran Kummer’s analysis by a few experts, including the survey authors themselves, who said his interpretation is flat-out wrong. The survey’s lead author, Bart Verheggen, told us that Kummer — and, by extension, Santorum — made a few mistakes. First, 22 percent of climate scientists surveyed didn’t directly answer a question as to what extent greenhouse gases were causing climate change, says Verheggen. Verheggen said it would be more accurate to consider only those who answered the question. (He goes into more detail in a blog post.) Second, Kummer only counts scientists who were 95 percent or more confident that greenhouse gases drive climate change, when the actual IPCC statement reports a 90 percent certainty, Verheggen pointed out. ""Basically, Santorum’s claim is not consistent with the results from our survey,"" Verheggen concluded. ""This is like something out of that book, How to Lie With Statistics,"" said Stephen Farnsworth, who studies climate change and political communication at the University of Mary Washington. ""What we’re talking about here is extraordinary cherry-picking. You’re only counting one question in one survey, and you’re talking about a very high (confidence level). Once you start stacking up numbers like this, you’re really distorting the real finding of this research."" What the survey (and others) actually say The real finding of the survey actually backs the idea of scientific consensus on climate change, despite varying levels of confidence, said Verheggen. ""It is clear from our survey that a strong majority of scientists agree that greenhouse gases originating from human activity are the dominant cause of recent warming,"" he said. That’s consistent with most of the literature on scientific opinion about climate change, experts agreed. ""You don't get anywhere near 57 percent when surveying the broad earth science community, and you get very close to full consensus when you ask the experts in climate science,"" said Peter Doran, a professor of earth science at Louisiana State University. National Science Board member James Powell surveyed what’s actually published in scientific journals, finding that the consensus in the literature is about 99.9 percent. And multiple independent studies have ""asked scientists directly"" and found consensus levels of around 97 percent, said William Anderegg, who studies climate change at Princeton University.   ""Those studies were rigorously peer-reviewed and thus should be considered more credible than a blog post that misreads an institute report,"" he said. Our ruling Santorum said, ""The most recent survey of climate scientists said about 57 percent don’t agree with the idea that 95 percent of the change in the climate is caused by CO2."" He’s not pulling the numbers out of thin air, as Maher suggests more bluntly, but the claim is inaccurate and misleading. Essentially, Santorum garbles a blog’s textbook misinterpretation of a survey. In reality, the survey actually supports the idea of scientific consensus on climate change, the lead author told us",False,"September 1, 2015"
"The Obama administration is ""proposing to mine another 10 billion tons of Wyoming coal, which would unleash three times more carbon pollution than Obama's Clean Power Plan would even save through 2030.""","President Barack Obama is playing an environmental joke on us, according to a video by progressive activist group Credo Action. This week, Obama traveled to Alaska to promote his climate change agenda. But some environmental activists see the visit as hypocritical, considering some of his other policy decisions, such as permitting oil drilling in the Arctic. To highlight what it sees as contradictory policies, Credo Action released an annotated version of a White House video promoting the Alaska trip. Credo’s video says Obama’s trip is antithetical to some of his own policies, including ""proposing to mine another 10 billion tons of Wyoming coal, which would unleash three times more carbon pollution than Obama's Clean Power Plan would even save through 2030."" Credo is right that mining 10 billion tons of coal in quick order would more than negate any carbon reductions from Obama’s EPA plan. There’s just one problem: There’s no proposal to mine 10 billion tons of coal. What proposal? Credo’s source is a 2015 report by Greenpeace, another progressive environmental activist group. The report references the federal coal lease program, by which the government leases public lands to private companies for coal mining. The report said that a field office of the Bureau of Land Management in Buffalo, Wy., is proposing several new leases that would amount to 10.2 billion tons of coal. Greenpeace estimated that burning all 10.2 billion tons would result in almost 17 billion tons of carbon pollution. That dwarfs what the Environmental Protection Agency says Obama's Clean Power Plan will cut in carbon emissions. According to the EPA, the Clean Power Plan will reduce carbon emissions in the power sector by about 870 million tons annually by 2030. Greenpeace used a National Resources Defense Council estimate of the cumulative emission reductions through 2030 -- 5.3 billion tons. Greenpeace’s carbon pollution calculation is reasonable, said Michael Mann, executive director of the Institute for Energy Studies at the University of North Dakota. Roughly 2.4 pounds of carbon are produced per pound of subbituminous coal (found in Wyoming) burned. The problem is that this 10.2 billion new tons of coal proposal is nonexistent. Greenpeace -- and others who have quoted this figure -- are distorting a single line buried in a 3,000-page report. In May 2015, the Wyoming field office released a resource management plan, which says the bureau ""has estimated that it would issue 28 coal leases encompassing 106,400 acres with approximately 10.2 billion tons of coal...over the next 20 years."" But this is not a proposal or prediction. This is an outer-bounds estimate generated solely for the purposes of analysis, bureau spokeswoman Kristen Lenhardt told PolitiFact. The figures refer to the maximum amount of development possible within the 20-year lifespan of the resource management plan. The many regulatory steps that happen before land is offered for a coal lease, as well as shifts in market demand, would affect the actual amount of land available. ""It was not a plan for how much coal may, or may not be, leased in future years,"" she said. ""It is highly unlikely that actual development during the period of the plan will be anywhere close to this number of leases or acres."" Also noteworthy is the fact that the resource management plan did not designate any new lands for coal lease consideration. These 106,400 acres identified by the report were already categorized as lands that could be available for mining. Even if this were a real proposal, Credo’s timeline is unrealistic. It assumes that all 10 billion tons of Wyoming coal would be burned by 2030, which would require a staggering increase in coal use. The country has consumed around 1 billion tons of coal annually in recent years, and that’s including coal produced all over the country, not just Wyoming. There are not nearly enough power plants in the country for this to work, Mann said. The United States has fewer than 520 coal-fired plants, and that number is on the decline. ""If we replaced all of the coal that is currently burned with this new coal from Wyoming, we still would not use that much coal,"" Mann said. Our ruling A video by Credo Action said the Obama administration is ""proposing to mine another 10 billion tons of Wyoming coal, which would unleash three times more carbon pollution than Obama's Clean Power Plan would even save through 2030."" Burning 10 billion tons of coal over the next 15 years would unleash more carbon pollution than the federal clean energy regulations expect to save in the same period of time. However, burning that much coal in that timeframe is unrealistic, and, more importantly, the government has not made such a proposal. Rather, the 10 billion tons figure refers to an estimate -- developed solely for analysis -- of the maximum amount of coal that could be available for mining in a particular region of Wyoming over the next 20 years",Mostly False,"September 1, 2015"
"""Obama’s Clean Power Plan ... eliminates coal-fired power plants.""","A federal plan to drive down carbon emissions wipes out coal-fired power plants, an Austin analyst wrote. In a June 2015 opinion column published in the Austin American-Statesman, Robert Henneke of the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation took issue with the Clean Power Plan released in 2014 by President Barack Obama’s administration. Henneke, director of the foundation’s Center for the American Future, wrote: ""Coal, the target of Obama’s Clean Power Plan, generates 34 percent of Texas’s electricity. The plan eliminates coal-fired power plants and requires Texas to assume reductions in excess of 27 other states combined."" It doesn’t surprise us that the nation’s second-largest state would be saddled with more reductions than a slew of other states. For this fact check, we focused on whether the Obama plan eliminates coal-fired plants — a claim the Texas office of the Environmental Defense Fund brought to our attention, calling it inaccurate. To our inquiry, a foundation spokeswoman, Caroline Espinosa, conceded by email that under the Environmental Protection Agency plan, all ""coal-fired plants are not eliminated, though,"" she said, ""a great number of them will be: enough to cause grievous harm to the Texas economy and Texas families."" Let’s summarize the plan, which is to be finalized this year, then explore its impact on coal-fired electricity plants. Clean Power Plan The Clean Power Plan is premised on the states by 2030 collectively driving down carbon emissions from power plants by 30 percent from 2005 levels — in part, the agency has said, through regional ""cap and trade"" networks, investments in renewable energy and smart grid technology — plus phase-outs of many existing coal-fueled plants. ""Power plants,"" the EPA says in a fact sheet last updated in June 2015, ""are the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States, making up roughly one-third of all domestic greenhouse gas emissions."" A 2014 fact check But PolitiFact concluded previously that the plan doesn’t outlaw coal as fuel or require coal-fired plants to close. In August 2014, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., rated False a claim by U.S. Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., that the administration plan meant coal would not be permitted as an electricity fuel, even in limited amounts. In 2014, Michael Webber, deputy director of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin, said: ""In no way does this program say coal can’t live. What it is is a death blow for outdated, old, vintage coal plants, unless they pay for"" technology upgrades. Amy Jaffe, executive director of Energy and Sustainability at the University of California, Davis, said at the time that states would influence the process as each one creates its blueprint for decreasing emissions. ""It may be in some places there is nothing you can do other than stop using coal, but there's nothing in the rules that says there can’t be coal,"" Jaffe said. EPA: Plan doesn't mandate retirement of coal-fired plants To our inquiry, a Washington-based EPA spokeswoman, Enesta Jones, said by email ""EPA’s proposal provides each state with enormous flexibility to design plans that meet their individual and unique needs, and does not mandate the retirement of any coal plants."" Nationally, though, coal is expected to recede as a fuel. The EPA’s initial estimates assumed 30 percent of the country’s energy would come from coal in 2030, down from 39 percent in 2013. According to the agency, the plan gives each state a different threshold for reducing carbon emissions it must reach based on feasibility, cost and current pollution levels, among factors. And, the agency says, it’s up to each state to decide how to comply. Federal rules against mercury emissions, which experts have described as more stringent than the pending power plan, also could factor into coal fading. Foundation cites national and Texas studies Espinosa, elaborating on Henneke’s claim, told us there are reasons to expect Texas plants to close due to the plan. By email, she pointed out a May 2015 analysis of the plan undertaken by the U.S. Energy Information Administration at the request of U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. Nationally under the plan, the report says, projected coal plant ""retirements,"" meaning closings, would total 90 gigawatts in power generation, most of that occurring by 2020. That prediction compares with an expected retirement of 40 gigawatts in coal-fueled power if the plan doesn’t take effect, the report says. New plants, the report says,would largely be fueled by natural gas and renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. Texas stands to see coal-fired generation decline by 100 billion kilowatthours by 2025 — alongside spurts in natural gas and renewable energy — with a slight coal rebound occurring by 2040, the report says. In the illustration below, the ""Base Policy"" case refers to EIA’s modeling of the Clean Power Plan and the ""AEO2015 Reference Case"" reflects its projections of energy supply, demand and prices based on federal, state and local laws in place as of October 2014 — in other words, without the EPA plan in effect:  Espinosa, in her email, said the ""remarkable extent of de facto coal-fire plant elimination in Texas"" is backed up by the the Balanced Energy for Texas Coalition--which represents consumers and coal producers, transporters and industrial users, spokesman Russ Keene told us. By email, Keene said the EPA’s own Integrated Planning Model indicates 24 of the 41-coal fired power plants in Texas would close from 2020 to 2025 under the administration plan even though none are currently scheduled to retire for other reasons. The EPA in 2013 described the planning model as a ""multi-regional, dynamic, deterministic linear programming model of the U.S. electric power sector. It provides forecasts of least cost capacity expansion, electricity dispatch, and emission control strategies while meeting energy demand and environmental, transmission, dispatch, and reliability constraints. IPM can be used to evaluate the cost and emissions impacts of proposed policies to limit emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon dioxide (CO2), mercury (Hg), and"" hydrochloric acid ""from the electric power sector."" Espinosa forwarded an email from Austin attorney Michael J. Nasi, who represents the coalition, stating the calculations behind the projection were rooted in EPA data. Separately, Terry Hadley, spokesman for the Public Utility Commission of Texas, pointed out an August 2014 filing with the commission from Nasi on behalf of the Partnership for a Better Energy Future, which the filing describes as drawing together more than 150 trade groups including the American Petroleum Institute, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Texas Association of Business and the American Farm Bureau Federation. The filing says EPA’s assumptions about plants switching from coal to natural gas to reduce carbon emissions indicate Texas would experience a decrease of 72 million megawatt hours from coal-fired plants, most of that by 2020. Other analyses We asked others including the EPA  to assess the plan’s effect on coal-fired plants. By phone and email, Ilan Levin, an Austin-based lawyer for the Environmental Integrity Project, which focuses on strict enforcement of anti-pollution laws, questioned the coalition’s conclusion that the plan would result in 24 Texas coal-fired plants shutting down. While the EPA predicts a drop in coal-fired electricity by 2030, he said, and an EPA scenario involves Texas fulfilling its CO2-reduction goals by moving from coal to natural gas power generation and improved efficiency, Levin said, the federal plan ""simply sets goals and leaves it to the states on how to get there. It's premature to say the CPP eliminates coal plants,"" he said. That said, Levin added, there ""are certainly very realistic scenarios with retirements of many Texas coal plants in the next 15 years or so. But these are driven mainly by economics. Regulatory drivers, specifically EPA rules that will involve more costs to power plants, include a long list of anti- smog and mercury rules and clean water and waste rules that have been in development for years if not decades. So, CPP is an important rule,"" he said, ""but it has not yet been implemented by the states, so all the details in terms of how it will get implemented have yet to be written."" By phone, Adele Morris, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Brookings Institution, said coal has been supplanted by other fuel sources already for a variety of reasons, some of them regulatory, others having to do with natural gas being cheaper and new plants being cheaper to build than it costs to fix up old ones. Jones, the EPA spokeswoman, called the coalition’s calculation a ""reasonable interpretation of the Integrated Planning Model (IPM) data for the proposed Clean Power Plan.  Our own review was slightly different, showing 23 additional retirements in 2025,"" she said. ""Actual compliance may differ from the illustrative approaches that EPA lays out,"" she said, again noting each state is to determine how to meet its carbon reduction goals. In Texas, Robbie Searcy, a staff spokeswoman for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages the flow of electricity to most Texans, responded to our inquiry by pointing us to a November 2014 report in which ERCOT estimated the proposed CO2 emission limits would result in the retirement of 3,300 to 8,700 megawatts of coal generation capacity in Texas. Yet Searcy also emailed us an agency summary of a December 2014 ERCOT report indicating multiple federal pollution regulations might explain plant closings. The summary said: ""Coal-fired power plants are the most affected by environmental regulations, which include the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, the Regional Haze program, the 316(b) Cooling Water Intake Structures Rule, the Electric Effluent Limitation Guidelines Rule, the Coal Combustion Residuals Disposal Rule, and the proposed Clean Power Plan released earlier this year. ""ERCOT assessed the impacts of these regulations through a generator survey and a modeling analysis. Results indicate that the Regional Haze Program and Clean Power Plan, in combination with other regulations, could result in the retirement of up to 8,700 megawatts (MW) of coal-fired generation resources in the ERCOT region. That is about half the coal-fired capacity and more than 13 percent of the overall thermal generation resources, by MW, that serve ERCOT today."" By telephone, John Hall of the Environmental Defense Fund, Texas, said he read the December 2014 ERCOT report to mean the Clean Power Plan could by itself account for 200 megawatt hours in additional coal-fueled power plant reductions in Texas--which he said amounts to one third to one half of a plant. We asked ERCOT if it expects coal-fired plant closings due to many federal pollution regulations, with the pending power plan perhaps playing a minimal role? By email, Searcy said: ""Yes, ERCOT anticipates that some coal-fired plants will retire as a result of changes to environmental regulations. It is too early to tell what… role (minimal or otherwise) CPP specifically will play."" Our ruling Henneke said ""Obama’s Clean Power Plan ... eliminates coal-fired power plants."" That’s off the mark in that the plan, yet to be finalized, doesn’t wipe out any coal-fired plants. It looks to us like decisions to close plants (or individual units) will depend on how Texas decides to address its assigned carbon-reduction goals. Meantime, pollution limits already in place might hasten shutdowns--with or without the Clean Power Plan taking effect",Mostly False,"July 24, 2015"
"Says Barack Obama told the U.S. Coast Guard Academy ""that the number one threat to the military and the world today is global warming.""","As he pursues a bid for the White House in 2016, Gov. Scott Walker has made it a point to call for more action against ""radical Islamic terrorism."" He did so again while speaking June 20, 2015, in Washington, D.C., at a conference of the Faith & Freedom Coalition, a group led by conservative political strategist Ralph Reed. Toward the end of his remarks, Walker turned to national security -- or what he prefers to call ""safety."" He criticized President Barack Obama and Obama’s former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner for president. And then he made a claim about Obama, national security and global warming. ""You know, I think about how mixed up this Obama-Clinton doctrine is when it comes to foreign policy,"" Walker said. ""We've got a president who, earlier this year -- at the graduation ceremony for the Coast Guard Academy -- stood up and actually told the graduates that the number one threat to the military and the world today is global warming. ""Well, I've got a message for you, Mr. President: The number one threat to the military, the number one threat to America, the number one threat to the world, is radical Islamic terrorism and it's about time we do something about it."" Extended applause followed. But Walker made a far-reaching claim. Did Obama tell graduates from a branch of the military that global warming is the number one threat to the military and the world? What was said Walker’s claim pertains to the commencement speech the president gave May 20, 2015, at the academy, which is located in New London, Conn. The official text shows Obama devoted the bulk of his speech to climate change (he used that term, not global warming), describing it as a serious threat to America’s national security and to global security. He did not go so far as to call it the top threat to the military or the world. Here’s a key portion of what Obama said: And this brings me to the challenge I want to focus on today -- one where our Coast Guardsmen are already on the front lines, and that, perhaps more than any other, will shape your entire careers -- and that’s the urgent need to combat and adapt to climate change. As a nation, we face many challenges, including the grave threat of terrorism. And as Americans, we will always do everything in our power to protect our country. Yet even as we meet threats like terrorism, we cannot, and we must not, ignore a peril that can affect generations …. Here at the Academy, climate change -- understanding the science and the consequences -- is part of the curriculum, and rightly so, because it will affect everything that you do in your careers ….As America’s Maritime Guardian, you’ve pledged to remain always ready -- Semper Paratus -- ready for all threats.  And climate change is one of those most severe threats. And this is not just a problem for countries on the coasts, or for certain regions of the world. Climate change will impact every country on the planet. No nation is immune.  So I’m here today to say that climate change constitutes a serious threat to global security, an immediate risk to our national security. And make no mistake, it will impact how our military defends our country. And so we need to act -- and we need to act now. So, Walker suggests Obama puts climate change ahead of terrorism as a threat, but in his speech, the president notes that the U.S. needs to confront both. We also checked five news accounts of the speech -- from the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the Associated Press, TIME and Fox News. They all emphasized that Obama described climate change as a threat or serious threat to national security. Other speeches Prior to the Coast Guard speech, Obama -- in a general context -- suggested climate change is the world’s number one threat. For instance, in his State of the Union speech in January 2015, Obama said: ""No challenge  poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change."" And in April 2015, a few days before Earth Day, he said: ""Today, there's no greater threat to our planet than climate change."" So, after having identified climate change as perhaps the world’s greatest threat overall, Obama did devote a speech, given to members of the military, to the threat climate change poses to national and global security. But he didn’t go as far as Walker claims. Our rating Walker said Obama told the Coast Guard Academy ""that the number one threat to the military and the world today is global warming."" Obama on various occasions, and in a general context, has said there is no greater threat to the world than climate change. But in the speech Walker cited, the president told Coast Guard graduates that climate change was a serious threat, not the number one threat to the military or the world",Mostly False,"June 25, 2015"
"""This March, for the first time in human history, the monthly average carbon dioxide in our atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million. The range had been 170-300 parts per million for hundreds of thousands of years.""","Sheldon Whitehouse gave his 100th speech on climate change on the floor of the U.S. Senate on May 18, 2015. Over the past three years, the senator has served up several climate claims worth checking during his running series ""Time to wake up."" So we examined his 100th installment and noticed this statement: ""This March, for the first time in human history, the monthly average carbon dioxide in our atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million. The range had been 170-300 parts per million for hundreds of thousands of years."" Scientists, who see climate change as Whitehouse does, say the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2)  in the earth’s atmosphere is increasing due, in large part, to the burning of fossil fuels. And they say rising CO2 levels are an indicator that humans are degrading the health of the planet. We went looking for evidence and quickly found a report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  that seemed right on target. On May 6, NOAA announced that the monthly global average of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had exceeded 400 parts per million — for the first time since it had been compiling the data in 1979. This seemed to leave only the ""human history"" part of Whitehouse’s claim in question. But when Whitehouse addressed the issue May 18, he did not specify his source. And, confusingly, he spoke of a ""monthly average"" not a ""monthly global average,"" the term used by NOAA. The distinction is relevant: While the NOAA monthly global average had never exceeded 400 over a period of more than 35 years, the agency’s scientists had previously measured monthly average carbon dioxide levels exceeding 400 ppm in several single locations. In 2012, for example, the ""monthly average"" at the NOAA observatory in Barrow, Alaska, exceeded 400 ppm for the first time. Then the agency’s observatory in Mauna Loa, Hawaii, reported that its ""monthly average"" CO2 level had exceeded 400 parts per million in April 2014. These earlier records, which were reported extensively, were based on observations from single locations while the NOAA monthly global average is based on data from 40 different sites. So Whitehouse seems to have been off a bit with his description of the monthly CO2 data. But what about human history? The senator’s spokesman, Seth Larson, referred us to ice-core data from Antarctica.   Scientists take core samples in Greenland and Antarctica and study the CO2 level of air bubbles — some of which have been trapped in the ice for hundreds of thousands of years. Data from Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, which serves as the primary climate-change data hub of the U.S Department of Energy, show carbon dioxide concentrations ranging between 170 and 300 parts per million ""over the last 800,000 years."" That  more than covers Whitehouse’s in-human-history claim as humans have only been around for about 200,000, according to the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. Before we closed the book on this one, we contacted Anthony Watts, an often-quoted global-warming skeptic. Watts claimed Whitehouse was wrong and cited the individual monthly data and a 2005 article in Nature that he said challenged the senator’s statement. We tracked down the lead author of the Nature, Swedish scientist Anders Moberg, and asked him about the Watts challenge. Impossible, Moberg  said, explaining that his study was about temperatures in 1100 AD to 1150 AD — not carbon dioxide. For CO2 data, Moberg and John King, an oceanography professor at URI, pointed us to the ice-core research, the same data cited by Whitehouse’s office. The ice core records ""would support the Senator's statement,"" said King. ""The highest natural levels are around 300 ppm."" Our ruling In his 100th speech on global warming on May 18, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said: ""This March, for the first time in human history, the monthly average carbon dioxide in our atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million. The range had been 170-300 parts per million for hundreds of thousands of years."" He probably could have been more precise if he had used the phrase ""global average,"" because there have been times when the monthly average exceed 400 parts per million at observation sites in Alaska and Hawaii. Beyond that small point, Whitehouse and his staff were on solid ground",True,"June 21, 2015"
"""You don't have to be as smart as a fifth-grader to know what causes the climate is the sun. The sun.  I have people tell me, ‘Carbon dioxide warms the Earth.’  No, it doesn't.  The sun warms the Earth.""","In April 2015, Katharine Hayhoe, a Texas Tech University climate scientist, briefed the Austin City Council on the consequences of climate change on Texas. Scientists generally agree that industrial and auto emissions from the burning of fossil fuels contribute to global warming. But Don Zimmerman, the council member representing District 6, was dismissive of Hayhoe’s presentation, saying there’s ""no way to have definitive science on something so nebulous and so foolish as climate change."" ""You don't have to be as smart as a fifth-grader to know what causes the climate is the sun,"" Zimmerman said. ""The sun.  I have people tell me, ‘carbon dioxide warms the Earth.’  No, it doesn't.  The sun warms the Earth.""   We remember graphic textbooks – carbon paper inside! – and goggles in fifth grade. But we were not quite advanced enough at the age of 10 for climate science; that didn’t roll around till high school astronomy. We remember learning in that class that the sun is the chief source of energy in our solar system, but we also remember studying how greenhouse gases – like carbon dioxide – helped trap warmth from the sun. (We recall a textbook diagram showing rays from the sun smacking off the surface of the Earth before reflecting back into the atmosphere; aptly named greenhouse gases prevented all the heat from escaping.)    SOURCE: Website, ""Climate Change,"" Department of Ecology, University of Washington (accessed May 12, 2015)   So, did we remember our science correctly? Or, put another way, was Zimmerman correct that ""what causes the climate is the sun"" and that the ""sun warms the Earth,"" or was he just blowing hot air?   We asked Zimmerman to elaborate on his statement. ""It’s common sense,"" he told us, ""that the source of energy that drives everything is the sun.""   By email, a Texas A&M University professor who doubles as the climatologist for the state of Texas, John Nielsen-Gammon, told us that, indeed, save negligible amounts of heat generated within the Earth, ""the sun is the source of the energy that drives the climate system.""   Score one for Zimmerman!   But, Nielsen-Gammon went on, everything from volcanic eruptions to carbon dioxide can also affect Earth’s climate. ""If carbon dioxide concentrations increase, for example, the sun drives the Earth to a higher temperature because the solar energy that the Earth absorbs cannot escape to space as efficiently,"" he said.   Score one against Zimmerman!   Climatologist Steven Quiring, Nielsen-Gammon’s Texas A&M colleague, had a similar take: ""The sun is important. It is the primary source of energy for the climate system.""   ""However, the Earth's atmosphere is also very important,"" Quring said by email.   For example, Quiring suggested, compare the temperature of the moon and the Earth. Both are about the same distance from the sun, but the moon has an average surface temperature of about 23 degrees Fahrenheit and the Earth has an average surface temperature of about 61 Fahrenheit. His point: If the sun were the only thing that mattered, both would have a similar average surface temperature.   So why the large difference? ""It turns out that having an atmosphere is very important,"" Quiring said. ""In particular, the Earth's atmosphere contains a number of greenhouse gases that are very effective at absorbing energy (at certain wavelengths) and re-radiating it back to the Earth's surface.   ""If Mr. Zimmerman thinks that having an atmosphere does not matter, perhaps he should try to live on the moon for a while.""   In Texas, by the way, it’s not until Grade 8 that public school students are expected to ""identify the role of natural events in altering Earth systems,"" according to state curriculum guidelines published by the Texas Education Agency, which state: ""Students learn how interactions in solar, weather, and ocean systems create changes in weather patterns and climate.""   And it’s only toward the end of high school that students are meant to learn the ""interacting components of Earth's system change by both natural and human-influenced processes.""   ""Some human-influenced processes such as pollution and non-sustainable use of Earth's natural resources may damage Earth's system,"" the guidelines say. ""Examples include climate change, soil erosion, air and water pollution, and biodiversity loss. The time scale of these changes and their impact on human society must be understood to make wise decisions concerning the use of the land, water, air, and natural resources. Proper stewardship of Earth will prevent unnecessary degradation and destruction of Earth's subsystems and diminish detrimental impacts to individuals and society.""   We bounced all this off Zimmerman, who stood by his solar statement.   Our ruling   Zimmerman said that as every child learns, the sun warms the Earth—and, he said, carbon dioxide does not.   We remember: The sun warms the Earth. But Zimmerman’s bigger point--discounting the role of carbon dioxide in climate change--disregards international scientific consensus",Mostly False,"June 5, 2015"
"More money is dedicated within the Department of Homeland Security to climate change than what's spent combating ""Islamist terrorists radicalizing over the Internet in the United States of America.""","Federal officials have been warning for several years that violent Islamic extremists are using the Internet to inspire people already in America to commit acts of terror. The shootings in Garland, Texas, seemed a textbook example. According to CNN, two men in Arizona responded to social media from overseas and set out to gun down people at an anti-Islamic gathering. Although the FBI had been tracking one of the men and had alerted Texas law enforcement, Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, faults the White House for not doing enough to stop this kind of activity in the first place. ""I think (FBI) Director James Comey is spot on when he talks about the threat inside the United States,"" McCaul said May 10, 2015, on Fox News Sunday. ""And yet this administration, its budget allocates zero dollars towards combating homegrown violent extremism. In fact, within the Department of Homeland Security, more money, in fact, millions of dollars, are dedicated to climate change rather than combating what I consider to be one of the biggest threats to the homeland, and that's the violent extremists radicalizing Islamist terrorists radicalizing over the Internet in the United States of America."" McCaul’s statement might strike you as sweeping -- we spend more money on climate change than domestic terrorism threats. But in reality it’s a tightly scripted message comparing spending within the Department of Homeland Security on climate change to the money spent preventing Islamist terrorists from using the Internet to spread messages in the United States. Through that small window, McCaul’s claim is right on the numbers. But that ignores all that’s going on at the FBI and other federal agencies. The Department of Homeland Security budget Each year, federal agencies send Congress a fairly specific justification for the amount of money they want and how they plan to spend it. McCaul’s staff pointed us to the Homeland Security department’s submission for fiscal year 2016, which included $10 million ""for analyses of climate change impacts on infrastructure critical to national and economic security, and national public health and safety."" Climate change programs show up elsewhere in the DHS budget, bundled in with other initiatives. There is $6 million in the Federal Emergency Management Agency budget (which is part of homeland security) for ""climate workshops and regional resilience coordination"" done by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. So, on the low-end, the Department of Homeland Security asked for $10 million for climate change and maybe more. What’s the request for dealing with radicalizing over the Internet? The administration’s budget documents don’t show much. We found $275,000 to cover travel to send staff to a number of cities such as Houston, Atlanta and Chicago to draw more people into the discussion of how to spot and prevent radicalization. We saw $1 million budgeted for a database to analyze past violent extremist incidents and see what sort of programs work best to head off attacks. A House Homeland Security Committee spokeswoman told us that there are four to eight full-time staff assigned to countering violent extremism. The department has a senior level official who serves as the coordinator of Countering Violent Extremism, but his office has no separate line item in the budget. All together, at the outside, the budget submissions show less than $2 million focused on stopping radicals from attracting recruits over the Internet. The bigger picture As we noted, McCaul was talking about a very specific type of terrorism spending -- to prevent terrorist recruiting over the Internet. But there’s plenty more spending inside the Department of Homeland Security as it relates to detecting, investigating and thwarting terrorists. The Department of Homeland Security asked for $57 million in 2016 just for technology programs to counter terrorists. It wants another $14 million to detect and predict hostile activity. Part of its $1 billion National Preparedness Grant Program to state and local governments could be spent on projects to spot early signs of terrorist planning. Extending matters into other parts of the federal government pulls in many additional programs. The FBI would like $1.9 billion and over 7,000 staff to focus on counterterrorism. It’s Intelligence Division seeks $1.6 billion to ""prevent, disrupt, and defeat terrorist operations before they occur."" The Justice Department would like $30 million for its own intelligence work, and another $14 million to target and disrupt homegrown threats. The State Department recently received $188 million to directly engage on the social media front to undermine violent extremism. Our ruling McCaul said that the Homeland Security budget has more money dedicated to climate change than combating the violent extremists radicalizing Islamist terrorists over the Internet. That is a very narrow comparison. It concerns only the Homeland Security Department and only programs designed to prevent Islamic extremists’ use of the Internet. Within that limited frame, McCaul’s comparison holds up. However, any complete analysis would show that federal departments and agencies spend significantly more money targeting terrorists than they do targeting climate change. McCaul's statement needs that additional information",Mostly True,"May 14, 2015"
"Annual precipitation ""has increased in Rhode Island by over 12 inches in the last century.""","People who warn that humanity is dramatically changing Earth's climate invoke several indicators to prove their point. They note the rise in sea levels, the increase in global temperature and the growing acidification of the oceans. In a May 1, 2015, commentary in The Providence Journal, U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, along with Michael Shank, director of media strategy for Climate Nexus, a group devoted to warning about climate change, invoked those warning signs, and more. ""Global warming is happening, here and now. Its impact is already being felt in coastal states like Rhode Island, and greenhouse gas emissions are undeniably responsible,"" they said. Cicilline and Shank argued that, ""Greater annual precipitation, which has increased in Rhode Island by over 12 inches in the last century, also means movement and mixing of pollutants, nutrients, contaminants and salinity levels, all of which can critically undermine marine productivity."" We know we've seen some wet years recently, but we also know how variable weather can be from year to year. So the statistic in that paragraph made us wonder -- has precipitation in the state actually increased by more than a foot over the past 100 years? When we contacted Cicilline's office to ask for the source of the claim, spokeswoman Alex Macfarlane directed us to two publications. The first is a four page fact sheet from the University of Rhode Island's Sea Grant program which says, ""In Rhode Island, precipitation has increased by over 12 inches since 1905, mostly during non-summer months."" Because the undated sheet refers to a weather event in 2012, it's clear that the ""over 12 inches"" is referring to a time span of at least 107 years. The second piece of evidence was from a 2008 book, ""Science for Ecosystem-Based Management: Narragansett Bay in the 21st Century."" In the second chapter, Michael Pilson of URI's Graduate School of Oceanography reports that annual precipitation data from Providence and Warwick from 1905 to 2006 show an increase of 13 inches. That's over 102 years. So Cicilline was citing a good source, although the data are eight years old. To determine if the trend is true today -- and the congressman made it sound like he was talking about current precipitation numbers -- we downloaded the National Weather Service data through 2014. Rainfall and melted snow totals can vary dramatically year to year, so we used Microsoft Excel to calculate a trend line using the last 100 years, beginning in 1914. The increase: 11.9 inches. And if you take the data back to 1905, a longer time than Cicilline was citing, the increase is 13.5 inches. The trend line (not the actual precipitation amounts) goes from 36.3 inches in 1905 to 49.8 inches in 2014. That's a 31 percent increase in precipitation in the past century; 37 percent since 1905. The months that have seen the greatest precipitation increases are March, October and November. The only month with a decrease has been July, and it's been slight. In summary, David Cicilline said annual precipitation ""has increased in Rhode Island by over 12 inches in the last century."" Reliable but slightly out-of-date sources back him up. The 100-year increase we calculated going through 2014 is just a tenth of an inch shy of 12 inches, but the difference between that and being slightly over 12 inches is just a few drops in the bucket",True,"May 14, 2015"
"""I can tell you with certainty (cap and trade) would have a devastating impact on our economy.""","It’s no secret that Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is skeptical of human-caused climate change. While he’s unsure of the effect humans have on the climate, Rubio is certain that addressing the problem would wreck the economy. ""If we do the things they want us to do, cap and trade, you name it, how much will that change the pace of climates change vs. how much will it cost to our economy?"" Rubio asked rhetorically on CBS’ Face the Nation April 19. ""Scientists can't tell us what impact it would have on reversing these changes. But I can tell you with certainty it would have a devastating impact on our economy."" We wondered about Rubio’s claim that it’s a ""certainty"" that cap and trade would ""devastate"" the economy. Rubio has a point in that scientists can’t say exactly how much of an effect cap and trade would have on climate change trends. But predictions about cap and trade on the economy carry the same level of uncertainty -- a lot depends on the specifics of the policy. Additionally, most estimations show a modest -- rather than ""devastating"" -- impact. We reached out to Rubio’s staff but didn’t hear back. Devastation? Cap and trade is a simple concept: The government sets a cap on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. To comply, companies must either upgrade to cleaner technologies or purchase allowances to continue polluting. Proponents say that because emissions would cost companies more, it’s in their interest to find ways to limit their pollution, through new technology or otherwise. Critics say cap and trade would cause companies to slow down production or pass along additional costs to customers. Quite a few states already have cap-and-trade programs, such as the Northeast Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative among 10 states, as well as the Western Climate Initiative, which includes several states (primarily California) and parts of Canada. The European Union has a cap-and-trade program among its member nations. Existing cap-and-trade programs haven’t devastated their local economies. For example, an independent consulting firm looked at the economic impact of the group of Northeastern states engaged in a cap-and-trade program that has lowered emissions by 40 percent since 2005, and the results were positive. The 2011 analysis found that the program created $1.6 billion in value added to the regional economy. It also created 16,000 jobs, and residents collectively saved more than $1 billion on energy bills. Depending on the policy specifics, different programs would have different effects on the economy and climate change, said Duke University energy policy professor Billy Pizer, though the ideal policy would seek to balance costs and benefits. ""Europe, California, New England—they all have cap and trade and nothing has been devastated,"" Pizer said. ""There is nothing about a generic cap and trade that is devastating."" The European Union program has struggled over the past few years -- in part due to the global recession and falling carbon prices on the continent. However, a 2012 report out of the Environmental Defense Fund found that costs were significantly lower than predicted. The report cited another study that found the program ""did not significantly affect"" employment, profits or added value. Joseph Aldy, an energy policy professor at Harvard University, pointed out that former President George H.W. Bush established a cap-and-trade program designed to mitigate acid rain. A recent study out of Harvard found that the program created annual benefits of up to $116 billion, compared to just $2 billion in costs -- mostly as a result of public health improvements. For a national cap-and-trade program, estimates of economic impact are all over the map. Consider the analyses of a failed 2009 proposal for a federal cap-and trade program and their effect on household costs. The Congressional Budget Office, Congress’ independent research arm, found the bill would cost about $175 per household annually. The conservative Heritage Foundation predicted instead a much higher cost: $1,241 per household annually. On the other end of the spectrum, the American Council for an Energy-Efficiency Economy estimated that a family could save $750 after the bill had been in effect for eight years. Economic benefits from cap and trade could come from more energy-efficient technology and less climate-change related costs, according to advocates. For example, the 2010 Economic Report from the President said the 2009 congressional proposal could save the economy up to $2 trillion as a result of avoided damages from more intense climate change. The Energy Information Administration, a statistical office within the U.S. Energy Department, looked at the cap-and-trade proposal and found that the macroeconomic effects were minimal -- with the bill, economic growth by 2035 would be 0.3 percent less than it would be absent the bill. They also found that a later cap-and-trade proposal would have a similar effect. We should note that one expert -- Patrick Michaels, director of the Center for the Study of Science at the libertarian Cato Institute -- told us the 2009 proposal would have been ""devastating"" to the economy because it involved unacheivable goals and assumed the eventual invention of technology that doesn’t exist yet. Michaels, a climatologist, noted though that this wouldn’t be the case for every cap-and-trade policy. ""It is political hyperbole to say that the impacts would be ‘devastating,’ "" said Gilbert Metcalf, a professor of public finance at Tufts University. ""I agree with Rubio that the economic impacts are probably easier to forecast than the climate impacts; (the economic impacts) are just not what he is saying they are."" Our ruling Rubio said, ""I can tell you with certainty (cap and trade) would have a devastating impact on our economy."" Existing cap-and-trade programs have not proven to be ""devastating"" in their economic impact. While estimates for proposed programs vary, most experts and analysts have found modest potential  impact on the economy; some even show a positive impact. Based on the evidence, Rubio can’t be certain about the potential impact of cap and trade",False,"April 23, 2015"
"""The elimination of essentially every automobile would be offset by one volcano exploding.""","Questions about climate change shouldn’t have been a surprise at the confirmation hearing for Michael Huebsch to join the Wisconsin Public Service Commission. After all, the state agency regulates electricity prices, power plant construction and the development of wind and solar power. All play a role in the amount of carbon emissions that utilities generate in Wisconsin. Huebsch, a former Republican state lawmaker, served as secretary of the Department of Administration under Gov. Scott Walker, who appointed him to the PSC. The question came up during the end of Huebsch’s April 7, 2015 appearance before the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Energy. State Sen. Mark Miller (D-Monona) asked Huebsch for his views about ""whether or not our activities in terms of energy generation are contributing to climate change?"" Huebsch responded that humans have can have an impact on climate change, but said he didn’t believe it is ""anywhere near the level of impact of just the natural progression of our planet."" He added: ""You know, the elimination of essentially every automobile would be offset by one volcano exploding."" That one, well, erupted on social media. Critics questioned the science behind the claim, which has been repeated numerous times by those who do not believe human activity is causing the planet to warm. When we asked Huebsch for his evidence, he responded by forwarding us an email he had sent to Miller after the hearing. ""I answered a question you put to me inaccurately and I want to set the record straight,"" Huebsch wrote. ""To your question regarding global climate change I indicated global volcanic activity can equal the emission output by the automobiles in the United States. That is inaccurate and I apologize for the error."" He added: ""While the scientific community recognizes the natural impact on climate change due to carbon (CO2)and sulfur (SO2) emissions from volcanic activity, those emissions do not equate to the annual emissions from United States automobiles and other fossil fuel based transportation. I apologize for any confusion this may have caused."" Oh. All that said, let’s take a closer look the comparison. Volcanoes: A frequently cited 2011 report by Terrance Gerlach, a volcano expert with the United States Geological Survey, compared carbon emissions from volcanoes and all human activity -- not just motor vehicles. The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991 was one of the largest ever recorded. That event sent about 0.05 gigatons into the atmosphere. Vehicles: According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles in the United States amount to 27 percent of all sources of greenhouse gases, second only to electric power generation. Gerlach’s report says that vehicles worldwide contributed 3 gigatons a year in greenhouse gases. The EPA estimate puts the U.S. share of that at just under 2 gigatons. By either measure, that’s far, far more that a volcanic eruption. The Gerlach report contained this conclusion: ""Do the Earth’s volcanoes emit more CO2 than human activities? Research findings indicate that the answer to this frequently asked question is a clear and unequivocal, ‘No.’"" Our rating Huebsch, the latest appointee to the agency that regulates utilities in Wisconsin, testified that ""the elimination of essentially every automobile would be offset by one volcano exploding.""

It’s been that way for several months at the obscure public lands agency, which is overseen by three board members -- Attorney General Brad Schimel, state Treasurer Matt Adamczyk, both Republicans, and Secretary of State Douglas La Follette, a Democrat. The 10-employee agency is in charge of managing some of the state's public land and operates a trust that provides funding for school libraries and makes loans to municipalities and school districts. The board has been suggested as a potential source of bonds to help finance a new Milwaukee Bucks arena. Since Adamczyk won election in November 2014, he has raised questions about Nelson’s performance and her background as an environmentalist. He requested years of her phone and travel records and unsuccessfully tried to get her fired at the March 3, 2015 meeting. Schimel and La Follette voted down a motion by Adamczyk to remove Nelson, daughter of Earth Day founder Gaylord Nelson. Tia Nelson’s performance came up again at the April 7, 2015 board meeting, and not long after the meeting NextGen Climate, a group that says its aim is to bring ""climate change to the forefront of American politics,"" posted an item on its blog saying Nelson had been muzzled by the public lands board. The group said Nelson had been banned from ""engaging in global warming or climate change"" work on state time and compared the action to a move in Florida to block state workers from using the term ""climate change."" Did the board really order Nelson -- and other agency employees -- not to talk about climate change on state time? Some background In 2007-’08, Nelson was tapped by then-Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat, to co-chair a state global warming task force. During that time she also held her position at the public lands agency. Not long after the global warming report was issued, Nelson traveled to Washington, D.C., to testify about climate change at a congressional hearing and discussed the report in other settings. Adamczyk has called her task force work theft of the state’s time and also criticized Nelson and La Follette for recently attending a land commissioners’ conference in Phoenix. At the April 7 meeting, Nelson defended herself and said she served on the task force at the request of Doyle. She said she hasn't actively worked on global warming since the task force disbanded. ""I have never lobbied on climate change on state time in the entire 10 years I've been at the board of commissioners,"" she said. After her comments, Adamczyk asked for approval of a resolution to ""prohibit staff from engaging in global warming or climate change work while on BCPL time."" Adamczyk and Schimel voted in favor, La Follette voted no. We contacted Nelson and she declined to discuss the board’s action -- or climate change. She did note she was going to be on vacation April 22, which is Earth Day, giving a talk about her father at his alma mater, San Jose State University. Our rating The advocacy group NextGen Climate says Nelson, daughter of the founder of Earth Day, is under orders not to discuss global warming on state time.

"""More than 7,000 Americans lost their lives to climate change-fueled events last year.""","After a long career as a car dealer, lieutenant governor and ambassador, Democrat Don Beyer was elected to the U.S. of House Representatives last year with a focus on protecting the planet against climate change. Beyer, D-8th, reiterated his goal in a March 4 column for the Falls Church News-Press, calling global warming the ""existential crisis of our generation, and of course the preeminent environmental issue."" ""More than 7,000 Americans lost their lives to climate change-fueled events last year,"" he wrote. Beyer posted a similar statement on his congressional website on Feb. 4, saying climate change caused ""almost 7,000"" U.S. deaths last year. We wondered whether his claim is correct and asked for the source of Beyer’s information. Thomas Scanlon, a spokesman for Beyer, said the congressman’s office had made a mistake about the 7,000 deaths. ""That number should be globally, not just in the United States,"" he emailed. ""We made an error in editing this column for FCNP."" That said, we wondered if there was even proof that 7,000 worldwide deaths were caused by climate change last year. Scanlon referred us to a two-page report on global warming issued in January by the American Academy of Actuaries. It said ""global natural loss events"" caused 7,700 fatalities last year. The academy attributed the number to Munich RE, a global insurance company based in Germany that issues an annual report on worldwide losses from natural catastrophes. In a study released in January, the company said 7,700 deaths were caused by global disasters -- including earthquakes, storms, floods, landslides, drought, extreme temperatures and wildfires. But Munich RE doesn’t assess whether whether the natural catastrophes -- resulting in $110 billion in financial losses last year -- were caused by climate change. ""We do not have the ability to identify the direct impact of global warming on fatalities caused by natural catastrophes, other than to say any fatality caused by the earthquake peril are not due to global warming,"" emailed Peter Hoeppe, Munich RE’s head of geo risks research. ""Our data indicate an upward trend in regard to losses from weather catastrophes which, over time, have increased in both frequency and severity."" Of the 7,700 deaths, Munich RE estimated 850 were caused by earthquakes. The remaining 6,850 deaths, the company wrote, were caused by ""weather-related"" events. While there’s no precise way to measure the number of deaths caused by global warming, we should note that many experts believe it will be the root of many fatalities in coming decades. The World Health Organization predicts that an additional 250,000 people -- largely in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa -- will die annually between 2030 and 2050 because of conditions caused or exacerbated by climate change.

"""Many of the alarmists on global warming, they’ve got a problem because the science doesn’t back them up. In particular, satellite data demonstrate for the last 17 years, there’s been zero warming.""","The world’s on fire, according to Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas -- but it’s not because of global warming. On Late Night with Seth Meyers March 17, host Meyers brought up an incident that had happened several days earlier -- in which Cruz seemed to frighten a 3-year-old girl when he said ""Your world is on fire."" (He was talking about foreign policy.) ""At first I got excited because I thought maybe you were coming around on global warming, but that’s not the case,"" Meyers said. ""Because I think the world’s on fire -- literally."" Cruz responded, ""My view actually is simple. Debates on this should follow science and should follow data. Many of the alarmists on global warming, they’ve got a problem because the science doesn’t back them up. In particular, satellite data demonstrate for the last 17 years, there’s been zero warming. None whatsoever. It’s why -- you remember how it used to be called 'global warming' and then magically the theory changed to 'climate change'? The reason is it wasn’t warming, but the computer models still say it is, except the satellites show it’s not."" We’ve fact-checked statements like Cruz’s before -- that global warming has stopped over the past 17 years, and that’s reason to be skeptical of accepted science about global warming -- and found the claims lacking. (Here’s the head of a human-caused climate change skepticism organization, as well as Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and environmentalist-turned-skeptic Patrick Moore.) Cruz does have a point: There hasn’t been any significant warming over the past 17 years. However, the scientific mainstream counters that it’s misleading for climate change skeptics to assume this flat trend line will continue indefinitely, or that it negates the long-term likelihood of global warming. Cherry picking NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies tracks global land-ocean temperatures using a temperature index -- that is, how much the temperature deviates from the long-term average:  As the chart shows, Earth’s land-ocean temperatures accelerated their increase in the 1970s, setting off a new era of rising sea levels and melting sea ice. Temperatures spiked about 17 years ago in 1998 and have plateaued at similarly high levels ever since. Scientists say it’s worth noting that 1998 was an outlier year that involved a strong El Niño with abnormally warm ocean temperatures. El Nino refers to an occasional pattern in ocean currents that significantly affects the weather globally by releasing heat into the atmosphere. So global temperatures have not changed much since 1998, aside from minor fluctuations. The 14 hottest years on record have all occurred since that peak in 1998, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. By starting his 17-year count with 1998 -- an abnormally hot year because of the El Nino -- Cruz exaggerated the nature of the pause. ""Looking at the last 17 years is cherry picking,"" said Brian Soden, a professor of meteorology and physical oceanography at the University of Miami. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations-affiliated organization that shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, has specifically addressed claims about the period since 1998. The panel argues that short-term trends are likely a result of natural climate variability and are not representative of the long-term climate outlook. The panel attributes the recent temperature plateau to changes in volcanic and solar activity. Data always fluctuates somewhat, scientists say. ""The global average air temperature over the past 150 years has been characterized by overall rise,"" but superimposed on this general trend are ""periods, lasting as much as several decades, of stronger warming, little change and even cooling,"" said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center and a professor of geography at the University of Colorado-Boulder, told PolitiFact for a previous fact-check. Barring dramatic cuts in carbon emissions, Serreze suggested that 50 years from now, ""the period of slower warming from the late 1990s to present will appear as just another blip on the overall pattern of warming."" And many scientists fully expect warming to pick up again, though there is less agreement on exactly when that will start. The United Kingdom’s weather office published three reports in which they asserted that temperatures will likely resume their rapid rise soon, though on an uncertain timetable. Climate scientists are still trying to understand the pause, said Rob Jackson, a professor of earth system science at Stanford University. However, he said he would be willing to make a bet with Cruz that ""globally, the next 10 years will be warmer than any previous 10-year period since recordkeeping began."" Cruz’s response Cruz Spokesman Phil Novack said the senator was not intending to cast doubt on climate change science. He said Cruz recently voted to affirm that climate change is real (though the statement voted on did not attribute those changes to human activity, a key point for climate-change activists who say changes to human activity will be required to keep the environmental impact from worsening). Rather, Novack said, Cruz was trying to emphasize the fact that ""the computer models that climate scientists rely on predicted the Earth should be significantly warmer than it is now"" based on satellite measurements. What Cruz is casting doubt on is the idea that we should make major policy decisions affecting the livelihoods of millions of people in the name of theoretical conclusions that in fact cannot currently be drawn from science or data,"" he added. For support, Novack pointed to a blog by physicist Carl Mears, vice president of satellite data company Remote Sensing Systems. In the blog, Mears noted that the company’s satellite-collected data shows that there has been little warming in the past 17 years, and that the observed temperatures were less than what had been predicted by many computer simulations. However, Mears also cautioned that the discrepancy between the model and observation should not be reason to doubt the climate’s sensitivity to human-caused activity. Many factors other than scientific modeling errors, he said, could explain the discrepancy between the models and the observations -- including satellite measurement errors, factors external to the climate (such as volcanic activity), or random climate fluctuations. Jackson of Stanford added that while computer prediction models aren’t always perfect, there are other ways to confirm scientists’ general predictions about the rate of global warming and future climate change. For example, even though the global temperature has stayed relatively stagnant since 1998, this winter saw a record-low of Arctic sea ice, and ocean temperatures are rising rapidly. The fact that the past 17 years since 1998 have been so warm even without a strong El Nino of the sort that occurred in 1998 might in itself be an indication of an overall warming trend and climate change, said John Reilly, co-director of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Reilly also cautioned that models are reasonably good at measuring long-term trends, but their ability to predict specific years or decades (such as Cruz’s 17-year time period) is ""limited."" ""The models are unable to capture some of the exact aspects of how the heat accumulation is being allocated between atmosphere and ocean,"" Reilly said. ""But the fundamental idea that greenhouse gases cause the earth to warm is not undermined."" ""A temporary slowdown does not negate 200 years of climate research,"" Jackson added. Our ruling Cruz said, ""Satellite data demonstrate for the last 17 years, there's been zero warming."" Cruz does have a point: There’s been little global temperature change since 1998, and the temperatures measured are lower than what many computer models had predicted. However, focusing on that period essentially means cherry-picking a timeframe that starts at an extremely warm year and ignores that the first decade of the 21st century -- even as it’s been stable -- has been the warmest on record. While scientists don’t deny that there’s been a recent ""pause"" in warming, they expect it to be a temporary trend. Not only is one anomalous period not enough to undercut longer-term projections, but other types of measurements do show evidence of continued global warming over the past two decades, including rising ocean temperatures and shrinking sea ice",Mostly False,"March 20, 2015"
"On climate change, ""the temperature readings have been fabricated, and it's all blowing up in their (scientists') faces.""","The U.S. Senate may have voted 98-1 that ""climate change is real and not a hoax,"" but the accusation that government scientists have cooked the books and invented a warming trend is as robust as ever. Fox News host Dana Perino joined several of her colleagues this week in casting doubt on the data scientists use to track temperature changes over time. Perino’s comments came on Feb. 9, 2015, as she and her co-hosts on The Five somewhat sarcastically discussed how the fight against Islamic State or ISIS drew attention away from other issues, such as climate change. ""They're (the White House) actually kind of lucky that we don't cover climate change as much as we should,"" Perino said. ""Because yesterday, it was reported that the temperature readings have been fabricated and it's all blowing up in their faces."" Co-host Kimberly Guilfoyle interjected that it was ""fraud science"" and Perino said, ""Yes, I agree."" We have checked this sort of claim before and found it wrong, but some time has passed, and Perino referenced new reporting. So we wanted to fact-check her claim that temperature readings ""have been fabricated."" We reached out to Perino to find the source of her statement and did not hear back. However, a couple of days before she spoke, the British paper The Telegraph carried an opinion piece entitled, ""The fiddling with temperature data is the biggest science scandal ever."" The article drew on the work of a well-known climate change skeptic, Paul Homewood, who on Feb. 4, 2015, blogged about alterations in the temperature records in Paraguay and some arctic locations. The Telegraph article concluded that these changes were part of the ""greatest and most costly scare the world has known."" But when we reached Homewood, he offered a more nuanced summary of his findings. ""I make no claims about the effect of (temperature) adjustments globally,"" Homewood said. ""I feel that by identifying specific examples, we have moved the debate forward by challenging how adjustments work in practice, and whether we can always rely on them."" Homewood’s concerns center on something most of us don’t think about too often: the massive data files used by climate scientists worldwide to track changes globally and in different regions of the earth. Raw data vs. adjusted data Every month, readings from thousands of land-based weather stations around the world are shared through the Global Historical Climatology Network. To measure ocean temperatures, there is a flow of data from buoys and ships. Climate trends play out over long periods of time, and the challenge has been to deal with changes in the way temperature is measured that have nothing to do with the weather itself. For instance, local officials might move a station from a valley to a nearby hilltop. They might change the time of day when they record their measurements from sunrise to sunset. They might change the kind of thermometer they use. In the ocean, the practice once was to haul up a bucket of water. Later, the standard practice was to measure the temperature from the engine’s intake valve. Researchers at the National Climatic Data Center, which is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, have to then come up with a way to work with the temperature readings so they can make apples-to-apples comparisons. What they do is take the raw temperature readings and apply a boatload of statistical techniques to pick out the most reliable data. Where necessary, they adjust the readings to account for the human factors that would skew the data regardless of what happened with actual temperatures. The controversy voiced by Homewood and others is that they don’t accept those adjustments. NOAA says the adjustments -- as was the case in Paraguay -- are necessary to make valid comparisons. ""Such changes in observing systems cause false shifts in temperature readings. Paraguay is one example of where these false shifts artificially lower the true station temperature trend,"" the agency said. Homewood is right that the Paraguay adjustments raised the temperature reported for that station. But what Homewood leaves out, NOAA says, is that nearly half the time the adjustments made by researchers lower the temperature below what was actually recorded. No change in the big picture Perino said that researchers’ theories of climate change were ""blowing up in their faces."" That is not the view of the researchers we reached. Judith Curry is chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Curry believes the issues with the adjusted data are ""greater than have been portrayed."" On the other hand, she told PunditFact that the concerns in the Telegraph op-ed were ""overblown"" and that the basic conclusion remains the same. ""The adjustments aren't of such a magnitude that they throw into question the overall increase in global temperature for the past 100-plus years,"" Curry said. An independent group of researchers called Berkeley Earth have the sole goal of working with the raw data and analyzing it for themselves. Zeke Hausfather is a data scientist with the group. Hausfather told PunditFact that the warning flag raised by The Telegraph article and bloggers amounts to cherry-picking the data. That’s because while some adjustments might make it seem like scientists are artificially raising temperatures, some adjustments at other stations actually would lead you to the opposite conclusion. ""(They) look through all those thousands of stations, find a few that show big adjustments, and tell everyone that they are evidence of fraud,"" Hausfather said. ""You will rarely see them pick out stations like Reno, Paris, London, Tokyo, or many others where the adjustments dramatically lower the warming trend."" Hausfather and his colleagues traced how the adjustment methods changed the temperature data differently around the world since 1850. In the graph below, zero is the baseline. Above zero, temperatures have been adjusted upward, below it temperatures have been adjusted downward.   In the United States, with about 5 percent of Earth’s land area, the official data file raised temperatures compared to the original readings. But the same methods lowered the data records in Africa, and for all land-based readings taken together, the adjustments basically made no change at all (the black line). With ocean temperature trends, the efforts to compensate for the human factor lower the numbers dramatically. ""The net effect of adjustments is to actually reduce the amount of global warming we've observed since 1880 by about 20 percent,"" Hausfather said. ""Folks skeptical of temperature adjustments are welcome not to use them if they'd like, but you end up with more global warming, not less."" Mark Serreze is professor of geography at the University of Colorado-Boulder. Serreze said over the years, many people have vetted the statistical methods that lead to the adjusted data files. ""The features of the global temperature records have been verified by comparisons between analyses from different centers and sensitivities to different ways of treating the data,"" Serreze said. ""The peer reviewed literature is extensive. This is why there is consensus that the data are correct."" For the record, the author of the The Telegraph opinion piece made the same point about eight months ago. Back then, it inspired a similar flurry of claims that government scientists intentionally engaged in fraud. Our ruling Perino said that disclosures of fabricated temperature readings have upended theories of climate change. The source we believe she relied on, The Telegraph opinion piece, in turn relied on the work of a climate change skeptic and blogger. He told us that he was not challenging the overall trends of global warming, but instead wanted to draw attention to anomalies in the data. The researchers we contacted, who have no ties to the government agencies that produce the data Perino questioned, said that while the raw temperature readings are adjusted, the result is a record that more closely matches what has actually taken place. The greater mistake would be to take the raw data as somehow perfect and unblemished. The allegations raised by skeptics like the author of The Telegraph item have had no effect on the consensus that the Earth has seen an increase in temperatures over the past 100 years. This claim has been debunked before. To continue to repeat it moves it into the realm of the ridiculous",False Pants on Fire,"February 13, 2015"
"Says. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, once said, ""Wind is a finite resource and harnessing it would slow the winds down, which would cause the temperature to go up.""","Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, is not popular among environmentalists. A former chairman of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee, Barton is a staunch advocate for fossil fuels and expressed skepticism about the role of manmade carbon emissions in climate change. Barton’s critics like to paint him as blindly supportive of Big Oil and as anti-science. Exhibit A is a series of social media memes that mock him for suggesting that wind power can actually intensify global warming. The most extreme version we found said Barton had claimed that ""wind power would stop the Earth from rotating."" That’s clearly not true, but it’s also not clear that this claim was meant to be taken seriously. Instead, we decided to check a less outrageous -- and more common -- meme mocking Barton. A reader recently sent us a meme featuring a picture of Barton alongside the quotation, ""Wind is a finite resource and harnessing it would slow the winds down which would cause the temperature to go up."" The meme’s creator went on to comment, ""The only thing more stupid than this idiot heading the House-Senate energy conf(erence) is Michelle Bachmann's stint on the House 'Intelligence' Committee!"" (Michele Bachmann's name is misspelled.) Ultimately, we concluded that Barton’s words were significantly altered. What did Barton actually say? As it turns out, the comments from the meme we’re checking stem from a congressional hearing held almost six years ago, on Feb. 26, 2009. As part of a lengthy question-and-answer session, Barton pressed witnesses on some of the risks of shifting the nation’s energy portfolio from fossil fuels to renewable sources. In one exchange, Barton referred to a paper by Jay Apt, director of the Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Center and a professor of technology at the Tepper School of Business. In turn, Apt’s paper relied on research in an earlier paper by David W. Keith, currently a professor of applied physics and public policy at Harvard University. Barton’s off-the-cuff comments are somewhat meandering, but the general gist of what he said was to raise questions about some of the downsides of using wind to generate electricity. ""I am going to read a paragraph which is, if true, very ironic. And this is from Dr. Apt’s paper, and I quote: ‘Wind energy is a finite resource. At large scale, slowing down the wind by using its energy to turn turbines has environmental consequences. A group of researchers at Princeton University … found that wind farms may change the mixing of air near the surface, drying the soil near the site. At planetary scales, David Keith, who was then at Carnegie Mellon, and coworkers found that if wind supplied 10 percent of expected global electricity demand in 2100 … the resulting change in the earth’s atmospheric energy might cause some regions of the world to experience temperature change of approximately 1 degree Centigrade.’ …  ""Now, wind is God’s way of balancing heat. Wind is the way you shift heat from areas where it is hotter to areas where it is cooler. That is what wind is. Wouldn’t it be ironic if in the interest of global warming we mandated massive switches to energy, which is a finite resource, which slows the winds down, which causes the temperature to go up? Now, I am not saying that is going to happen, Mr. Chairman, but that is definitely something on the massive scale. I mean, it does make some sense. You stop something. You can’t transfer that heat and the heat goes up. It is just something to think about."" Reading the full text shows that the meme glossed over some important nuances, perhaps by relying on a brief summation published by Time magazine in 2010. First, even though the meme used quotation marks to frame the comment as a single, unified quote, it’s actually a stitched-together mix of several snippets from Barton’s remarks. Second, the meme ignores that when Barton said that ""wind is a finite resource,"" he was explicitly quoting Apt’s paper, rather than saying that was his personal belief. Third, the meme overlooks that when Barton supposedly said that harnessing the wind ""would slow the winds down, which would cause the temperature to go up,"" he was actually asking the witness a question rather than stating his view. And fourth, the meme ignores that Barton said in the same exchange, ""Now, I am not saying that is going to happen, Mr. Chairman."" In other words, what he was doing was posing a scenario to be discussed further. So, while Barton’s comments clearly show an openness to the ideas he addressed, the meme is off-base in suggesting that Barton was stating his own opinion. For the record, Barton’s spokesman, Sean Brown, told PolitiFact that the congressman ""believes in an all-of-the-above energy plan that includes wind and solar power but also doesn’t ignore traditional sources of energy like coal or natural gas."" Is there any credibility to the idea that wind energy might contribute to global warming? So Barton didn’t say what the meme said he did. But what about the substance of the claim -- that wind turbines can exacerbate global warming? The idea isn’t entirely out of left field, but it’s a lot more complicated than it seems on the surface. Let’s start with what was known at the time Barton made his comment six years ago. The paper ultimately referenced by Barton -- the one that Keith coauthored -- found some intriguing interactions between wind turbines and climate, namely that ""very large amounts of wind power"" can produce changes to climate ""at continental scales."" However, the authors leavened this assessment with a more optimistic note -- that such changes in climate disappear at the global level, and that, on balance, using wind power rather than fossil fuels reduces climate change, rather than exacerbating it. Keith, who didn’t respond to an inquiry from PolitiFact, and his coauthors also emphasized that what negative impacts emerged from wind-turbine use could be eased, fairly economically, by better turbine design and placement. Subsequent research has bolstered this conclusion. A 2012 study that used satellite data for west-central Texas, published in Nature Climate Change and co-authored by Liming Zhou of the State University of New York at Albany, found a ""significant warming trend"" of up to 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit per decade over wind farms, compared to nearby regions that didn’t have wind farms. However, Zhou told the Daily Telegraph that the climatic changes from wind farms paled when compared to the impact of manmade global warming. And Mark Z. Jacobson, a Stanford University professor of civil and environmental engineering, told PolitiFact that a 2012 paper he coauthored found that the impact of large arrays of wind turbines would be to cool climate -- not warm it. ""That paper is the most detailed to date,"" Jacobson said. Jacobson agreed that even installing enough wind-power capacity to power ""half the world"" would have ""small"" global impacts on climate, even though the impacts locally could be more significant. If you weigh the negatives of wind power against the negatives of fossil-fuel use, he added, ""there is only a net benefit of switching to wind."" Our ruling A social media meme says Barton once said, ""Wind is a finite resource and harnessing it would slow the winds down which would cause the temperature to go up."" Barton raised that possibility while questioning a witness during a 2009 congressional hearing, but contrary to the meme’s implication, he did not say that it was his personal belief. Rather, the meme makes fun of Barton by stitching together parts of his comments in a way that is misleading",Mostly False,"January 15, 2015"
"""January through November 2014, the year so far, were the hottest first 11 months of any year recorded.""","The  seasons may change, the weather may shift, but U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse keeps trying to get his colleagues to, as he puts it, wake up to the threat of climate change. As naysayers insist that global temperatures haven't warmed since around 1997, a claim that has validity only because the time around 1997 was an exceptionally warm year, Whitehouse took to the floor of the Senate on Dec. 17 to report that 2014 was shaping up as the warmest in modern history. ""January through November 2014, the year so far, were the hottest first 11 months of any year recorded. So unless something dramatic changes in December, 2014 is on track to be the hottest year since we began keeping records back in 1880.

PolitiFact usually doesn't deal with predictions, but we thought we’d see if the 11-month numbers for 2014 were as Whitehouse described. When we contacted his office, spokesman Seth Larson sent us to the November ""State of the Climate"" report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In addition to monthly data, it looks at figures from the past three months, the year to date and levels of both Arctic and Antarctic sea ice. It reports, ""The first 11 months of 2014 was the warmest such period on record, with a combined global land and ocean average surface temperature of 1.22 degrees F. (0.68 degrees C.) above the 20th century average of 57.0 degrees F. (13.9 degrees C.)."" That's a land-ocean surface average of 58.22 degrees F. (The margin of error for these measurements is plus or minus 0.18 degrees F., which means the actual temperature could be as high as 58.4 or as low as 58.04. The previous record -- 58.02 degrees F. -- was set in 2010. The biggest reason wasn't the surface land temperatures, but it was the increase in the surface temperatures in the oceans, where the first 11 months of 2014 were the warmest on record. Many scientists say that a lot of excess heat from heat-trapping carbon dioxide is being stored in the oceans. NOAA hasn't released its December temperature numbers yet, but the Japan Meteorological Agency has. It has concluded that 2014 broke all records going back as far as 1891.  It may not feel like global warming is a problem when below average cold is sending a collective shiver through much of the United States.

"The climate-change agreement between the United States and China ""requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years.""","During a recent visit to China, President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced a potentially landmark climate change agreement between the two countries, which are among the world’s biggest economies and biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases, and notably carbon dioxide, are produced when burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil for energy. When these gases build up in the atmosphere, most scientists say, they trap heat and raise surface temperatures, leading to changes in climate such as climbing sea levels. For years, one of the key arguments made by opponents of U.S. efforts to cut carbon emissions has been that rising emissions from other big and fast-growing economies, such as China, could swamp any reductions the United States makes. The agreement with China potentially weakens that argument. But congressional Republicans, including incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., weren’t pleased with the terms of the accord. McConnell, who represents a coal-producing state, said so on Nov. 12, 2014, while talking to reporters covering a meeting with newly elected members of his Republican conference. ""The president continues to send a signal that he has no intention of moving toward the middle,"" McConnell said. ""I was particularly distressed by the deal he’s reached with the Chinese on his current trip, which, as I read the agreement, it requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years, while these carbon emission regulations are creating havoc in my state and other states across the country."" Several readers asked us to check whether McConnell is right that the bilateral agreement ""requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years."" We turned to the announcement released by the White House on Nov. 12. Here’s the relevant portion: ""Today, the presidents of the United States and China announced their respective post-2020 actions on climate change, recognizing that these actions are part of the longer range effort to transition to low-carbon economies, mindful of the global temperature goal of 2℃. The United States intends to achieve an economy-wide target of reducing its emissions by 26%-28% below its 2005 level in 2025 and to make best efforts to reduce its emissions by 28%. China intends to achieve the peaking of CO2 emissions around 2030 and to make best efforts to peak early and intends to increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 20% by 2030. Both sides intend to continue to work to increase ambition over time."" Boiled down, the key tasks for China in this deal are: 1.) an intention to max out carbon dioxide emissions around 2030, if not sooner, and; 2.) an intention to increase to about 20 percent the proportion of non-fossil fuels, such as renewables, in China’s energy mix. When we asked for backup on his claims, McConnell’s office made two reasonable points. First, his office noted that the agreement is based on intentions, rather than on ironclad promises with enforcement mechanisms. They pointed to a column by Robert A. Manning, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, an international-affairs think tank, and a veteran of President George W. Bush’s State Department. Manning wrote that ""this is not a binding agreement and includes no benchmarks to measure progress or penalties to encourage it."" The second point McConnell’s office makes is that China may already have been planning to make these emissions cuts anyway. According to a report in Reuters, the 2030 peak date was ""in line with forecasts already made by several state-backed think-tanks, with the China Academy of Social Sciences saying in a study last week that slowing rates of urbanization would likely mean that industrial emissions would peak around 2025-2030 and start to fall by 2040."" In theory, China could ""simply shut down a lot of plants on Dec. 31, 2029,"" Jonathan R. Nash, a law professor at Emory University, told PolitiFact. ""In that case, the agreement itself doesn't obligate China to take action before 2030."" Experts said this is theoretically possible, but, in the real world, unlikely. It will take ""significant work"" for China to reach the 2030 target, said Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at UCLA. ""You can't stop your emissions immediately. Imagine if China said they would stop emissions today. That would require massive changes to implement -- no increases in driving unless cars were cleaner, no new economic growth without cutting emissions elsewhere, and so on. For China to achieve a cap in emissions by 2030, they will have to begin to find clean energy replacements very soon or seriously limit economic growth."" Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University, agreed. ""Given the inertia in the economic and energy systems of China and its recent rates of emissions growth, there is absolutely no way that could happen without … an earlier slowing of emissions growth,"" he said. ""No sensible policy would allow"" any different course, he said.   But as questionable as it is to suggest that China could do nothing until Dec. 31, 2029, and still meet the targets, there’s still a second task for China -- to increase non-fossil fuels to about 20 percent of the nation’s energy mix by 2030. Because no such infrastructure can be created overnight, China will have to start work on this part well before December 2029. Indeed, such efforts already appear to be under way, said Michael B. Gerrard, a law professor at Columbia University who has studied the issue. ""China is engaged in a massive program of building wind, solar and nuclear energy plants,"" he said. Our ruling McConnell said the climate-change agreement between the United States and China ""requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years."" McConnell’s staff has a point that the agreement isn’t binding and may simply be codifying changes China had already planned to make. Still, his claim is at best an exaggeration. While it’s theoretically possible that China could meet its emissions target simply by shutting down major plants on Dec. 31, 2029, experts say it would be much less risky to China’s economy to spend the next 16 years working toward the goal, rather than doing it overnight. But even if China did choose to make a literal overnight shift on emissions, that still doesn’t account for China’s pledge to increase non-fossil-fuel use to 20 percent of its energy mix. Building that infrastructure cannot be done overnight and will take years to carry out, experts said",Mostly False,"November 19, 2014"
"""We have spent $350 million to deal with sea-level rise"" in the Miami area and ""hundreds of millions of dollars to deal with coral reefs.""","Gov. Rick Scott has drawn criticism from environmentalists for denying in 2011 that man contributes to climate change and now dodging questions with the reply of ""I’m not a scientist."" The topic arose during the Oct. 21 CNN debate when moderator Jake Tapper asked Gov. Rick Scott why he was ""reluctant to believe the overwhelming majority of scientists who say that man contributes to climate change."" Instead of answering the question directly, Scott claimed that he had already taken action to protect the environment, including addressing sea-level rise. ""We have spent $350 million to deal with sea-level rise down in the Keys, or down in the Miami area. We spent hundreds of millions of dollars to deal with coral reefs,"" he said. Scott made a similar claim in the debate at Broward College on Oct. 15. Scott’s claim, particularly about investing in projects to combat sea-level rise, stood out for us. Under Scott, has the state spent $350 million to deal with sea-level rise in the Miami area and hundreds of millions to protect coral reefs? Did Scott invest hundreds of millions to help coral reefs? We asked a Scott campaign spokeswoman to provide details about the spending for both projects. As for the coral reefs, Jackie Schutz told PolitiFact that the state had ""$100 million spent on protecting the Keys."" The money stemmed from a mandate by the state for the Keys to upgrade from cesspits and septic tanks to a modern sewer system. Improving water quality can help coral reefs. In 1999 when Jeb Bush was governor, the state required that the Keys comply with wastewater standards that would necessitate modern sewer by 2010. That deadline would later be extended to 2015. To meet that goal, when Charlie Crist, was governor the Legislature approved a bill in 2008 that allowed bonding of $50 million a year for four years for the wastewater program. The bill stated that ""beginning July 1, 2010, the Legislature shall analyze the ratio of the state's debt to projected revenues prior to the authorization to issue any bonds under this section."" No money was actually doled out during the Crist administration, which coincided with the recession. Scott took over as governor in 2011. The first year that the state doled out money was in 2012. But the next year Scott, along with legislative leaders, decided not to issue bonds due to concerns about the state’s debt capacity, according to an article in the Florida Keys Keynoter. In 2014, the state doled out the second $50 million. In August 2014, Scott’s campaign released a ""Let’s Keep Florida Beautiful Plan,"" which included a promise to invest another $100 million in the Keys wastewater project. So how does the sewer system relate to coral reefs? Centralized wastewater treatment prevents nutrients and other pollutants from entering nearshore waters, said Chris Bergh of The Nature Conservancy in the Keys. Wastewater treatment kills bacteria from human waste that can cause coral disease. ""It was a great boon to the Keys environment and residents, but it will not affect sea-level rise in any but the most tangential ways,"" Bergh said. Sea-level rise money A spokesman for Scott’s office, John Tupps, sent us a list of what he said amounted to over $350 million ""to address flood mitigation and sea-level rise."" The projects were administered by various state agencies and included the following, in addition to the $100 million for sewer in the Keys: • $21 million for FEMA flood map modernization; • $122 beach protection projects; • $5 million for the coastal zone management program; • $80 million for flood mitigation in Florida in coastal communities; • $25 million for the Keys wastewater revolving loan program projects. The first thing we will point out is to get to $350 million Scott counted $100 million to install a sewer system in the Keys even though the point of that project wasn’t to deal with sea-level rise. We asked environmental experts if these additional projects should be considered as steps toward combating sea-level rise. They told us that while these projects have their merits, they aren’t long-term solutions to sea-level rise. For example, better flood maps help identify properties that are vulnerable under today’s conditions to flooding, but they don’t deal with future sea-level rise, Bergh said.  These are typical beach maintenance and flooding-related projects. Scott hasn’t taken steps that scientists say would address future sea-level rise such as reducing coal-fired power plants. Florida State University oceanography professor Jeff Chanton said that if the beach protection projects refer to pumping sand onto the beach, that is an ""ineffective short-term temporary fix."" Chanton was one of the scientists who met with Scott this summer and urged him to take action on climate change. The scientists showed Scott how two feet of sea-level rise -- projected by 2048 -- will swallow much of Miami-Dade and Monroe counties. They called on Scott to reduce or eliminate coal-fired power plants; wean the state off carbon-emitting natural gas and oil-fired power; and develop more alternative energy options. The scientists noted that sea-level rise has already caused flooding in Miami Beach at high tide. We also sought out several government officials in Broward and Miami-Dade counties as well as the cities of Miami and Miami Beach to see if they had received state money to combat sea-level rise. No one could pinpoint a specific project. ""I have no idea what he's talking about. It's the first I've heard of it,"" said Monroe County Commissioner Heather Carruthers, who serves on the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact, in an interview with the Florida Keys Keynoter. Our ruling Scott said during the CNN debate, ""We have spent $350 million to deal with sea-level rise"" in the Miami area and ""hundreds of millions dollars to deal with coral reefs."" The state has spent $100 million to help the Keys upgrade to a sewer system, which should improve water quality -- a benefit for coral reefs. Scott omits that it was under Crist that the Legislature passed a law paving the way for the money, and he's wrong to claim it's ""hundreds of millions."" Scott’s office also pointed to a list of projects including flood mitigation, flood maps and beach protection -- and throws in the $100 million for the sewer project -- to make his claim about $350 million to deal with sea-level rise. While these include worthy projects, experts say they aren't directly related to addressing future sea-level rise. They’re typical projects for Florida, not new measures to address climate change",Mostly False,"October 29, 2014"
"""The only candidate pocketing big money from people who want to destroy coal is Mitch McConnell.""","Not everyone agrees there’s a war on coal, as Republicans often charge, but there’s no question there’s a war over the war on coal in Kentucky’s high-profile Senate race. For months, Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell have lobbed accusations at each other, saying their opponent is too weak in supporting the state’s abundant fossil fuel. The latest salvo comes from Grimes, who has sustained accusations by McConnell that she wouldn’t fight back against the Environmental Protection Agency’s new proposal for regulating carbon emissions. In a recent ad — which begins with her ""approving"" the ad while appearing in a mine, helmet and all — she parries McConnell’s claim by launching her own coal-themed attack. ""What Mitch McConnell doesn’t want you to know is that he and his wife personally took $600,000 from anti-coal groups, including New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s anti-coal foundation,"" Grimes said. ""The only candidate pocketing big money from people who want to destroy coal is Mitch McConnell."" We’ll assess two parts of this claim. First, is McConnell ""pocketing big money from people who want to destroy coal""? And second, is he the ""only candidate"" taking money from anti-coal activists? McConnell’s money When we asked Grimes for evidence that McConnell has received $600,000 from those who oppose coal, a Grimes spokeswoman said that McConnell’s wife, former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, sits on the board of directors of Bloomberg Philanthropies, a charitable organization founded by the former New York City mayor and billionaire founder of the Bloomberg media conglomerate. In 2011, Bloomberg Philanthropies promised $50 million over four years to the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Initiative. The recipient had a decidedly anti-coal agenda, including an effort to close coal plants in many parts of the country. According to Yahoo! News, Bloomberg said, ""Ending coal power production is the right thing to do, because while it may seem to be an inexpensive energy source the impact on our environment and the impact on public health is significant."" However, Chao didn’t join the board until 2012. Bloomberg Philanthropies spokeswoman Meghan Womack told PolitiFact, ""The decision to provide funding to Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal initiative took place before Elaine Chao joined the Bloomberg Philanthropies board. Bloomberg Philanthropies’ board members do not vote on individual initiatives or program spends."" But the claim really goes off the rails when the ad says McConnell and Chao took $600,000 from anti-coal groups. Chao made far less than that — $9,400 — for serving on the board of Bloomberg Philanthropies, according to the organization’s latest annual filing in 2012. So how does the Grimes campaign get to $600,000? They also count the $684,186 in fees, stock options and other compensation that Chao made while serving on the board of directors for Wells Fargo. How can a bank be anti-coal? According to Yahoo! News, in 2013, Wells Fargo announced it would stop investing in companies that engage in mountaintop removal, a practice that involves extracting coal more or less by blowing up mountain summits. ""We recognize the significant concerns associated with this practice and we also acknowledge the significant investments made by our coal customers in their mine operations, which were entered into in good faith and in accordance with applicable regulations,"" Wells Fargo wrote in a report titled Environmental and Social Risk Management. ""As a result of our deliberate approach and the broader movement of the industry toward other mining methods, our involvement with the practice of (mountaintop removal) is limited and declining. Wells Fargo will not extend credit to individual MTR mining projects or to a coal producer that receives a majority of its production from MTR mining."" That’s not an insignificant development, but as the Washington Post Fact Checker noted in its own analysis of the ad, that only tells part of the story. For instance, Wells Fargo told the Washington Post, ""Given that we still finance coal companies, we would certainly not characterize ourselves as ‘anti-coal.’ "" Environmental groups, too, don’t agree that Wells Fargo is out to destroy coal. On the contrary, in 2012, Rainforest Action Network, Sierra Club, and BankTrack named Wells Fargo one of the top five worst banks on coal due to ""their relationship to and control over these dirty dinosaurs."" An updated report card from the groups released in 2014 gave Wells Fargo a ""B"" for its mountain-top removal investments, but the bank still scored a ""D"" for its ties to coal-fired power plants. There are certainly banks with a cozier relationship with coal and energy companies. But even though Wells Fargo says it does ""not finance coal-power plants on a stand-alone basis,"" Wells Fargo remains a bank that ""provided $1.9 billion in financing as a lead arranger or lead manager in transactions with coal-fired power companies,"" according to the environmental report. Grimes’ money How about the other side of the equation — that McConnell is the only candidate ""pocketing big money"" from anti-coal groups? As it happens, Grimes’ campaign has benefited some from groups and individuals that are critical of coal use. For starters, her campaign reported a $1,000 donation from Frances Beinecke, the president of the Natural Resource Defense Council. The NRDC was instrumental in helping the Obama administration develop the new carbon regulations on existing power plants. In October 2011, Susie Tompkins Buell, the founder of the women’s clothing line Esprit and a noted climate change activist, held a fundraiser for Grimes at her California home. Grimes’ campaign points out the McConnell has also accepted money from some donors with anti-coal ties. For example, McConnell received $2,000 in campaign contributions from David Litman, a Texas businessman who started Texas Business for Clean Air to oppose new coal plants there. Meanwhile, Grimes’ campaign has also benefited indirectly from outside groups that have helped in the ongoing ad wars in Kentucky without officially coordinating with her campaign. CREDO, a progressive organization with a campaign focused on fighting ""dirty coal,"" has spent $35,000 to air anti-McConnell ads so far, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign finance watchdog. Meanwhile, the Senate Majority PAC, a political arm of Senate Democrats, has put $4.3 million into the race. The PAC has received significant funding — about $5 million so far — from billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer. That’s not to say that Grimes’ campaign is bankrolled or heavily influenced by anti-coal organizations. Indeed, environmental groups have not jumped into the Kentucky Senate race to back Grimes with the same intensity as they have to help Democrats in states like Colorado and Michigan. But there’s enough financial support from anti-coal entities that Grimes’ claim of entirely clean hands is significantly misleading. Our ruling A Grimes ad claimed that ""the only candidate pocketing big money from people who want to destroy coal is Mitch McConnell."" The assertion is that McConnell and his wife took $600,000 from anti-coal organizations. But the overwhelming bulk of that was earned by Chao from sitting on the board of directors for Wells Fargo, a bank that, despite some steps to curb its support of mountain-top removal mining, still maintains $1.8 billion in coal investments, environmental groups say. Meanwhile, Grimes’ campaign has directly and indirectly benefited from money and ads from environmental groups and activists critical of coal",False,"October 8, 2014"
"Says Tom Steyer is a ""California billionaire who stands to profit by blocking Keystone"" and ""is spending big to help"" Bruce Braley.","It’s Republican strategist Karl Rove versus billionaire Democratic donor Tom Steyer in Iowa. Rove’s group, American Crossroads, is up with a new ad that claims the Democratic Senate candidate there, Rep. Bruce Braley, is doing the bidding for Steyer by voting against the Keystone XL oil pipeline. ""Now, a California billionaire who stands to profit by blocking Keystone is spending big to help Braley’s campaign,"" the ad says. ""Bruce Braley, he’s on the side of billionaire special interests, not Iowa workers."" Steyer is identified in the ad as the California billionaire. He has run ads helping Braley and against his opponent, Republican Joni Ernst. Rove’s group is a super PAC backed by millions of dollars in undisclosed donors, so American Crossroads warning voters about ""special interest"" dollars in the race sounds a little to us like, ""Pot, meet kettle."" But regardless, we wanted to review American Crossroads' attack against Steyer. Would he ""stand to profit"" if Keystone is killed? We reviewed the evidence. For those unfamiliar with Steyer, he’s the billionaire behind NextGen Climate Change who has promised $100 million to Democrats in the midterm elections. Some have called him the Democrats’ Koch brothers of the election cycle. How, exactly, would an environmentalist make money by blocking Keystone XL, a pipeline that would carry oil from the Alberta tar sands through Nebraska to refineries in the Gulf of Mexico? American Crossroads sent us quite a few news stories that showed Steyer wasn’t always the hardcore environmentalist he now portrays himself as. Steyer made his fortune at Farallon Capital Management, an investment group he started in the 1980s. According to a Washington Post profile and other reports, Farallon Capital heavily invested in energy throughout Steyer’s time there, including fossil fuels. Steyer left the company in the fall of 2012. ""Investments included BP and mining companies in the United States and around the world,"" the Post wrote. ""Farallon's second-largest holding in September 2012, a month before Steyer announced his departure, was a $220 million investment in the oil-and-gas giant Nexen."" Also included in Farallon’s investment portfolio was Kinder Morgan, a company that owned a pipeline connecting the Alberta tar sands to the Pacific coast. The pipeline is considered a rival to Keystone XL. So case closed, right? Not so fast. As we said, Steyer left Farallon Capital in 2012. But it wasn’t just that he left, it’s how he left. When he stepped down as a co-managing partner, Steyer directed Farallon Capital to divest his investments in the company from any of its holdings in tar sands and coal. That would have included the Kinder Morgan pipeline. Later in 2013, Steyer called for the company to divest his money from fossil fuels entirely. A spokeswoman for Steyer told the Post in June that process would conclude that month. Around the same time, Steyer took heat from Republicans for investing in an energy source he was simultaneously vilifying. In response, Steyer vowed to donate all the profits he made from Kinder Morgan pipeline to a charity. He announced in June he was donating $2 million to that cause. We don’t know if that was the full amount of the profit Steyer earned from his investment in the rival pipeline. But the ad from American Crossroads is prospective anyway, claiming that Steyer ""stands to profit"" from blocking Keystone. Steyer no longer has any way to directly earn money from the Kinder Morgan pipeline. And here’s the kicker: As of today, Farallon Capital Management no longer has any investment holdings in Kinder Morgan. Security and Exchange Commission filings for Farallon show $45 million worth of investments in Kinder Morgan through the end of 2013. But Kinder Morgan does not show up on the investment group’s portfolio for the first or second quarter of 2014. Our ruling American Crossroads said Steyer ""stands to profit by blocking Keystone"" and ""is spending big to help"" Braley’s Senate campaign. At one point, this might have been an accurate ad. Steyer’s former hedge fund, Farallon Capital Management, had significant holdings in a company that owned a pipeline considered a rival to Keystone XL, and under Steyer’s direction, his investment group had a large stake in fossil fuels. However, Steyer has since left the investment group he started, and asked his company to divest any of his holdings from fossil fuels, including tar sands. He also donated his profits from the Kinder Morgan pipeline to charity. Further, as of 2014, Farallon is no longer invested in Keystone’s competitor, according to SEC filings. As far as we can tell, Steyer would not directly profit from Keystone’s demise going forward. So the evidence from American Crossroads falls short",Mostly False,"September 19, 2014"
"Says Rick Scott took $200,000 in campaign contributions from a company that ""profited off pollution.""","California billionaire Tom Steyer’s NextGen Climate group unleashed an ad that accuses Gov. Rick Scott of being cozy with a polluter. ""A dangerous new type of oil drilling near the Everglades threatened drinking water for 7 million Floridians,"" states part of the ad. ""But one Floridian is benefitting. Rick Scott drank from a fountain of campaign cash from the company that profited off pollution."" The text on the screen states: ""Rick Scott $200,000 from oil interests."" Scott’s side refuted the ad and the Republican Party of Florida counter-punched with its own TV ad: ""Crist’s team says Gov. Scott took contributions from this polluter. It’s total fiction. Scott didn’t take a nickel. Scott held the polluter accountable. Shut down their wells...."" Did Scott, who is facing re-election, take campaign cash from a ""company that profited off pollution"" and receive $200,000 from oil interests? We decided to drill down to sort out the facts. Controversial drilling project led state to sue When we dug into the ad, we found a very complicated backstory. The ad’s makers told us the contributions refer to Collier Resources Co., but the story really begins with a separate company: Dan A. Hughes Co. In June 2012, Collier leased about 120,000 acres of mineral rights to Hughes. A few months later Hughes received a state permit to construct its first exploratory well. The public outcry began when Hughes sought additional permits the next year. Residents received a letter in April 2013 from a Hughes subcontractor asking for information needed to draw up an evacuation plan in case of an explosion. Despite residents’ protests, in September 2013, DEP granted Hughes a permit to inject acid deep underground to fracture the limestone. The process is similar to hydraulic fracking, which has been the subject of heated debate across the country, although the industry term for it is ""acid stimulation."" Hughes also wanted to try something never before allowed in Florida. After injecting the acid, Hughes workers injected a mix of sand and chemical gel under pressure to prop open the new fractures and let the oil flow out. That's known as using a ""proppant,"" and it was not covered by the DEP permit, the Tampa Bay Times reported. In December 2013, Hughes told DEP that it intended to start that operation in a few days. The DEP sought a short delay to review the plan, but then Hughes did it anyway. That led DEP to fine Hughes $25,000 in April and order Hughes to hire an expert to monitor groundwater for contamination. After months of wrangling, the state said Hughes failed to meet the terms of the consent order, yanked the company’s permits and filed a lawsuit. Collier and Hughes agreed to terminate the lease, and Hughes announced that it was pulling out of Florida. DEP conducted groundwater sampling and found no contamination, but environmentalists say more extensive testing is needed. ""Hughes is not a ‘polluter’ nor has it turned a profit on the well, which the company unilaterally shut-in due to the controversy,"" Hughes spokesman David Blackmon said. There was, however, an entity that ""profited"" -- though we can’t say they ""profited from pollution"": the Collier Resources Co. that leased the land to Hughes. Blackmon told PolitiFact Florida that Hughes will not be reimbursed for the terminated lease.  Campaign contributions The ad doesn’t identify the campaign donors or company when it states that ""Rick Scott drank from a fountain of campaign cash from the company that profited off pollution."" For those following the controversy, it would be easy to wrongly assume the ad referred to donations from Hughes. But Hughes ""has not contributed to the Crist or Scott campaigns and does not intend to,"" Blackmon said. Instead, NextGen is referring to four members of the Collier family -- Barron, Miles, Parker and Thomas -- who each gave $50,000 to Scott’s Let’s Get to Work Committee in January 2013. PolitiFact Florida verified those donations on the state elections website. We asked a Collier representative why the individuals donated to Scott, but the answer didn’t shed much light. ""Certain individual owners have personally supported the Governor in the past, but those decisions are made individually and without any input from Collier Resources Company,"" said Priscylla M. Oliva, executive assistant to Barron Collier Companies, in an email to PolitiFact Florida. The Collier family has donated to multiple state and federal candidates and causes -- mostly Republicans and conservative groups. In terms of state donations, the donation to Scott stands out. We found one state donation that was larger than the ones to Scott’s committee: Parker Collier gave $525,000 to the Republican Party of Florida in 2010. In 2010, Parker and Miles Collier were ranked seventh in the country among top individuals funding outside spending groups, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Our ruling NextGen’s ad states that ""Rick Scott drank from a fountain of campaign cash from the company that profited off pollution"" and received $200,000 from oil interests. Scott’s campaign received $50,000 from four different members of the Collier family. The Collier Resources Co. leased mineral rights on its land to Hughes for drilling, so it’s fair to refer to those donations as being from ""oil interests.""  However, there are two key elements of the claim that are misleading. The ad doesn’t name the company or campaign donor, so it’s possible for viewers who are knowledgeable about the controversy to mistakenly assume that the donations were by Hughes.  The other problematic part is that there isn’t proof that pollution occurred. The state’s preliminary tests indicated there was no contamination. Though environmentalists say additional testing is needed, we rate claims based on information available at the time",Half True,"August 15, 2014"
"Says Charlie Crist rode on a jet that ""belongs to a serial polluter with a history of environmental violations fined nearly $2 million for polluting water.""","Gov. Rick Scott’s campaign has focused on painting the Republican incumbent as a friend of the environment, which means attempting to show Democratic challenger Charlie Crist isn’t. A Republican Party of Florida commercial released Aug. 7, 2014, lambasts Crist for taking a supporter’s personal aircraft to a press event. ""On his way to an event about -- get this -- green issues, Crist cruised in on a private jet,"" the narrator says. ""That’s rich. What’s richer? The jet belongs to a serial polluter with a history of environmental violations fined nearly $2 million for polluting water."" That certainly sounded like fodder for headlines, but was it true? PolitiFact Florida attempted to pull the permits on this one and find out what happened. Campaign development The state GOP told PolitiFact the commercial stemmed from a plane ride Crist took from Gainesville to Tallahassee on July 25. While Scott uses his personal jet to attend events and has been criticized for a lack of transparency surrounding its use, Crist has often used private planes to help him get to events around the state. This time the Scott campaign took a photo of the 2005 Cessna 560XL’s tail number and traced its ownership. The owner turned out to be James Finch, a Lynn Haven contractor who owns Phoenix Construction Services Inc., a company previously fined for environmental infractions. That was especially problematic for the flight in question, since Crist was attending a climate change lecture by Florida State University oceanography professor Jeff Chanton. Finch, a former NASCAR team owner, has a long history of political donations, giving tens of thousands of dollars to the Republican Party of Florida and John McCain’s presidential campaign. He also has a history of facing fines from the federal Environmental Protection Agency and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. While neither agency responded to PolitiFact Florida’s requests for documentation of Finch’s penalties, we were able to do a little digging on our own. On two occasions, in 1984 and 1996, he was cited for backfilling the bayou at his home. No action was taken on the first instance, but he was forced to pay a penalty and do restoration work on the second. A 1998 complaint about destruction of seagrass and another notice about a potential sewage spill at a Millville wastewater treatment plant were withdrawn for lack of evidence. His company Phoenix Construction Services was fined $23,000 by the EPA after filling in wetlands at a Panama Beach park against the terms of the project’s U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit in 1999. Fill dirt is considered by law to be a pollutant in ""navigable wetlands."" The Army Corps of Engineers issued a noncompliance notice after the company installed a portion of a sewage pipeline across St. Andrew Bay above ground against permitting guidelines. Finch’s company was cleared when the work was corrected per DEP guidelines by 2005. The truly epic saga, however, was Phoenix’s botched work at the Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport, which opened north of Panama City in 2010. Crist in 2007 called the airport ""a national model for economic transformation and environmental preservation."" Environmental groups had complained in 2009 that because of poor construction methods, the site was resulting in ""pollution in Burnt Mill Creek, Crooked Creek, West Bay and the surrounding wetlands."" Later that year, Phoenix was fined $1.7 million by the DEP for environmental permit violations. The agency concluded the contractor did not follow stormwater runoff plans or erosion stabilization methods, allowing improperly filtered water to flow into nearby wetlands. As costs wildly overran, Phoenix and the airport authority first sued each other, then banded together to sue other parties working on the project before settling in 2012. Phoenix did not return PolitiFact Florida’s request for comment. Phoenix continued to do work for the local government, though. The Bay County Commission in 2013 gave Phoenix a $25 million contract to build the county a water pumping station. The Crist campaign said the former governor didn’t know about the environmental fines against Finch. They said Crist hasn't used the plane since July 27. The Scott campaign shouldn't be too quick to point fingers at Finch for pollution fines, however. Finch worked on the airport with Charles W. ""Chuck"" Roberts III, a Panhandle paving contractor whose company was accused of improperly building a parking lot in that project. The airport authority was eventually blamed for not securing the proper permit. C.W. Roberts Inc. plants in several counties have been cited for leaking or improperly storing chemicals or being in disrepair. Many of the company’s infractions did not result in penalties. What is Roberts doing now? In 2011, Gov. Scott appointed him to a seat on the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said Crist rode on a jet that ""belongs to a serial polluter with a history of environmental violations fined nearly $2 million for polluting water."" The plane’s owner, Bay County contractor James Finch, has been fined in the past for filling in wetlands or allowing unfiltered runoff to flow into waterways, in violation of environmental permits. That’s a legitimate definition of polluting, and there’s no doubt Finch has been fined almost $2 million over the years. It’s hypocritical of the state GOP to call out Finch when one of his subcontractors has benefited from a relationship with Gov. Scott. But that doesn’t change the facts",True,"August 15, 2014"
"""What (the Obama administration is) going to come out with in the next several months is you're not even going to be able to burn coal very limitedly in the existing plants.""","Is President Barack Obama poised to stop any more coal from burning in the United States? That’s the message from U.S. Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican running for Senate in West Virginia against Democrat Natalie Tennant. In a campaign ad released July 29, Capito, surrounded by blue-collar workers, warns against Obama’s coal regulations. ""The president's come out with rules that say 'no new coal-fired power plants,’"" Capito says. ""But what he's going to come out with in the next several months is you're not even going to be able to burn coal very limitedly in the existing plants."" We already fact-checked the claim that new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency say ""no new coal-fired power plants."" We said it was Mostly False. But what about existing power plants? We decided to take a look. What the EPA is doing In June 2014, the EPA, at Obama’s direction, proposed a plan to reduce carbon emissions by 30 percent compared to 2005 base levels over the next 25 years. The plan is now in a 12-month review period before it is finalized. The proposal does not say that existing coal plants must be shut down or can’t burn coal. So in a literal sense, Capito’s claim falls flat. In fact, baked into the EPA’s own estimates is an assumption that 30 percent of the country’s energy will still come from coal in 2030. (In 2013, about 39 percent of U.S. power came from coal.) Here’s what the EPA is actually doing. Under the new rules, the EPA has given each state its own goal for reducing carbon emissions over the next 25 years. While the goal is a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gases nationally, every state has a different threshold it must reach based on feasibility, cost and current pollution levels, among other factors. How are these goals achieved? The EPA basically says it's up to states to decide. There are a variety of options, including proposals for states to create regional cap and trade networks, invest in renewable energy and build smart grid technology. And, yes, they could phase out existing coal plants. But experts we spoke with said that’s far from a certainty or the only option. First, the steps toward reaching these goals will be gradual. So to insinuate that within several months the EPA is going to stop plants from burning coal is just fear mongering. Second, it’s important to keep in mind that many of the coal plants already in existence are quite old — most have been in operation at least 30 years — and were on track to be retired in the next decade anyway. Perhaps these new rules accelerate that process, but it was coming. Another reason many coal plants were set to close is because of existing federal rules against mercury emissions. These rules are much more stringent than the new carbon rules, experts told us. But plants that weren’t scheduled for retirement that can meet the mercury standards have other options to stay open. For example, they can retrofit their facilities with technology that will result in cleaner emissions, such as scrubbers that remove some of the carbon. ""In no way does this program say coal can’t live,"" said Michael Webber, the deputy director of the Energy Institute at The University of Texas at Austin. ""What it is is a death blow for outdated, old, vintage coal plants, unless they pay for"" technology upgrades. So how does the EPA proposal say ""you're not even going to be able to burn coal very limitedly in the existing plants""? We asked Capito’s campaign for evidence. Spokeswoman Amy Graham told us that, ""Not a single West Virginia coal plant meets the average standard set for our state in the EPA rule. That doesn't mean that every plant has to close, but because 95 percent of our state's electricity production comes from coal, in order to reduce the state's emissions rate to the required average, coal capacity will have to close."" But that’s not remotely close to what Capito said. In fact, the idea that the EPA proposal ""doesn’t mean that every plant has to close"" seems to entirely contradict Capito’s claim in the ad. What’s next for coal? Some energy companies might find technological upgrades too costly, and will seek alternatives such as natural gas, which is much cheaper right now. But for other facilities, particularly larger ones, the initial upfront costs may be offset by savings from creating more efficient, modern plants, said Dallas Burtraw, associate director of the Resources for the Future Center for Climate and Electricity Policy, an energy think tank funded by government, nonprofits and energy companies. ""We’re going to see a shakeout of older and smaller coal plants, the least efficient ones anyway,"" Burtraw said. ""The ones that remain will have a high level of environmental controls and will run relatively efficiently with a high utilization rate."" States, too, will influence this process when they create their blueprint for decreasing emissions, said Amy Jaffe, executive director of Energy and Sustainability at the University of California, Davis. ""It may be in some places there is nothing you can do other than stop using coal, but there's nothing in the rules that says there can’t be coal,"" Jaffe said. ""States have been given targets based on their existing profiles and will come back to the EPA with state plans for how to meet a target of reduction. Some states that are using coal will continue to burn coal and find other ways to cut emissions."" We asked Paul Meier, an associate scientist and director of the University of Wisconsin Energy Institute, to review what impact the rules might have on West Virginia in particular. Coal plants in West Virginia on average emit 2,056 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour. The EPA’s proposed guidelines would require West Virginia coal plants to average 1,748 pounds of carbon per megawatt hour by 2020 and 1,620 pounds per megawatt hour by 2030, a 21 percent decrease that Meier said ""requires only a slight reduction in coal reliance."" ""This can be accomplished by improving the efficiency of the coal plants, or by displacing some of the coal generation with natural gas, nuclear, renewable electricity,"" Meier said. ""States may propose their own plan to accomplish this, and may also receive credit for increasing conservation and efficiency efforts."" Our ruling Capito said ""What (Obama is) going to come out with in the next several months is you're not even going to be able to burn coal very limitedly in the existing plants."" The proposal Capito is referring to is an EPA plan to cut carbon emissions in existing power plants. Those rules do not prohibit current facilities from burning coal, and even Capito’s spokeswoman said the rule ""doesn't mean that every plant has to close."" Some facilities will close down within the next decade, but many of those plants were scheduled to be retired anyway due to age and other factors. States and power companies have options to continue to utilize coal for energy, and experts said they expect coal to remain part of the national portfolio for years to come",False,"August 7, 2014"
"""Global warming is a hoax.""","Can a 10-year-old debunk ""the greatest deception in the history of mankind?"" One congressional hopeful thinks so. A five-minute video outlining the beliefs of Republican Lenar Whitney, a Louisiana state representative running for U.S. Congress, has been making its rounds on the Internet over the past couple of days. And what does Whitney think is a big-government ""scam"" and ""conspiracy""? The video’s title says it all: ""Global Warming is a Hoax."" ""Energy security is real, global warming is not. It is merely a strategy designed to give more power to the executive branch while increasing taxes in a progressive stream to regulate every aspect of American life,"" Whitney says in the video. The video might not have received much national attention if it weren’t for a Washington Post column in which David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report called Whitney ""the most frightening candidate (he’s) met in seven years interviewing congressional hopefuls."" On top of frightening, Wasserman -- who has interviewed more than 300 congressional candidates -- called her ""fact-averse."" Whitney is running for an open seat that represents parts of Baton Rouge. The race is attracting a large field of candidates that includes former Gov. Edwin Edwards, a Democrat who served time in prison for racketeering. We’ve lost track of how many times we’ve fact-checked climate change denial claims and found them to be False or Pants on Fire. (See here, here and here.) But given that it's still being talked about, we thought it was worth reviewing the evidence again. Whitney's video offers some specific pieces of evidence that are in need of debunking. The hoax We talked to several climate scientists who said Whitney’s claim was ""laughable,"" ""deeply misguided,"" ""uninformed,"" ""disgusting"" and ""absurd."" So is there a mass conspiracy to pull the wool over the world’s eyes? It seems highly unlikely, considering the numerous studies that show overwhelming consensus among respected scientists that anthropogenic (human-caused) global warming is indisputable. Among climate researchers most actively publishing scientific articles, at least 97 percent believe in anthropogenic climate change, found one 2009 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a scientific journal. The study examined published scientific articles and surveyed experts. The study says that the few ""contrarian"" scientists are a vocal, but small, minority. They also found that those scientists denying human-caused climate change tend to have less expertise in the subject than those who believe in it. Another survey out of the University of Illinois found that 82 percent of earth scientists (out of more than 3,000 respondents) believe that global temperature shifts are human-caused. Among climate-specific earth scientists who responded, 97.4 percent said they believe in human-caused climate change.    ""It seems that the debate on the authenticity of global warming and the role played by human activity is largely nonexistent among those who understand the nuances and scientific basis of long-term climate processes,"" the 2009 report said. ""The challenge, rather, appears to be how to effectively communicate this fact to policymakers and a public that continues to mistakenly perceive debate among scientists."" Beyond the surveys, there is a consensus among the world’s premier science organizations -- such as the National Academy of Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the Royal Society in London -- that human-caused global warming is real, said Riley Dunlap, an environmental sociology professor at Oklahoma State University. (Not to mention NASA, the American Meteorological Society, the American Geophysical Union and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.) Dunlap co-authored a study published in 2013 that found a strong link between conservative think tanks and climate change denial books. It also found that a growing number of these books are produced by people with no scientific training, and nearly 90 percent of the books examined did not go through a peer review process, meaning they were not subjected to scientific scrutiny. And the consensus is not limited to just scientists. For example, Admiral James Locklear, commander of American naval forces in the Pacific, told the Boston Globe last year that climate change and rising sea levels are the biggest long-term security threat to the region. Recently, former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who served under former President George W. Bush, wrote a column in the New York Times urging lawmakers to take action to combat climate change for the sake of the economy. David Jenkins, president of Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship, said there is no legitimate reason to doubt the severity of climate change. ""A true conservative would be prudent, listen to the experts and take action to address the threat,"" Jenkins said. His group aims to foster understanding about the environment among conservatives. Some conservatives say global warming is real, but has not risen to levels portrayed by the Obama administration, such as Chip Knappenberger, assistant director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank. Knappenberger said that what’s questionable is how much of a threat human carbon emissions pose and whether proposed regulations will do more harm than good. Climate change skeptics’ talking points have evolved since the 1990s as the scientific evidence has grown, said Dunlap, who has been studying public opinion of climate change for 20 years. They first said the Earth wasn’t warming. Then they said the Earth was warming, but it’s not caused by human activity. Now, many agree with the science, but it’s not that big of a problem. ""But in (Whitney’s) case, she’s reverting to some of the most primitive statements,"" Dunlap said. Her evidence? Whitney’s supporting evidence used in her video is too simplistic to be meaningful. Here's a few of her pieces of evidence: ""Any 10 year old can invalidate their thesis with one of the simplest scientific devices known to man: a thermometer. The Earth has done nothing but get colder each year since the film’s release,"" she said, referring to former Vice President Al Gore’s 2006 global warming film An Inconvenient Truth. Global temperatures have ""paused"" growth over the past several years, but to say this is proof global warming isn’t real is cherry-picking. As we’ve previously reported, 12 of the past 15 years have been the hottest years on record, according to NASA. Tied for the top are 2005 and 2010. (Even the source that Whitney’s campaign pointed us to agreed that there has been no significant cooling trend in the past few years.) The past 150 years have been characterized by overall warming, with intermittent periods of slowed warming or cooling, said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado-Boulder. ""Fifty years from now, and assuming that carbon dioxide concentrations continue to rise at current rates, the period of slower warming from the late 1990s (of 2006) to present will appear as just another blip on the overall pattern of warming,"" he said. Whitney also said, ""Last summer, Antarctica reached the coldest temperature in recorded history."" Ted Scambos of the National Snow and Ice Data Center did record the lowest temperature ever recorded on Earth: about -135 degrees fahrenheit. But Serreze said this is one temperature taken at one location, so it has little to do with global warming. It was more a triumph of technology, because a satellite recorded the temperature remotely. And Whitney said there is ""record sheet ice and a 60 percent rise of ice in the Arctic sea."" Serreze said Whitney likely meant ""sea ice,"" which has had record highs in recent years. Sheet ice refers to land-based features, like Greenland and Antarctica. But this also doesn’t disprove global warming. Ozone depletion and greenhouse gases intensifies westerly winds and drives them south, which causes sea ice in Antarctica to extend further north, wrote Guy Williams, a sea ice specialist at the University of Tasmania, in a Washington Post column last month. In the Arctic Sea, the minimum ice extent (measured in September) for 2013 was about 50 percent higher than it was in 2012, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. But 2012’s minimum ice extent was a record low in the satellite era, so even though Arctic ice extent grew, it was still far below average in 2013. Overall, sea ice (measured every September via satellite) has decreased about 13 percent each decade since 1981, Serreze said. Whitney mentions a trove of leaked emails from the University of East Anglia in England between some of the world’s leading climate scientists. She says the 2009 emails prove global warming is a ""scam,"" and scientists faked and hid data. But several investigations concluded that there was no data manipulation, despite climate change skeptics’ claims. A bonus: Jenkins pointed out that the thermometer Whitney holds up in her video is not a weather thermometer, but a medical thermometer. Our ruling Whitney said, ""global warming is a hoax."" There is an overwhelming consensus among respected scientists that human-caused global warming is real, and Whitney’s supporting evidence falls flat",False Pants on Fire,"August 1, 2014"
"""We would create thousands of jobs in Colorado, if the Keystone Pipeline were to be built.""","President Barack Obama’s indefinite delay of the Keystone XL pipeline has become a wedge issue between Democrats and Republicans as the midterm election season heats up. In the Colorado Senate race, Democratic Sen. Mark Udall recently voted against Congress fast-tracking the pipeline, but said the administration’s review process should continue. His likely Republican opponent, U.S. Rep. Cory Gardner, has called for swift approval, insisting it would be an economic boon to the state. In an interview on Univision Radio, a primarily Spanish-language station, Gardner accused Senate Democrats of holding up the pipeline to placate environmentalists in an election year. ""The Keystone Pipeline would create good-paying jobs,"" Gardner said. ""Not only where the pipeline is being built, good-paying construction jobs, but manufacturing and service opportunities in Colorado along with the Keystone Pipeline. We would create thousands of jobs in Colorado, if the Keystone Pipeline were to be built."" The planned route for the pipeline, which would connect diluted oil sands from Western Canada to Nebraska and then Gulf Coast refineries, doesn’t go through Colorado. So we wondered if it was possible that ""thousands"" of jobs would be created by the pipeline there. We asked Gardner’s staff for the source of his claim. Spokesman Alex Siciliano pointed us to the written testimony of Gary Mar, who represented Alberta, Canada, in Washington and spoke at a House Energy and Commerce committee hearing in February 2011. Mar cites a 2009 study from the Canadian Energy Research Institute that estimates over 15 years ""the development of Alberta’s oil sands will boost U.S. GDP by an average of $31 billion per year, creating over 624,000 jobs in the U.S."" We couldn’t find the original study, but a chart Mar appended to his testimony says Colorado would see 11,200 jobs between 2009 and 2025, about half of which would have come between 2011 and 2015. The chart, however, looks at the economic impact of the entire Alberta oil sands on the United States, not just the Keystone XL pipeline. In a subsequent 2011 study, the Canadian Energy Research Institute claimed job growth as a result of the oil sands could reach 600,000 in the United States, but only if existing pipelines were expanded and other projects came to fruition. A spokeswoman for the Canadian Energy Research Institute also said those numbers did not look at the economic benefits of the pipeline, but ""only the benefits from upstream production of oil sands."" Basically, it’s not measuring the benefit from the pipeline itself, rather the study estimates the effects of Canada being able to increase its capacity to produce oil. The study Siciliano showed us is also from 2009. As TransCanada, the company building the pipeline, told us previously, ""The project has changed considerably since then, including substantial route changes and a new presidential permit application."" TransCanada has stopped touting its own study on the the economic benefits of the pipeline from from the same time period, which estimated about 20,000 manufacturing and construction jobs, and another 118,000 spin-off jobs. Instead, in an email to PolitiFact this week, TransCanada pointed us to the State Department’s analysis of the project. According to that study, the Keystone XL pipeline would directly create the equivalent of 16,100 jobs if the project took one year. If the job lasted two years, the equivalent of 8,050 people would be employed over the course of the project. Of those jobs, 5,400 would be in states where the pipeline and support infrastructure will actually get built — Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas. The rest of those direct jobs would be created in other states. In all, about 42,100 jobs would be created over the course of the project — 30,000 of which would be outside the aforementioned four states. This includes jobs created directly by the pipeline (like the construction work), indirectly (like jobs created as a result of goods and services purchased by construction crews) and induced (jobs created by workers spending their wages in the economy). How many of those 30,000 temporary jobs would be in Colorado? It’s not clear from the State Department study, and a spokeswoman for the department said it wasn’t available. Ian Goodman, who co-authored a Cornell University study of the pipeline, said it’s unlikely that Colorado’s chunk of those 30,000 jobs would reach the thousands. Though Colorado could see some benefits from being in a state proximate to the pipeline, it is not expected to be a major supplier to the construction. ""Most of these jobs would be in the states along the pipeline routing and most of the remainder would be in states heavily involved in the spin offs — pipeline supply chain and/or providing goods and services for Keystone XL workers,"" Goodman said. ""Colorado is not likely to have a big roles in these spin-offs. So it is hard to see how Colorado could be getting thousands of jobs from Keystone XL."" Goodman also said TransCanada has already spent about one-third of the pipeline's budget on engineering, design, permitting, and equipment and materials already procured and manufactured. That means that some jobs and economic development from that part of the project have already been realized. In a rosy scenario, Goodman estimated that at most 1,400 additional jobs could be created in Colorado, but more likely it will be less, perhaps closer to 500. As we’ve noted in the past, too, almost all of these jobs are not permanent, as is often the case with construction projects. The State Department found the pipeline would create 35 permanent jobs and 15 temporary jobs once it went into operation. Our ruling Gardner said, ""We would create thousands of jobs in Colorado, if the Keystone Pipeline were to be built."" Gardner based that statement off an old study that measured the overall impact of the Alberta oil sands on the U.S. economy, not the Keystone XL pipeline specifically. The State Department study cited by the company building the pipeline estimates that the equivalent of 30,000 direct, indirect and induced temporary jobs will be created in states outside the pipeline’s projected route. However, it doesn’t specify how many of those would be created in Colorado",Mostly False,"July 31, 2014"
"The United States is the leading nation in the world ""with the highest amount of doubt about the conventional wisdom of climate change.""","After a 26-year crusade against ""environmentalist wackos,"" Rush Limbaugh has emerged triumphant, according to the conservative radio host himself. Citing recent findings by market researchers Ipsos MORI, Limbaugh said on his July 22, 2014, radio show that the United States leads the pack in questioning climate change, and he’s taking all the credit. ""Fifty-four percent of Americans agreed with the statement, 'The climate change we are currently seeing is largely the result of human activity,’ "" he said. ""Why would the U.S. be the leading nation with the highest amount of doubt about the conventional wisdom of climate change? Why do you think that would be?  I think that's exactly right: Me. There's just no other explanation"" Whether Limbaugh is giving praise where praise is due, we can’t know for sure. But we did want to check out his claim that America leads in climate change skepticism. Global lukewarming We’ll start with Limbaugh’s source. In its first-ever Global Trends Survey, Ipsos MORI used an online poll to survey roughly 32,000 adults in 20 countries (Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Great Britain, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the United States.) Respondents were asked about their attitudes on climate change. The countries were then ranked by the percentage who agreed with the statement. Here’s how the U.S. fared:   Statement Agree Disagree Ranking The climate change we are currently seeing is largely the result of human activity  54% 32% 20 We’re headed for environmental disaster unless we change our habits quickly.  57.3% 31.5% 20 The climate change we are currently seeing is a natural phenomenon that happens from time to time 52% 35% 1(tie) I’m tired of the fuss made about the environment. 36% 54% 7 Companies do not pay enough attention to the environment 65% 22% 19 I try to recycle as much as I can. 76% 18% 14 Even the scientists don’t really know what they’re talking about when on environmental issues.  43% 43% 13 The government is just using environmental issues to raise taxes. 50% 35% 17   Based on the results, the United States had the lowest percentage of people say that climate change is: 1. Largely man-made, and 2. Leading the world toward environmental ruin. The United States also tied India for the highest percentage of people agree that climate change is a natural phenomenon that happens from time to time, though more Americans disagreed with the statement than Indians. All of that gives Limbaugh’s claim credence, though there are a couple of caveats. Ipsos MORI research director Bobby Duffy said Limbaugh’s conclusion that the United States is the most skeptical country is ""probably too simple."" While the numbers indicate that the United States is the least likely nation among those surveyed to see climate change as a man-made issue, the majority of Americans -- albeit, not by a huge margin -- still believe that climate change is anthropogenic. Moreover, Americans aren’t scoffing at the general idea of climate change. The United States ranked near the middle of the nations when asked if there is too much of a fuss made about the environment. And Americans recycle at average rates -- though Duffy noted recycling could be motivated by other concerns such as use of resources and socialization. Hockey stick gaffes The survey itself is somewhat limited. While more than 1,000 people were surveyed in some countries including the United States, other countries such as Argentina, Belgium, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Sweden and Turkey included around 500 individuals. Duffy explained that this was due to client interest in the those markets, as Ipsos MORI is a market researcher. Who was surveyed is also important. Ipsos MORI said the survey was representative of the general adult population in ""developed"" (shorthand for greater Internet access) nations such as the United States. But in developing nations, Ispos said it surveyed a ""more affluent and ‘connected’ population"" to represent an emerging middle class, according to Duffy. To some pollsters, this method of surveying is problematic. It doesn’t make sense to compare the elites of one country to the general population of another, said University of Maryland public policy researcher Steven Kull. ""If you’re looking at public opinion in a country, look at the country. If you want to look at a subset, look at a subset. Otherwise it’s apples to oranges,"" he said.   Still, Ipsos’ findings are fairly consistent with the most recent Pew Research Center survey -- where 67 percent of Americans said that there is solid evidence of global warming, and 44 percent say it’s mostly due to human activity. A separate Pew Global poll found that when stacked up against 22 other countries, the United States was one of the least concerned about global warming, right under China and Britain and outranking only Poland and Pakistan. (Interestingly, Ipsos found that 91 percent of people in China said the world was heading for an environmental disaster unless we change our habits. Duffy said this can be explained again by the sampling approach and mode of interview.) One of the most comprehensive polls we found was Gallup’s 2010 survey of 111 countries. Though nearly all Americans were aware of global warming, 47 percent -- the largest percentage in the world -- said it was due to solely natural causes. About half said global warming was at least partly anthropogenic, a 12-percentage-point drop since the last Gallup poll in 2008. That’s slightly below the world’s average but far below the rates in developed countries.  Lower percentages of belief in human-caused climate change in developing nations make sense, given correspondingly lower rates of awareness, education and literacy, said Riley Dunlap, an environmental sociologist at Oklahoma State University. But in the United States, it’s politics that is causing the skepticism. The ruling Limbaugh said that the United States is ""the leading nation with the highest amount of doubt about the conventional wisdom of climate change."" While he cites an exact figure reported by Ipsos MORI, the study itself doesn’t capture the belief of general populations, only those with an Internet connection. Other polls we looked at indicate that a good proportion of developing countries have higher rates of doubt. But among peers, the United States is one of the most -- if not, the most -- skeptical when it comes to believing climate change has human factors",Mostly True,"July 29, 2014"
"""There are already more American jobs in the solar industry than in coal mining.""","For more than a year, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse has delivered weekly Senate speeches about the dangers of climate change. He frequently denounces climate-change deniers, and urges growth of green jobs and technologies to reduce America’s reliance on foreign fossil fuel. In a May 27, 2014 commentary in The Providence Journal, Whitehouse argued for a nationwide price on carbon pollution. And he expressed hope for a prosperous, clean-energy future and faith that ""there is more economic security in our own American know-how than in corrupt foreign fossil fuel countries."" To that end, Whitehouse noted that there ""are already more American jobs in the solar industry than in coal mining."" This claim is reminiscent of his November 2012 statement that ""we have more people working in clean and green energy than in oil and gas in this country."" (PolitiFact Rhode Island ruled that claim as True.) The solar industry has seen tremendous growth.  But have solar industry jobs actually eclipsed the number of coal-mining jobs? Whitehouse communications director Seth Larson cited two sources to back up the senator’s claim. The first is a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report issued in May 2013 that counts an estimated 80,030 jobs for all occupations within the coal-mining  industry -- a sector of the coal industry as a whole. For solar jobs, Larson cited The Solar Foundation’s ""National Solar Jobs Census 2013,"" which states that the solar industry ""employs 142,698 Americans as of November 2013."" First, let’s look at coal-mining jobs. We checked with the Bureau of Labor Statistics and found that Whitehouse had quoted the May 2013 number correctly. (The more recent April 2014 BLS month survey counted  78,500 coal-mining jobs. Neither of those include self-employed contractors.) BLS press officer Gary Steinberg said its estimated numbers are drawn from ""an annual survey of employers, by occupation,"" based on data sent by businesses. They reflect jobs, not people. We also found three other sets of coal-mining numbers. Spoiler alert: they are not all apples-to-apples. They use different methodologies and different definitions. But they provide an overall picture. A 2013 report from the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration cited 123,227 jobs -- substantially more than the BLS, but still less than the number of solar jobs Whitehouse cited. MHSA surveys the mines themselves as opposed to the companies, and therefore includes contractors as well as regular workers.    SNL Energy, a leading energy data provider, analyzes MSHA data to capture ""snapshot"" industry trends. Its June 2014 report, ""U.S. coal miner employment sustains free fall beyond 2nd year,"" cites an 8.3% drop in  the one-year period ending March 31, to 79,658 employees. That excludes contractors and 33 not-yet-reported mines.   By contrast, the National Mining Association, a trade group, counted 195,494 coal-mining jobs in 2012. The breakdown: miners (including contractors): 137,650; support activities: 6,930; transportation: 50,914. That’s nearly 53,000 more than Whitehouse’s solar jobs number. Spokeswoman Nancy Gravatt said the NMA maintains that the additional support services ""should be included because all of these activities are integral to the daily work in the mines."" But the NMA’s definition of coal-mining jobs goes far beyond those used by the federal agencies, including such transportation workers as railroad engineers and seamen on coal freighters. In other words, data from three sources supports Whitehouse’s claim. The NMA count does not. Now let’s check out the solar data. Larson cited The Solar Foundation’s ""National Solar Jobs Census 2013,"" which states that the solar industry ""employs 142,698 Americans as of November 2013."" The Solar Foundation is an independent, national 501(c)(3) nonprofit, non-lobbying group, that strives ""to increase the widespread adoption of solar energy through educational outreach, policy research, and market transformation."" Their data is considered ""the most authoritative"" by the Congressional Research Service. Its report defines ""solar workers"" as those who spend ""at least 50 percent of their time supporting solar-related activities."" According to its 2013 census, ""approximately 91 percent of those who meet our definition of a solar worker spent 100 percent of their time working on solar."" Andrea Luecke, the foundation’s executive director, said the foundation surveys the ""known universe"" of self-identified solar companies, of which there are about 6,000 nationwide. ""We go out directly to those companies. This year, we made 74,000 phone calls and sent 11,000 emails,"" over the course of one month. The foundation also surveys companies ""that help supply the ‘known universe’ with raw materials,"" Luecke said. ""It’s a census approach, so we’re doing a direct count and extrapolate to get national numbers, which is how the BLS does it.""

Sheldon Whitehouse said that solar industry jobs have now outpaced coal-mining jobs. The most recent data from three objective sources support his claim.

"""The nearly six-year delay in approving Keystone is costing Americans more than 100,000 jobs.""","President Barack Obama often emphasizes an all-of-the-above approach to U.S. energy production that includes a mix of natural resources and new, greener technologies. But House Speaker John Boehner says it's Republicans, not the Democratic administration, that are truly committed to achieving America’s energy independence through a diverse portfolio. In an op-ed for USA Today, Boehner said that Obama’s new carbon restrictions will hurt existing coal plants, while Democrats are standing in the way of House efforts to ease rules on excavating and exporting American natural gas. The White House is also blocking the Keystone XL pipeline, which Republicans — and some Democrats — continue to support. ""The nearly six-year delay in approving Keystone is costing Americans more than 100,000 jobs and nearly a million barrels of oil a day,"" Boehner wrote. The House has passed a bill that would fast-track the pipeline. We’ve taken a number of looks at claims about the economic impact of the 1,179-mile Keystone XL pipeline, a project that would connect diluted oil sands from Western Canada to Nebraska and then Gulf Coast refineries. But Boehner’s estimate of 100,000 jobs was so far above anything we’ve checked in the past, we wondered if new information had surfaced. We asked Boehner’s office for supporting evidence. They pointed us to the website of an August 2011 press release from TransCanada Corporation, the company jockeying to build the Keystone XL pipeline. The release says ""independent studies"" estimate that the pipeline will create 20,000 direct jobs — 13,000 construction and 7,000 manufacturing — and ""an additional 118,000 total spin-off jobs."" We talked to TransCanada. At the time, they were referring to a study by the Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm they hired. But TransCanada spokesman Davis Sheremata told PolitiFact that the study is ""no longer relevant."" Why? ""In this case, the referenced report dealt with Keystone XL as it was proposed in 2008,"" Sheremata said. ""The project has changed considerably since then, including substantial route changes and a new presidential permit application."" The Perryman Group analysis has been removed from TransCanada’s website and links to the study don’t work. There were other important caveats with the Perryman study even before it was discarded by TransCanada. Most notably, the 13,000 construction jobs the pipeline would supposedly create were calculated per person, per year. That means that if the job lasted two years, 6,500 people would be employed each year. A study by Cornell University Global Labor Institute into the Keystone pipeline also said that the Perryman Group report is ""flawed"" because it ""wrongly includes over $1 billion in spending and over 10,000 person-years of employment for a section of the Keystone project in Kansas and Oklahoma that is not part of Keystone XL and has already been built."" So Boehner was citing a 2011 study that was criticized and has since been scrubbed from the website of the people who commissioned it. But are there other credible estimates? The study most often cited is the analysis from the State Department, which is in charge of reviewing the Keystone XL pipeline for the administration. It found that the pipeline itself would directly create 3,900 construction jobs — 1,950 if the project took two years. In all, about 42,100 jobs would be created over the course of the project. This includes jobs created directly by the pipeline (like the construction work), indirectly (like jobs created as a result of goods and services purchased by construction crews) and induced (jobs created by workers spending their wages in the economy). When we asked TransCanada for a more recent study into the job creation potential of the Keystone pipeline, the company quoted figures from the State Department study. As we’ve noted in the past, though, most of these jobs are not permanent, as is often the case with construction projects. The State Department found the pipeline would create 35 permanent jobs and 15 temporary jobs once it went into operation. Finally, the Cornell study estimated the project would create about 2,500-4,500 construction jobs, and includes a total economic impact of about 33,000 to 44,000 jobs likely spread across multiple years. Meaning, it’s possible that 11,000 to 14,600 are employed each year if the project takes three years. We told Boehner’s office that TransCanada was no longer promoting the Perryman Group study. They then directed us to a 2011 study by the Canadian Energy Research Institute, a group that includes energy company executives, as well as government and academic representation, on its board of directors. The institute found that employment would go up in the United States by 80,000 jobs to a peak of 179,000 jobs. But those projections were over a 30-year period, and it includes jobs created by existing Canadian energy projects. Our ruling Boehner said Obama’s ""delay in approving Keystone is costing Americans more than 100,000 jobs."" He was citing a study that experts said was ""flawed"" and the company in charge of the project, TransCanada, said was ""no longer relevant."" The State Department estimated a much lower amount, and TransCanada cited that study to PolitiFact",False,"June 26, 2014"
"""NASA scientists fudged the numbers to make 1998 the hottest year to overstate the extent of global warming.""","On climate change, Gallup pollsters say Americans divide into three groups -- the ""Concerned Believers,"" the ""Mixed Middle,"" and the ""Cool Skeptics."" Believers have a slender plurality at 39 percent but skeptics make up a solid 25 percent. They think there’s little to worry about and that media reports on the topic are exaggerated. Fox News host Steve Doocy gave the doubters some ammunition on June 24, 2014. In a segment on Fox and Friends called ""News by the Numbers,"" Doocy drew viewers’ attention to the year 1934. ""That's the hottest year on record in the United States,"" Doocy said. ""At least until NASA scientists fudged the numbers to make 1998 the hottest year to overstate the extent of global warming. The 1930s were by far the hottest decade in the United States."" A reader wondered if NASA really did cook the books (we love reader suggestions!), so we are checking Doocy’s claim about fudging the numbers. We asked Fox News for their source and while they didn’t respond, a number of conservative news outlets have made much in recent days of a blog post from a man who writes under the pseudonym Steven Goddard. Goddard charged that until 2000, NASA reported that in the United States, 1934 was hotter than 1998 and that the country has been cooling since then. ""Right after the year 2000, NASA and NOAA dramatically altered U.S. climate history, making the past much colder and the present much warmer,"" Goddard wrote. He provided this animated chart to prove his point (the chart marked ""a"" is the old version):  Climate science experts say not so fast Doocy exaggerated the findings in this blog post when he applied it to global warming. The post itself only talks about U.S. land temperatures and what happens in the United States is separate from global shifts. As far as what the blog actually claimed, while it accurately copied the changes in the government charts, experts in U.S. temperature measurement say it ignores why the charts shifted. There were major changes in how the country gathered temperature information over the decades. Zeke Hausfather is a data scientist with Berkeley Earth, a research group that has expressed doubts about some of the reports on climate change coming from Washington and international bodies. Hausfather took Goddard to task when Goddard made a similar claim about numbers fudging earlier this month. The missing piece in Goddard’s analysis, Hausfather said, was he ignored that the network of weather stations that feed data to the government today is not the one that existed 80 years ago. ""He is simply averaging absolute temperatures,"" Hausfather wrote. ""Absolute temperatures work fine if and only if the composition of the station network remains unchanged over time."" Weather stations that once were in a valley might now be on a hill top and vice versa. But the shift could be greater than simple elevation. Stations were moved from one part of a state to another. The number of stations within a given area shifted. All these differences, Hausfather and other experts said, will alter the typical temperatures gathered by government meteorologists. Gavin Schmidt, director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said the raw data used in the blog post suffered from an equally troubling flaw. The temperatures were not measured at the same time of day. ""Over time, the U.S. network went from recording max/min temperatures at different points of the day, to doing it at midnight,"" Schmidt said. In fact, volunteers staffed many of the stations. Before 1940, most followed Weather Service guidelines and recorded the temperature at sundown. Through the second half of the century, there was a gradual shift to recording morning temperatures. This change produced the appearance of a cooling trend when none existed. Comparing apples to apples Better instruments and more consistent methods have allowed scientists to collect more reliable data. But for climate studies, long-term trends are key and the challenge has been how to make the best use of the older readings. In the mid 1980s, the government settled on a list of about 1,200 stations across the country to track temperature trends. Around 1990, climatologists began delivering computer programs to factor in the artificial changes that systematically pushed the readings one way or the other. Over time, they accounted for the impacts of equipment, location, the time of day of measurements and urbanization (more asphalt leads to higher surface temperatures). There is no question that running the raw data through these programs changes the graphs of average temperatures. However, multiple researchers from a variety of institutions have fed into this process and come up with their own computer models. Results from different teams largely match up. John Nielsen-Gammon is a researcher at Texas A&M University and is the Texas state climatologist. Nielsen-Gammon finds nothing nefarious in the government analysis of temperature trends. ""It is reasonable to expect the adjusted data record to change over time as the technology for identifying and removing artificial changes improves,"" Nielsen-Gammon said. ""If there are any biases, they are caused by the quality of the underlying data, not by any biases intentionally introduced into the adjustment process."" All of the experts we reached or whose work we read rejected Goddard’s conclusions. Mark  C. Serreze, professor of geography at the University of Colorado-Boulder, said no fabrication has taken place. ""Goddard's results stem from an erroneous analysis of the data,"" Serreze said. Anthony Watts, a popular skeptic of most climate change data, posted his objection to Goddard’s claim. ""I took Goddard to task over this as well in a private email, saying he was very wrong and needed to do better,"" Watts wrote. Our ruling Doocy with Fox News said NASA scientists fudged the numbers to overstate the extent of global warming. This exaggerated the thrust in the underlying blog post. It accused government scientists of altering the U.S. temperature record, not the record for the entire earth. As for what the blog said, we found that experts across the spectrum found fundamental flaws in its analytic methods. By relying on raw data, it ignored that the number and location of weather stations and the methods of measuring temperatures across the United States have changed greatly over the past 80 years. The experts we reached or whose work we read generally agree that the corrections for flawed data produce valid results. The bare bones approach used in the blog post provides no solution to the issues of weaknesses in the raw data",False Pants on Fire,"June 25, 2014"
"Mark Warner’s ""record is one of acting against"" the Keystone XL pipeline.","Republican Senate candidate Ed Gillespie says Democratic incumbent Mark Warner voices support for the Keystone XL pipeline but works against it. The crude oil pipeline would extend 1,179 miles from the Alberta oil sands in Canada to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with existing pipelines that run to Gulf Coast refineries. The privately-built line could carry 830,000 barrels of oil a day. Environmentalists say Keystone would contribute to global warming. Supporters say it would create jobs and reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. Because the pipeline crosses a U.S. border, it must be approved by the U.S. State Department. The department began its review in 2008 and, three years later, determined there would be no significant environmental damage and asked other federal agencies to weigh in. But this April, the department indefinitely delayed its approval until after a challenge to the pipelines route in Nebraska is settled by that state’s courts. In the Senate, pipeline supporters have tried several times during the past two years to pressure the Obama administration to approve the project. After an effort last month was bogged by partisan infighting, Gillespie blasted an email and news release saying of Warner, ""He likes to tell us he supports Keystone Pipeline, but his record is one of acting against it."" We wondered whether Warner, who for years has said he backs Keystone, really does have a record to the contrary. Paul Logan, spokesman for Gillespie’s campaign, said the statement was based on Keystone votes Warner cast in 2012 and this May. Let’s take a look: The 2012 vote Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., on March 8 tried to attach to a highway funding bill an amendment saying that the State Department’s environmental sign-off on the pipeline the previous year satisfied all federal permitting and authorizations needed to start Keystone. The measure, which required 60 votes to proceed, failed 56-42 with Warner voting against it. Warner said then that although he supported Keystone, he thought it should be used as leverage to gain support for a comprehensive energy bill that would include tax incentives for the production of alternative energy. He said, ""...I will not be voting for the Keystone amendment today because, by making this a straight up-or-down issue without taking advantage of the opportunity to put together the beginnings of an energy package, we’re missing a great opportunity."" The 2014 vote On May 12, a Senate deadlock on a bipartisan energy conservation bill appeared to end any chance the the chamber would consider the pipeline before this November’s elections. The legislation -- sponsored by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. and Rob Portman, R-Ohio -- would have provided tax incentives for fuel efficiency in commercial buildings, houses and appliances. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., favored the measure but was concerned that senators facing reelection this year would weigh down the bill with amendments for Keystone and other controversial energy policies. So Reid, who opposes the pipeline, made a promise: If the Senate approved the Shaheen-Portman bill without allowing any amendments, he would permit a vote on legislation mandating that the White House move past its environmental reviews of Keystone and order it approved. Republicans, however, offered a series of amendments to the bill that included Keystone and a provision that would prevent the White House from moving forward on new regulations for coal-fired plants. Their efforts were cut off by Reid. Warner joined most Democrats in voting to end debate and allow the unadulterated energy efficiency bill to come up for consideration. But that motion was opposed by Republicans and fell five votes short of the 60 the bill needed to proceed. GOP leaders said the best hope for advancing Keystone was to stitch it into a bill with other energy measures. Democrats dismissed that reasoning, saying President Barack Obama was bound to veto legislation that would have prevented new regulations on carbon emissions -- as Republicans wanted. Gillespie adopts the GOP line and says that Warner, in voting to cut off debate without amendments, voted against the pipeline. ""Reid's purpose in decoupling a Keystone vote from the energy efficiency bill was intended precisely to ensure that it failed,"" said Logan, the campaign’s spokesman. Logan’s comments point to an additional chapter in this story that Gillespie does not publicize: The decoupled Keystone bill that would have come up for vote had the Senate approved energy efficiency bill according to Reid’s demands. Warner was among 55 cosponsors of the bipartisan bill to advance the pipeline. Other Keystone activities  Warner’s campaign sent us list of actions and votes the senator has made in favor of the pipeline: Warner has taken heat from environmentalists for his Keystone actions. Blue Virginia, a pro-Democratic blog, in January 2013 listed Warner among 53 ""sell-outs to big oil"" in the Senate. Protesters have picketed him and his office in Harrisonburg and Richmond.  The League of Conservation Voters gave Mark Warner an 85 percent rating on its scorecard in 2013, a downgrade, partly due to his support of the non-binding Keystone resolution. Glen Besa, director of the Sierra Club’s Virginia chapter, told us he considers Warner a solid pipeline supporter. ""He’s not only said he supports the Keystone Pipeline, he’s voted for it, much to our chagrin,"" Besa said. Our ruling Gillespie says Warner’s ""record is one of acting against"" the Keystone XL pipeline. In 2012, Warner did oppose a procedural step that would have allowed a Senate vote on expediting the project. He explained that he even though supported the pipeline, he thought it should be part of a broad energy policy. Even so, its reasonable to count this vote as an action against Keystone. But after that, Gillespie’s claim runs into problems. Each party blames the other for the Senate’s failure to pass pro-Keystone legislation this May. Gillespie’s campaign notes that Warner helped block a GOP effort to amend an energy efficiency bill with a go-ahead for Keystone and a provision that would prevented new carbon emission regulations. On the other hand, Warner co-sponsored a clean bill that would have expedited the pipeline. A review of the record shows Warner voted in favor of a Keystone resolution in 2013. He signed two letters to the president and one to the secretary of state asking them to expedite the project. Many environmentalists put Warner squarely in the Keystone crowd",Mostly False,"June 23, 2014"
"The Chamber of Commerce says new carbon regulations will kill ""244,000 jobs a year"" and cost average families ""$1,200 a year.""","The White House on June 2 unveiled tough new regulations to curb carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants.   Moments after the long-awaited announcement, many Republicans panned it as the latest escalation in President Barack Obama’s so-called ""war on coal"" and said it would kill jobs, raise electric prices and hurt the economy. Among the GOP critics was U.S. Senate candidate Ed Gillespie, who was campaigning that day  in Southwest Virginia -- the heart of coal country. Gillespie, who is hoping to unseat Democratic incumbent Mark Warner this fall, was interviewed by WCYB-TV. ""These new regulations on carbon emissions will kill, according to the Chamber of Commerce, 244,000 jobs a year, every year, for the next 15 years and will cost the average family of four $1,200 a year on higher energy costs,"" he said. Gillespie was referring to a U.S. Chamber of Commerce study that was released May 28 and became the basis for much of the GOP criticism of Obama’s carbon-reduction plan. The national goal of the regulations is to cut carbon emission from existing power plants by 30 percent by 2030 -- compared to 2005 levels. This is to be achieved in part by creating carbon caps for each state and providing options for them to reach their targets, including regional ""cap and trade"" networks, investing in renewable energy and smart grid technology, and eventually phasing out many coal plants. But the chamber study that Gillespie and other Republicans cite assumed that the Obama administration would want to decrease carbon emissions by 42 percent — not 30 percent — before 2030. That’s a significant difference when it comes to the pace for reducing CO2 levels, a point that the chamber acknowledges.   ""We were never saying those were the numbers for any scenario other than the ones that we put forward,"" Matt Letourneau, spokesman for the Institute for 21st Century Energy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told PolitiFact National.  ""Now that we have a different benchmark, we’re taking a look at the rule and the analysis and the model and we’ll see what we can do (to update the study)."" Why can’t the numbers simply be converted? In assuming Obama would set a higher goal, the chamber also postulated that the Environmental Protection Agency would be forced to change other policies to meet the 42 percent threshold. The goal would be attainable, the chamber concluded, only if the EPA by 2022 required new natural gas plants to use carbon capture and storage technology.  The actual proposal, however, does not require plants to have such capabilities. This is important because, as the chamber report noted, plants with carbon capture technology are far more expensive to build and operate than traditional ones.Therefore, the chamber’s conclusion that power companies face $478 billion in compliance costs — $339 billion from construction — is likely overblown. The chamber report said power companies would significantly increase their electricity rates to recoup the costs of building new plants with carbon capture technology. Businesses would recoup their increased energy expenses, the report said, by paring jobs. The EPA was highly critical of the chamber’s report and on the day of its release, blogged that the study was ""irresponsible speculation based on guesses of what our draft proposal will be."" It noted that the chamber failed to consider significant health and climate savings that would come from lowering carbon emissions. And the EPA tipped its hand, five days prior to Gillespie’s TV interview, by announcing its soon-to-be-revealed regulations would not require carbon capture. We also should note that Gillespie, in his TV interview, overstated two figures in the flawed  report: He said an average family would spend $1,200 a year more on electricity; the actual figure was about $200. We asked Gillespie’s campaign for an explanation and spokesman Paul Logan said the $1,200 figure actually came from an analysis by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group. Heritage’s estimate, released in March, incorrectly assumed that the EPA would phase out all coal-fired energy plants. Gillespie said the chamber predicted an annual loss of 244,000 jobs; the actual number was 224,000. In addition to his TV interview, Gillespie posted a tweet that applied estimates in the chamber report to the administration’s proposal. Paul Logan, a spokesman for Gillespie, said defended his boss’s comments by saying the chamber study ""looked at a similar regulatory scheme"" to what Obama proposed. As we noted, Gillespie was hardly the only Republican who used chamber statistics to denounce the White House proposal. Similar comments were made by U.S. Rep. Randy Forbes, R-4th; Pat Mullins, chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia; and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. The National Republican Senatorial Committee is using the statistics in a robocall attack against incumbent Warner, whom Gillespie is challenging. Our ruling Gillespie, during a visit to coal country, said new EPA ""regulations on carbon emissions will kill, according to the Chamber of Commerce, 244,000 jobs a year, every year, for the next 15 years and will cost the average family of four $1,200 a year on higher energy costs."" Gillespie refers to a May 28 chamber study that wrongly assumed the White House would set a benchmark of reducing carbon emissions by 42 percent before 2030 -- a standard that the report said could only met by requiring the construction of natural gas plants with expensive carbon capture capabilities. The regulations, released June 2, actually put forward a 30 percent reduction within that timeframe. The chamber says its estimates do not apply to the goals as announced. There was opportunity for Gillespie to realize the chamber’s assumptions were unreliable. Five days before his comments, the EPA announced that carbon capture would not be part of its upcoming proposals. Gillespie not only continued to use numbers from the report, he overstated some of them",False,"June 9, 2014"
"New carbon regulations will increase electric bills by ""$17 billion every year"" and ""potentially put an average of 224,000 more people out of work every year.""","President Barack Obama’s administration unveiled tough new regulations on existing power plants that seek to significantly curb carbon emissions in the coming decades. Moments after the proposal was released, it was widely panned by Republicans, who called it a continuation of Obama’s so-called ""War on Coal"" and said it would kill jobs, raise electric prices and hurt the economy. On his website, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, put it in more direct terms: ""The president’s plan would indeed cause a surge in electricity bills — costs stand to go up $17 billion every year.  But it would also shut down plants and potentially put an average of 224,000 more people out of work every year."" The details of Obama’s plan are extensive — the proposal is 645 pages long. So how did Republicans come up with such exact (and damning) figures so quickly after the proposal was released? The estimates actually come from a U.S. Chamber of Commerce study that was released in late May. We took a look at it last week, and noted it made several assumptions about the June 2 proposal. We warned that the findings of the study would be relatively unusable if those predictions did not come to light. And that’s what happened. The Environmental Protection Agency announced a goal of reducing carbon emissions 30 percent (based on 2005 levels) by 2030. This is achieved in part by creating carbon caps for each state and providing options for them to reach their targets, including regional ""cap and trade"" networks, investing in renewable energy and smart grid technology, and eventually phasing out many existing coal plants. But the chamber study that Boehner and other Republicans cite assumed that the Obama administration would want to decrease carbon emissions by 42 percent — not 30 percent — before 2030 (a number Obama first suggested in 2009 during the Copenhagen international climate change talks). When it comes to the pace for reducing CO2 levels, this is a significant difference. This is a point even the chamber made to PolitiFact now that Obama’s regulations have been released. ""We were never saying those were the numbers for any scenario other than the ones that we put forward,"" said Matt Letourneau, spokesman for the Institute for 21st Century Energy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ""Now that we have a different benchmark, we’re taking a look at the rule and the analysis and the model and we’ll see what we can do (to update the study)."" Why don’t the numbers work? By assuming a much more difficult goal, the chamber also predicted that by 2022, the EPA (under a different president) will have to change course to meet the 42 percent threshold. The only means to accomplish this, the chamber concluded, was to force new natural gas plants to use carbon capture and storage technology. In September, the EPA said new natural gas plants would not need to include carbon capture in their facilities. A large chunk of the chamber’s estimated costs of the carbon rules comes from the assumption that new natural gas plants will require carbon capture technology, which they say is 50 percent more expensive to build and also more expensive to operate. Therefore, their assumption that power companies face $478 billion in compliance costs — $339 billion from construction — is likely overblown. Letourneau and Boehner’s office both noted media reports that said the 30 percent threshold could be increased before the final regulations are approved. (Of course, it could also be lowered, too.) There will be a 120-day public comment period before the EPA releases its final draft. There are other criticisms of the chamber study. For example, it did not factor in the cost of no action, which the EPA said is significant. The debate over the cost of these regulations will continue, and we do not dismiss offhand the idea that new regulations on existing power plants have an economic cost. For its part, the EPA says that the new rules will save consumers money on their electric bills and will spur economic growth that will surpass the expense. But even if the regulations do have an economic cost, it’s misleading to quote estimates from a study that wrongly assumed a key piece of the EPA’s proposal. Our ruling Boehner said the EPA’s plan to regulate carbon emissions in existing power plants will increase electric bills by ""$17 billion every year"" and ""potentially put an average of 224,000 more people out of work every year."" Those numbers are based on a U.S. Chamber of Commerce study that came out before the EPA announced the regulations on existing power plants. That study wrongly assumed the administration would set a benchmark of reducing carbon emissions by 42 percent before 2030. The regulations released June 2 actually put forward a 30 percent reduction within that timeframe. The chamber itself told PolitiFact its estimates are not based on the goals as announced.

"Surface temperatures on Earth ""have stabilized.""","Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has been attracting a lot of attention recently for expressing skepticism about how much humans contribute to global warming and what policy approaches the United States should take. During a May 20, 2014, interview, Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly asked Rubio, ""Now, you said (a) flat-out bold and fresh statement that you don't believe the scientists on global warming. Are you going up against these people?"" Rubio responded, ""No, here's the point. First of all, I have never denied the climate is changing. That shouldn't surprise us. The climate is always changing. The second point on the science is, the left loves to go around saying there is a consensus, there is a consensus. There is a majority of scientists that say that global carbon emissions by humans causes some changes in the climate. What there is no consensus on and (what) they conveniently ignore is there is no consensus on the sensitivity of the climate. How much is it changing and how much of it is directly attributable to human carbon emission? There is no consensus on that, which is why the models vary so greatly, which is why, despite 17 years of dramatic increases in carbon production by humans, surface temperatures (on) the earth have stabilized."" We wondered whether Rubio was accurate when he said that surface temperatures on Earth ""have stabilized."" Rubio’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this story. But in interviews with nearly a dozen scientists, we received a nuanced assessment of his remark. On the one hand, we found most accepting Rubio’s starting point -- that surface temperatures on earth, which were once rising rapidly, have ""paused"" their increase over the past 16 or 17 years. On the other hand, most of the scientists we checked with took exception to his use of the word ""stabilized"" to describe this phenomenon, saying the ""pause"" is temporary. While ""stabilized"" suggests that we have gotten through the worst of it, the reality, scientists say, is that temperatures will rise again, sooner or later. ""Stabilized"" is ""a very poor word to use,"" said John Reilly, co-director of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Rubio’s word choice ""has no merit,"" agreed Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center and a professor of geography at the University of Colorado-Boulder. Reto Ruedy, a climate specialist at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, concurred, saying that the claim of stabilization had ""no legitimacy."" Even Paul C. ""Chip"" Knappenberger, a scholar at the Cato Institute, said Rubio had gone too far by saying the situation had ""stabilized."" While global warming ""certainly has slowed down considerably"" over the past 16 or 17 years, Knappenberger said confirmation that the situation has ""stabilized"" would take ""another 10 to 20 years."" ""The pace will probably pick back up again at sometime in the future,"" Knappenberger said. ""But when that will be, or what the new pace will be, are far from scientifically agreed upon characteristics."" A closer look at the recent past Climate-change skeptics have made the pause a cornerstone of their argument that concern about global warming is overblown. And at least on the existence of a pause, the statistics are on their side. An interactive chart from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows land and ocean surface temperatures going back to the 1800s. While there’s been some variation in surface temperatures since 1998, it has remained within a relatively narrow band, which contrasts with the rapid rise during the decades that preceded it. (The strongest evidence of a pause is for the past 16 years, but we won’t quibble with Rubio’s use of the 17-year time frame.) Scientists also said that Rubio is correct to point to the uncertainty inherent in climate models. Mainstream climate scientists are taking the pause seriously. As PolitiFact Rhode Island has noted, the United Kingdom’s weather office has begun referring to the last 16 years as ""the recent pause in warming."" It’s worth noting that even at the level of the ""pause,"" temperatures are still historically high. As we’ve previously noted, 13 of the warmest years have occurred in the past 15 years, according to NASA. But importantly, most scientists do not expect the pause to continue indefinitely. The United Kingdom office published three reports in which they asserted that temperatures will likely resume their rapid rise soon, though on an uncertain timetable. Judith Curry, who chairs the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology -- and who believes climate change is happening but has put more emphasis on the scientific uncertainties than other scientists -- said reasonable people can disagree with how quickly the temperature rise will begin and how far it will go. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international body that has been among the most prominent voices raising the specter of significant impacts from climate change, said it ""expects the temperatures to resume increasing soon, whereas certain scientists, including myself, expect the current pause in surface temperatures to continue for another decade or two,"" Curry said. We couldn’t find any experts who believe temperatures have ""stabilized"" in the sense of settling down into a consistent pattern indefinitely. ""Increases in Earth's temperature have indeed slowed, but have certainly not stabilized,"" said Rob Jackson, an earth sciences professor at Stanford University. ""Every year is now what would have been a record year in the 1990s, and the last decade was the warmest in the modern record."" Rubio’s statement ""is misleading, because it implies that the climate has reached a balance or equilibrium, so that global temperatures will not rise in the future,"" agreed Brian Soden, a professor of meteorology and physical oceanography at the University of Miami. ""However, the earth's climate has not stabilized. In particular, the flow of energy into and out of the planet is not in balance. It is gaining more energy than it is losing, due to increased greenhouse gases, and therefore future warming is unavoidable."" Explaining the paradox of the 'pause' The central paradox Rubio points out -- an increase in carbon dioxide emissions without a commensurate rise in surface temperatures -- has prompted several theories to explain it. One reason is that, over the long term, data always fluctuates somewhat. ""The global average air temperature over the past 150 years has been characterized by overall rise,"" but superimposed on this general trend are ""periods, lasting as much as several decades, of stronger warming, little change and even cooling,"" said Serreze of the University of Colorado-Boulder. Barring dramatic cuts in carbon emissions, Serreze suggested that 50 years from now, ""the period of slower warming from the late 1990s to present will appear as just another blip on the overall pattern of warming."" Some experts add that starting the count in 1998 exaggerates the ""pause,"" since that was an unusually strong ""El Nino"" year. El Nino is an occasional pattern in ocean currents that significantly affects the weather globally, including raising global temperatures by releasing ""tremendous amounts of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere,"" said Jennifer Francis, a research professor at the Institute of Marine and Coastal Sciences at Rutgers University. ""To look at the trend of a relatively short period that started out with an extraordinary El Nino event causing a huge temperature spike is a cheap device,"" said Reto Ruedy of NASA’s Goddard Institute. The physical explanation gaining the most traction is that ""the oceans have accumulated most of the heat from human-induced global warming,"" said Harold Wanless, University of Miami geological sciences professor. One recent paper found that in one part of the Pacific, middle-depth temperatures have been rising 15 times faster over the past six decades than at any other time over the past 10,000 years. Other papers have found similar evidence. Basic physics teaches that water has an immense ability to take in and hold heat -- but that same heat will eventually be released. ""The trapped heat is still in the system, and it will be released into the atmosphere when the recent pattern of Pacific Ocean temperatures switches back to its warmer phase,"" said Francis of Rutgers. Other factors may also be playing a role in the ""pause,"" said Reilly of MIT. In addition to an absence of strong El Nino events since 1998, Reilly said, the eruption of some moderate volcanoes may have produced cooling effects that counteracted some of the heating. And there’s evidence that the long-term data sets for temperature have under-recorded Arctic regions where temperatures have been rising most rapidly. ""So, several factors that are known sources of variability in the climate system all, by coincidence, contributed to a cooling trend over the period,"" Reilly said. This suggests that global warming ""was occurring -- it's just that the added warmth was going into the ocean.  It’s unlikely that all of these coincidences will continue, or continue to offset warming."" Our ruling Rubio said that ""surface temperatures in the earth have stabilized."" He has a point that over roughly the past decade and a half, global surface temperatures have ""paused,"" particularly compared to their rapid rise in previous decades. But scientists we interviewed agreed that the use of the word ""stabilized"" represents an unjustified leap from the data, since ""stabilized"" suggests that we have gotten through the worst of climate change. At the very least, the uncertainty inherent in climate forecasting makes such a claim of ""stabilization"" premature. More likely, the evidence suggests that the ""pause"" in global surface temperatures is temporary, with temperatures poised to rise once the oceans start releasing more heat, such as during an El Nino event. It’s not clear when temperatures will rise again, but few scientists doubt that temperatures will rise again at some point",Mostly False,"May 27, 2014"
"Cap and trade legislation ""was originally a Republican idea.""","U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a GOP presidential contender, made waves about climate change in a May 11 interview with ABC’s Jonathan Karl on This Week. ""I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it,"" Rubio said. ""And I do not believe that the laws that they propose we pass will do anything about it. Except it will destroy our economy."" One of Florida’s other nationally watched politicians -- Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz -- criticized her fellow Floridian’s stance. After a May 13 speech at Daemen College in upstate New York, an audience member asked her how to get ""Congress unstuck in stomping on science."" Wasserman Schultz suggested that voters stop electing tea party-aligned politicians -- and then she turned her sights on Rubio for disagreeing with the scientific consensus that climate change is man-made. Wasserman Schultz, who represents parts of Broward and Miami-Dade counties, said rising sea levels and flooding will make part of her district uninhabitable in the future. She called for politicians to reach across the aisle in search of solutions, singling out a cap and trade plan as an area where the parties could agree. ""That was originally a Republican idea. It was developed in the 1970s when the Clean Air Act was initially adopted."" We decided to check Wasserman Schultz’s claim that cap and trade was originally a Republican idea. Cap and trade The idea of cap and trade is that the government sets a limit (the cap) on how much carbon individual companies -- typically electric utilities and manufacturers -- can emit. The government then issues permits to companies and allows them to buy and sell the permits as needed (the trade). If the policy works as planned, overall emissions decline, companies determine for themselves the best way to lower emissions, and the free market rewards those who lower emissions most effectively. Wasserman Schultz started the clock ticking in the 1970s. Her spokesman, Sean Bartlett, told PolitiFact Florida that ""the 1977 Clean Air Act amendments were the first time federal law used the concept of offset mechanisms that ultimately became the ‘cap and trade’ systems."" That law included precursor ideas, such as providing industry with flexibility to meet limits, rather than simply imposing controlling regulations, said Eric Pooley, a spokesman for the Environmental Defense Fund and author of The Climate War: True Believers, Power Brokers, and the Fight to Save the Earth. In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan used a cap and trade system to phase out leaded gasoline, noted MIT economics professor Richard Schmalensee and Harvard Kennedy School government professor Robert Stavins. In 1989, President George H. W. Bush proposed the use of a cap and trade system to cut by half sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants and consequent acid rain, they wrote in a Boston Globe op-ed in 2010. ""An initially resistant Democratic Congress overwhelmingly endorsed the proposal,"" the professors wrote. ""The landmark Clean Air Act amendments of 1990 passed the Senate 89 to 10 and the House 401 to 25."" Bush not only accepted the cap, but he sided with environmentalists who wanted a larger cut than his own advisers, according to Smithsonian Magazine, in a report that detailed how the Environmental Defense Fund worked with Bush’s White House to make cap and trade a reality. ""George H. W. Bush does indeed deserve enormous credit for being the champion of the cap and trade program for sulfur dioxide, a major cause of acid rain,"" Pooley said. ""That has led many over the years to refer to it as a Republican idea."" But Pooley said that Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -- a Democrat -- also deserves credit for leading the legislative charge that ultimately passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority. ""So if pressed, I would call it a bipartisan idea that was championed by a Republican president,"" he told PolitiFact Florida. In 2005, the EPA under President George W. Bush issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule, which aimed to achieve ""the largest reduction in air pollution in more than a decade"" using cap and trade, wrote Stavins and Schmalensee. They noted the contributions under Reagan and both Bushes to argue that cap and trade should be embraced by Republicans as well as Democrats. ""After all, these policies were innovations developed by conservatives in the Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush administrations (and once strongly condemned by liberals),"" they wrote. In 2003, McCain, an Arizona Republican, and Sen. Joe Lieberman, then a Democrat from Connecticut, introduced the ""Climate Stewardship Act,"" which would have used a similar cap and trade approach to reduce carbon pollution linked to global warming. Versions of the bill were reintroduced in 2005 and 2007. That was the first time legislation was introduced to use cap and trade for carbon emissions, Pooley told PolitiFact. ""The enormous economic costs of damage caused by air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions to the environment and human health are not factored into the price of power produced by fossil-fueled technologies,"" McCain said in a floor speech to mark the bill’s 2007 introduction. ""Yet, it’s a cost that we all bear, too often in terms of ill-health and diminished quality of life."" McCain’s 2007 version was co-sponsored by Illinois Democratic Sen. Barack Obama. And both McCain and Obama had cap and trade programs in their presidential platforms. In June 2009, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives passed a cap and trade bill, by a razor-thin margin, 219-212. But the bill failed to survive in the Senate amid Republican opposition. In 2011, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives has taken a firm stand against a cap and trade bill. ""A full-blown fleecing of the middle class, it would raise electricity prices, increase gasoline prices, and ship American jobs to countries like China and India,"" wrote John Boehner, now the Speaker of the House, about the bill in June 2010. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said that cap and trade legislation ""was originally a Republican idea."" Experts who have followed the history of the environmental policy focus on the fact that emissions trading to address acid rain became part of the Clean Air Act of 1990 under Bush. The legislation ultimately passed with bipartisan support under a Republican president. More recently, another prominent Republican -- McCain -- co-sponsored cap and trade legislation. Democrats did support cap and trade legislations at different points along the way. But we found a strong tradition of support from Republican presidents for cap and trade, which uses markets to try to reduce pollution",Mostly True,"May 23, 2014"
"Human activity is not ""causing these dramatic changes to our climate.""","Scientists have been issuing more new reports on the irreversible effects of climate change in recent weeks. Two groups reported on May 12, 2014, that the global sea level will rise at least 10 feet, accelerating to a dangerous pace after the next century. Just a day before those reports were released, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., sat down with ABC’s Jonathan Karl on This Week. Talk turned to climate change, where the possible Republican presidential candidate denied a link between humans and the changing environment. ""I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it,"" he said. ""And I do not believe that the laws that they propose we pass will do anything about it. Except it will destroy our economy."" We’ve noted before that Rubio has disputed the basic science of climate change. So when Rubio said human activity isn’t causing changes to the environment, he’s got it all wrong. In this case, Rubio framed his thoughts about climate change as his personal opinion. But the causes of global warming are backed up by thorough research, so we didn’t see room for debate in Rubio’s claim. Rubio’s said before, ""I’m not a scientist, man."" So PolitiFact reached out to scientists who could explain the facts behind climate change. We've rated similar claims False from Tim Pawlenty and Rick Perry, but we'll rate it again because it's a persistent claim we see year after year. Rubio’s staff didn’t return our request for comment. How our climate is changing Historically, the earth goes through periods of hotter and cooler temperatures. So how do we know global warming isn’t a natural part of this cycle? By taking measurements, said Leonard Berry, director of Florida Atlantic University’s Center for Environmental Studies. ""We can measure the fact that the earth is warming. We can measure the fact that the ocean is warming,"" Berry said. ""While geological history shows warming and cooling periods, as far back as we go, none shows the kind of warming and the kind of changes we’re experiencing right now."" Scientists trace back this shift to the Industrial Revolution, which began in 1760. Since that period, carbon dioxide rose 40 percent and methane by 150 percent. High levels of these and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap heat at the surface of the earth, warming the planet. By burning fossil fuels, chopping down trees, and using fertilizer, humans have directly contributed to global warming. The connection between increased levels of greenhouse gases and rising temperature has been confirmed by scientists for over a century, said Jennifer Francis, a Rutgers University marine and coastal sciences professor. ""There is as much uncertainty about this connection as there is about what will happen when you drop an object,"" Francis said. ""It will fall."" The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is also on board with human activity as a cause. They reported that were it not for human impact, the likely effect of natural changes to the environment would’ve been one of cooling, not warming. They cite ""very high confidence"" that human activities caused a change of course. The U.S. Global Change Research program published a 2014 report on climate change. It doesn’t debate whether human activity causes climate change. Rather, it focuses on what actions to take to lessen its effects. A May 2013 report analyzing all scientific papers that address the causes of climate change showed 97.1 percent of findings that took a position agree that there’s been a negative human impact on the atmosphere. Comedian John Oliver cleverly addressed the debate’s conclusiveness on a recent Last Week Tonight episode by arranging a representative debate between 97 climate change scientists and three deniers. As a politician from Florida, Rubio must contend with research that pegs Miami and Tampa as two of the U.S. cities most likely to be impacted by climate change. Rising sea levels will make them more prone to flooding. ""Whatever the cause of climate change, the impacts on Florida are already important and that it would be difficult for responsible people in Florida to ignore that fact,"" Berry said. Our ruling Rubio said human activity is not ""causing these dramatic changes to our climate."" An overwhelming majority of scientists agree that humans, by burning fossil fuels, contribute directly to global warming. Not only is Rubio incorrect, but he’s ignoring a mountain of concrete, scientific research",False,"May 13, 2014"
"Americans ""bought into climate change"" in 2004-06, but then most ""began wandering away from this issue.""","As Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio edges closer to a 2016 presidential bid, he wants Republican primary voters to know where he stands on litmus test issues like climate change. ""I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate,"" Rubio said on ABC's This Week. ""I do not believe that the laws that they propose we pass will do anything about it, except it will destroy our economy."" Many Republican voters would nod in agreement, but the question is, how well does this view sit with the public at large? Joe Scarborough, host of MSNBC’s Morning Joe, said Rubio might be on relatively safe ground with the public. ""From 2004, 2005, 2006, Americans were bought in to the concept of climate change and that we need to move aggressively on it,"" Scarborough said. But since then, the public shifted, he said. ""Check the polling: Most Americans began wandering away from this issue,"" Scarborough said. From Scarborough’s lips to our ears. In this fact-check, we review the polls on climate change and global warming (terms that are used interchangeably) to see if Americans care less than they did half a dozen years ago. Pollsters get at this question in a few ways. We’ll look at each one. Is it happening? For nearly 15 years, the Gallup organization has been asking people if they think global warming is underway. In 2002, 71 percent of the public said it is happening or will happen in their lifetime. That percentage peaked at 75 percent in 2008 and then fell. It reached a low of 62 percent in 2011 and since then has risen slightly. As of March 2014, it stood at 65 percent. With a margin of error of 4 percent, the result is modestly less than what Gallup reported in 2002. We find similar but slightly larger swings of opinion in the Pew Research Center data, although the Pew survey only goes back to 2006. Pew asks if people see solid evidence that the earth is warming. In 2006, 77 percent said yes. That fell to 57 percent in 2009, then rose to 67 percent in 2013. The trends don't exactly match the pattern Scarborough described. He suggested a simple slide down. In reality, there’s more of an up-down-up. Still, the public seems a little less certain about climate change today than in the mid 2000s. Is it something you worry about? Even if you believe the climate is changing, it might not cause you great concern. A group of university researchers from Drexel, McGill and Ohio State blended the results from a number of surveys to derive what they called the Climate Change Threat Index. Basically, the index captures whether people take the issue seriously. Robert Brulle, a sociologist at Drexel University, is part of the team. From 2002 to 2005, the value of the index fluctuated between 40 and 45. (These are abstract units and should not be confused with the percentage of people who care.) Then it gained about 10 points. ""The big shift started in 2006 and coincided with the release of Al Gore’s movie  An Inconvenient Truth,"" Brulle said. ""It dropped off in the fall of 2008 after the big recession and the Wall Street meltdown."" Today, the index is about where is was in 2004. Again, up-down-up. Interestingly, Brulle and his colleagues Jason Carmichael and J. Craig Jenkins found that two factors primarily drive public concern about climate change. First, people worry more about it so long as more pressing problems like the economy don’t loom larger. Second, Republicans effectively can dial concern up or down. The partisan split on this issue shows up in every survey. The more Republican the voter, the less likely they are to say climate change is real or that it will make a difference. When Republican leaders are more vocal in their rejection of climate change (such as voting against a particular bill), public concern falls, at least among Republican leaning voters. When those leaders treat it more seriously, concern rises. But do you worry about it a lot? Gallup gets at the level of concern by asking people if they think global warming will pose a serious threat to them or their way of life in their lifetime. In 2004, about 34 percent answered yes. That rose to 40 percent in 2008, then fell to a low of 32 percent in 2010. It then rose to 38 percent and slid a bit to 36 percent where it stands today. When you account for the margin of error, public opinion has yo-yoed a bit but hasn’t changed all that much. Gallup finds that few American list climate change as a top concern. It ranked near the bottom out of 15 issues polled. Asked how much they worry, 51 percent said little or not at all about climate change, compared to just 11 percent who said they were unconcerned about the economy. Are humans causing it? In 2006, Pew found that 41 percent of public thought the Earth was getting warmer mainly due to human activity such as burning fossil fuels. In keeping with the pattern we saw for other questions, that number dropped to 34 percent in 2010, and then rose to 44 percent by the end of 2013. On this point, the partisan divide is pronounced. Just 24 percent of Republicans thought humans were driving climate change, compared to 43 percent of independents and 66 percent of Democrats. The Gallup polls show a similar pattern. In 2004, 61 percent thought humans were making the planet warmer. That fell to 50 percent in 2010, followed by a rise to 57 percent today. Again, the polling shows a slight decline in public buy-in on climate change since 2004, but it has risen from a low point a few years ago. Our ruling Scarborough said Americans have ""have wandered away"" from the issue of climate change since 2004. They certainly did, as polls consistently show dips through 2010. However, support has inched back in recent years.  While the recent gains remain below the 2004 levels, the overall drop isn't as dramatic as Scarborough makes it sound",Half True,"May 13, 2014"
"The National Science Foundation awarded $700,000 to fund a climate change musical.","Republican U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, whose district stretches from San Antonio north into Austin, recently pressed an official about the government bankrolling a musical. Smith, chairman of the House Science, Space & Technology Committee, listed six National Science Foundation grants as questionable--including, Smith said at the panel’s March 26, 2014, hearing, a ""climate change musical that was prepared for Broadway but I’m not sure ever was actually produced, $700,000."" Smith then asked John Holdren, the White House science czar, if the foundation should justify such grants to the public, whose tax dollars fund them, the Texan reminded. Holdren replied that the foundation, which is entrusted with promoting scientific progress, already justifies its grants in online posts. ""We’re going to have to agree to disagree,"" Smith said. We’ve noted the scientific consensus globally that the Earth is warming. We focused for this article on whether the foundation ponied up for a play about that. Grant confirmed To our inquiry, a foundation spokeswoman, Dana Topousis, said by email the grant was awarded in 2010, adding: ""The Civilians, Inc., a Brooklyn, N.Y., theatre company, developed an innovative, out-of-the-box approach to exposing U.S. citizens to science. The project represents the unique cultural leverage of theater in its attempt to inspire the public’s imagination and curiosity about basic science and its relation to their everyday lives."" Topousis continued: ""This venture, like other more traditional NSF-funded informal science education projects (e.g., interactive science exhibits, IMAX films, science-based television programming), aims to educate through a focus on understanding the scientific method, its applications, and its unique ability to extract knowledge about our complex natural world. It presents the pursuit of fundamental knowledge through basic research in a neutral manner that does not advocate any position regarding climate change or conservation research,"" she said. A foundation summary of the grant award, brought to our attention by Topousis and Zach Kurz, staff spokesman for the Republican side of Smith’s committee, states that a grant totaling $697,177 was awarded in 2010 covering August 2010 through July 2014. Play description The summary describes ""The Great Immensity"" as a ""touring play with songs and video that explores our relationship to the environment, with a focus on critical issues of climate change and biodiversity conservation."" ""The play has been created with a network of partners including the Princeton Environmental Institute and Princeton Atelier Program/Lewis Arts Center, which will maintain an ongoing relationship with the project,"" the summary says, continuing: ""The play uses real places and stories drawn from interviews conducted by the artists to create an experience that is part investigative journalism and part inventive theater. Attendance at the performances is projected to be about 75,000."" The summary also says: ""A major goal of the project is to help the public better appreciate how science studies the Earth's biosphere and to promote an inquisitive curiosity about our place in the natural world. The initiative also intends to create and evaluate a new model for how theater can increase public awareness, knowledge, and engagement with important science-related societal issues."" Also, the summary says, the project will lead to the ""development and testing of online content, podcasts, and videos as well as special community education and outreach efforts in each community where the play is staged. Performances will be accompanied by post-performance panel discussions with the artists, local scientists and policy makers. After the completion of the initial tour, the play will be published, licensed, and made available to other theaters to produce independently."" Tickets on sale By phone, Sarah Benvenuti, an administrator for the Civilian Theater Co., said the play is slated to run April 11-May 1, 2014, at the Public Theater’s Martinson Hall in New York, which is not on Broadway. Tickets will be $20 each, she said. Benvenuti said the play is about climate change and includes musical numbers, which one can view in online videos. ""Margin of Error,"" for instance, shows cast members singing about poll results. (Really.) We wondered if the presentation is explicit, say, about human contributions to warming. Benevenuti didn’t say, though she stressed that the play draws on direct conversations with expert scientists. ""Climate change is a real thing,"" she said. ""We have to do something about it."" The script is not published, she said, but she pointed out the Public Theater’s online description of the play as a ""continent-hopping thriller following a woman, Phyllis, as she pursues her husband Karl who disappeared from a tropical island while on an assignment for a nature show. Through her search,"" the summary says, ""Phyllis uncovers a mysterious plot surrounding the upcoming international climate summit in Paris. As the days count down to the summit, Phyllis must decipher the plan and possibly stop it in time.

Finally, we circled back to the foundation to ask if the musical was an unusual grant beneficiary. Topousis replied by email that while the NSF ""research portfolio this falls under--Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL)--contains projects at the intersection of science and the arts, NSF’s funding this kind of project--a theatrical production--is rare.""

"""There are over 100 pipelines between the United States and Canada right now.""","Former Gov. Jeb Bush says the Keystone XL Pipeline is a ""no-brainer."" Bush took a question on the pipeline after a speech to the business and civic group Broward Workshop. AutoNation CEO Mike Jackson asked him this: ""Just as a symbol -- as a symbol -- would you have approved something like the Keystone Pipeline or would you have studied it for eight years?"" Bush responded: ""I read something that was quite interesting. There are over 100 pipelines between the United States and Canada right now. Give me a break. What are we arguing about here?"" We’re not going to weigh in on the pros and cons of expanding the pipeline but we can fact-check whether there are already 100 pipelines between the United States and Canada. Keystone Pipeline Keystone XL is a proposed pipeline that would carry 830,000 barrels per day of diluted oil sands from Western Canada to Nebraska and then to refineries on the Gulf Coast. Earlier in March, the U.S. State Department concluded the public comment period about the project. After six years of contentious debate between environmentalists and pipeline supporters, the decision now lies with President Barack Obama. We sent Bush’s claim to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which referred us to an October 2013 Congressional Research Service report. The report stated that CRS ""has identified over 100 operating or proposed oil, natural gas, and electric transmission facilities crossing the U.S.-Mexico or U.S.-Canada border."" A Bush spokesperson later referred us to this report as well. Bush had said there were over ""100 pipelines between the United States and Canada right now,"" but the CRS report refers to operating and proposed facilities crossing the border with Canada or Mexico. With help from FERC and the Pipeline Safety Trust, a safety watchdog group, we counted the pipelines in the tables of the report and found 29 natural gas pipelines crossing the U.S.-Canada border and about 17 oil pipelines crossing the U.S.-Canada border. Philippe Reicher, a spokesman for the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association, told PolitiFact that the National Energy Board, which regulates pipelines crossing the border between Canada and the United States, has indicated that they have approximately 80 pipelines crossing the border. ""That would include oil, gas, water, etc.,"" he wrote in an email. ""In terms of large transmission pipeline systems similar to the proposed Keystone XL, we are probably looking between 18 and 22."" Lorne Stockman, research director at Oil Change International, a group that opposes Keystone, pointed to a map from the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, which shows all the existing and proposed liquids pipelines crossing the border.   ""Some of these carry products rather than crude, and only a handful currently carry tar sands crude,"" Stockman told PolitiFact. ""Looks quite busy on this map, but I think we can all agree that  100 is a little overstated."" Our ruling Bush said, ""There are over 100 pipelines between the United States and Canada right now."" Bush has a point that there are a number of major oil and gas pipelines that already cross the U.S.-Canada border. But his number is significantly off. A 2013 Congressional Research Service report referred to 100 pipelines, but that included operating or proposed oil, natural gas, and electric transmission lines, and it counted pipelines crossing both the U.S.-Mexico border and the U.S.-Canada border. If we only count operating pipelines that cross the Canadian border, we count 29 natural gas pipelines and 17 oil pipelines, for a total of 46",Mostly False,"March 26, 2014"
"Earth ""has not warmed for the last 17 years.""","Fox News pundit Sean Hannity set the stage for a screaming match on climate change when he invited liberal Bob Beckel of The Five to debate Patrick Moore, a former Greenpeace activist who says there is no proof man is contributing to a warming planet. Beckel criticized Moore for his work as a spokesman for the nuclear energy industry and for saying carbon emissions go back into trees and food rather than the atmosphere. ""Come on, Patrick. You know better than that,"" Beckel said during the March 11 edition of Hannity. But Moore said cries about climate change are actually just about fits of weather. ""Basically, they're just saying weather these days,"" Moore said. ""They're saying the weather is climate change, but that's not true. Weather is just weather, like the cold weather we're getting this year. It has not warmed for the last 17 years. We know that for sure. And that brings into question the whole hypothesis."" PunditFact wanted to know if the Earth has not warmed for the last 17 years, and what it means if anything for the theory of climate change. We found clues, and seeming contradictions to his claim, in the PolitiFact archive. Lately it’s been hot a lot President Barack Obama warned the nation there will be consequences from not doing more to combat climate change in his 2013 State of the Union address, pointing out ""the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15."" PolitiFact rated his statement True. (Actually it’s 13 or 14 of the last 15.) But that doesn’t necessarily rule out Moore’s claim about the earth not getting warmer lately. The statements can co-exist, with some additional context. Moore’s claim is a popular argument of people who say climate change isn’t real. The problem is it is cherry-picked and leaves out the rest of the story about earth’s dramatic temperature increases over the last century. NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies tracks global land-ocean temperatures using a temperature index. 
 (The index shows the temperature anomaly of each year. The temperature anomaly shows how a year's land-ocean temperatures compares with the longterm average. A higher anomaly, such as 0.67 degrees Celsius in 2010, shows how much warmer a year was than the longterm average. A negative anomaly, last seen in 1976, indicates a cooler year than the referenced period.) As you can see, Earth’s land-ocean temperatures escalated starting in the 1970s, setting off a new era of rising sea levels, increased greenhouse gas emissions and melting sea ice. Temperatures spiked about 17 years ago in 1998, an outlier year that involved a strong El Niño with abnormally warm ocean temperatures. Since then, temperatures have remained relatively, but not entirely flat. That’s the basis for Moore’s claim. There are several problems with his analysis, however. Data for 2014 isn’t available yet. So really there are only 16 data points (years) between 1998 and 2014. If you include 1997 to the analysis, Moore is clearly wrong. The years 2005 and 2010 were both warmer than 1998, though only slightly. That also makes Moore’s statement technically inaccurate, though most scientists agree that temperatures have remained relatively flat recently. Moore cherry-picked a year when temperatures spiked. ""What was an extraordinary event in 1998 is now the new normal,"" said Goddard Institute program analyst Reto Ruedy, program manager at NASA’s Goddard Institute. Moore would be incorrect if he chose 1999, 1997, 1996 or any year before that. ""If you start with an extremely warm year, the warming trend going forward is going to be mostly flat,"" said Gordon Hamilton, associate research professor at the Climate Change Institute at the University of Maine. ""You could easily choose 1999 and 1996 and you would find that there’s an upward trend,"" said  Kevin Trenberth, a distinguished senior scientist in the climate analysis section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. ""It’s cherry-picking to get the result that he apparently desires."" Moore’s response While Moore used the 17-year-statistic on Hannity to make the argument that climate change isn’t happening, he told us the figure ""does not prove much."" Moore said NOAA and NASA recordkeeping only go back 150 years and the planet’s temperature has fluctuated over the course of time. It is cooler now than for ""most of life history,"" he said. ""It is a pause, flat, whatever you want to call it, for 17 years,"" Moore said. Hamilton and Ruedy dismissed Moore’s qualms, saying the 150-year record is reliable to determine statistically significant trends. For pre-19th century estimates, scientists use other methods, such as tree rings and ice core bubbles, to detect climate trends, Ruedy said. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group operating under the United Nations that reviews climate change research, has concluded the warming of the climate is ""unprecedented over decades to millennia."" Moore’s Greenpeace ties A final note about Moore. In his interview on Hannity and in many other places, Moore has been described as a ""founder"" of Greenpeace. The organization, however, disputes that. Greenpeace devotes a webpage to explaining Moore’s lack of credentials, though they agree he was involved in the group’s early days. The group was founded in 1970 as the Don’t Make a Wave Committee with the goal of stopping an American nuclear weapons test on Amchitka Island in the Aleutians. Moore, a college student, wrote a letter to the group in 1971 asking to join the crew of activists sailing to protest the nuclear test. Moore was one of three Greenpeace members on board the Phyllis Cormack, which carried a dozen passengers to Amchitka Island for the protest. Greenpeace says the group’s founders include seven people, but not Moore. Greenpeace leaders voted Moore out of his positions as director of Greenpeace Canada and one of five directors of Greenpeace International, and Moore left in 1986, said Greenpeace spokesman David Pomerantz. He served as a consultant and co-chairman of the nuclear industry-funded Clean and Safe Energy Coalition until he retired from it in 2013. Our ruling Moore said the whole theory of climate change is called into question because ""it has not warmed for the last 17 years."" It’s true that global surface temperatures have remained relatively flat for 17 years, since 1998. However, both 2005 and 2010 were warmer than 1998. Moore’s statement alone ignores that the first decade of the 21st century was the warmest on record. And Moore is cherry-picking a timeframe to support his argument by starting at an extremely warm year. Global surface temperatures have risen, for instance, if you started at 1999, 1996, or any year before that. Moore’s statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression",Mostly False,"March 17, 2014"
"Says ""Bill Clinton and George Bush both say build the Keystone XL.""","March 7 is the last day the U.S. Department of State will hear public comments on Keystone XL, a proposed pipeline that would carry diluted oil sands from Western Canada to Nebraska and then to refineries on the Gulf Coast. With the closing of the 30-day comment period, six years of contentious debate between environmentalists and pipeline supporters is expected to come to a head when President Barack Obama makes a final decision on whether to proceed. In an attempt to sway public opinion, the American Petroleum Institute relaunched an ad campaign backing the pipeline. The 30-second spot, which is airing in the District of Columbia, Montana, New Mexico and North Carolina, claims that in the land of deadlock, the pipeline is one of few projects to win support from both sides of the spectrum. ""Washington. It’s gridlock, division, bitter partisanship,"" the ad says. ""But one jobs plan brings both sides together. Bill Clinton and George (W.) Bush both say build the Keystone XL."" A ringing endorsement of the Keystone pipeline from 42 and 43? That sounds like something worth looking into. Bush backs it The American Petroleum Institute ad clearly identifies sources backing up their claim for viewers. For Bush, the ad references an article from Bloomberg published in March 2012, in which the former Republican president calls the pipeline ""a no-brainer,"" according to the report. ""The clear goal ought to be how to get the private sector to grow,"" Bush said. ""If you say that, then an issue like the Keystone pipeline becomes an easy issue."" We weren’t surprised Bush supports the plan. Republicans have been overwhelmingly supportive of the proposal and Bush has ties to the oil industry. Heck, he made the aforementioned remarks during the keynote speech of the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers conference. But what about Clinton? Clinton’s backing of Keystone did cause us to raise an eyebrow. The ad points to a Feb. 29, 2012, article from Politico. In it, Clinton calls for Americans to ""embrace"" the pipeline. We tracked down the original speech. It was given at the 2012 ARPA-E Energy Innovation Summit, a conference held by the U.S. Department of Energy. Here’s what Clinton had to say: ""One of the most amazing things to me about this Keystone Pipeline deal is that they ever filed that route in the first place since they could've gone around the Nebraska Sandhills and avoided most of the danger, no matter how imagined, to the Ogallala (aquifer) with a different route, which I presume we'll get now, because the extra cost of running it is infinitesimal compared to the revenues that will be generated over a long period of time. ""So, I think we should embrace it and develop a stakeholder-driven system of high standards for doing the work modeled on what was done with auto mileage agreement."" Clinton’s remarks are somewhat hard to follow. But he seems to say that Americans should ""embrace"" the Keystone pipeline and the government should work with the oil industry and environmentalists to develop standards for implementing and overseeing the project, similar to how all the stakeholders got together to develop higher standards for gas mileage in new vehicles. That’s how media reports characterized his comments, and Clinton made no attempt to correct them in the two years since. Within a year, Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman approved a new route for the pipeline that largely avoided the Nebraska Sandhills, as Clinton predicted. If he was not placated by the route change, Clinton never said so publicly. In fact, we couldn’t find any more public statements by Clinton regarding the Keystone XL pipeline. Several environmental groups we contacted said they had no recollection of Clinton speaking on the issue since 2012. We reached out to Clinton through the Clinton Global Initiative to see if his position had changed or could be affirmed for us. We didn’t hear back. Putting Clinton’s speech in context So we’re left with one public comment made two years ago. But we can deduce a few things based off what he said. First, in his remarks, Clinton was largely endorsing an all-of-the-above energy approach that focused on greener and sustainable methods. And while he expressed support for the Keystone project, he also said that tapping into homegrown natural resources was not a panacea. ""There are some hazards to the innovation project, right now,"" Clinton said. ""We have massive new recovery technologies in oil and gas which could lead us down the primrose path of thinking we don't have to keep using less energy and developing clean energy and technologies."" But Clinton’s call to ""embrace"" the pipeline also came as the U.S. State Department was deciding whether to recommend the project’s approval. The State Department, at that time, was headed by his wife. Indeed, not hours after Clinton gave his speech in 2012, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was testifying before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, where she fielded questions about the State Department’s oversight of the pipeline proposal. In the hearing, Secretary Clinton was even asked about her husband’s comments from earlier that day. Rep. Connie Mack, R-Fla., noted, ""Even the former President, Bill Clinton, says, ‘Embrace it and we need to move forward with the Keystone XL pipeline.’ "" Clinton respond, ""He is a very smart man,"" inciting laughter. She then added, ""But unfortunately he is not bound by the laws and regulations and longer of the United States to make decisions that follow a certain procedure. And that is what we have to do."" ""So is it a mistake for the former president to say, ‘embrace it’?"" Mack then asked. ""Of course not,"" Clinton replied. ""This is America. People say they embrace it, people say they hate it. Our job is to take a very clear-eyed look at what the facts are."" So not only did Bill Clinton come out in favor of the pipeline in 2012, he did so during a public speech hosted by the U.S. Energy Department just hours before his wife, who oversaw the administration’s review of the pipeline, was set to testify in front of a Republican-controlled House committee. For her part, Hillary Clinton has gone back and forth on the pipeline. In 2010 she said she was ""inclined"" to approve the project. But under her command, the State Department also recommended Obama deny approval of the pipeline in 2012 after congressional Republicans forced a decision from the White House within 60 days. At the time, Clinton said the window was too short to review the environmental impact of the project. Our ruling The American Petroleum Institute ad says, ""Bill Clinton and George Bush both say build the Keystone XL"" pipeline. While their evidence is two years old, it’s not fabricated. Since voicing support of the pipeline in 2012, Clinton has not publicly weighed in on the controversy. But his backing of the project was not an offhand comment. It came during a publicized energy speech on the same day his wife was testifying before Congress. It seems unlikely he would endorse the proposal on such an occasion if he did not mean it",True,"March 5, 2014"
"As a result of climate change, ice fishermen in Wisconsin ""are already noticing fewer days they can be out on our ice covered lakes.""","Severe cold snaps followed by snowstorms and then another blast of cold. For many, this Wisconsin winter can’t end soon enough. So when U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, took to the floor of the House of Representatives on Jan. 16, 2014, a speech about global warming was the last thing many folks wanted to hear. Pocan, a member of the House’s Safe Climate Caucus, spent his one-minute speech ticking off what he said were clear signs of climate change. This claim caught our attention: ""Ice fishermen are already noticing fewer days they can be out on our ice covered lakes."" It feels like Wisconsin has been frozen solid for months, and many folks wouldn’t be surprised to see ice fishermen tromping around on Memorial Day. But Pocan’s claim is about more than this winter. His statement is about long-term trends and what is driving them. Is he right about climate change and fewer days on ice-covered lakes? When we asked Pocan for backup for the claim, his staff pointed us to Climatewisconsin.org, a web site that highlights research and reports prepared by environmental groups. The site includes interactive features that focus on the two largest lakes in Madison -- Mendota and Monona. It includes the amount of time they have been covered by ice in past years. ""The records show significant year-to-year variability in the length of the ice-cover season, but there is a clear trend of fewer ice-cover days over time,"" the site says. ""Overall, the average number of days of ice cover on the Madison lakes has decreased by around 29-35 days over the past 150 years. Significantly, the longest ice seasons on record are all clustered in the first few years of the record, while most of the shortest seasons fall towards the end of the record."" The site also includes this statement, which is pretty similar to that made by Pocan: ""With climate change models predicting warmer temperatures, we can expect to see a trend towards fewer days of ice-covered lakes as each year passes. In fact, with the aid of a remarkable dataset from Madison’s lakes, scientists infer that a change in ice duration has already taken place."" Information posted on the site comes, at least in part, from the work of John J. Magnuson, Emeritus Professor of Zoology and Limnology, who has been at UW since the late 1960s and helped found the UW-Madison Center for Limnology in the early 1980s. Limnology is the study of freshwater lakes, and the UW center says it’s the birthplace of the field of study, dating back to the 1870s. Magnuson is an expert on the effects of climate change on freshwater lakes, and has published numerous academic papers on the effect of climate change on lakes and fish. In an interview, Magnuson said researchers around the world, including Canada, Finland, Sweden, Russia, Japan and Madison, have studied lake ice for years. Researchers note the day lakes freeze and the day the ice goes out. It’s a more official version of what is waged in a less academic way by lakefront bars that stage ice-out guessing contests. Madison researchers have records for Mendota and Monona that go back to 1855. The long term trend for Lake Mendota is that, on average since 1855, there are 29 fewer days that the lake is covered with ice, according to Magnuson. Six of the shortest seasons for Mendota have been in the years since 1980. Five have been since 1995, including the two shortest seasons ever -- 21 days in the winter of 2001-02 and 47 days in 1997-98. Lake Monona has seen on average of 35 fewer ice-covered days, and also has seen a cluster of shorter seasons in recent years. ""The breakup of the ice is occurring, on average, two weeks earlier. And the freezing of the lakes have come two weeks later, on average,"" Magnuson said. ""The result is that four months of ice is reduced to about three months."" To be sure, Wisconsin has some 15,000 lakes, and we cannot check each one. ""This is highly variable with every water body having different characteristics, and is obviously very weather dependent as well,"" said Thomas Van Haren, of the state Department of Natural Resources Bureau of Law Enforcement. But it seems reasonable to focus on Lake Monona and Mendota given their size and because they are in Pocan’s district. So what about this throwback winter? Magnuson said it’s a statistical blip. Some years the ice stays around longer than others, but over time the trend has been toward shorter ice seasons. ""The variability is very high"" in terms of the length of the seasons, he said. ""Not only does lake ice respond to the warming climate, it also responds to local weather."" Lake Mendota iced over Dec. 16, 2013 -- about a month earlier than the previous year and four days earlier than the median date. Lake Monona froze Dec. 10, 2013, compared with Dec. 31 the previous year and a median date of Dec. 15. National Weather Service records from the weather office in Sullivan indicate this was the 9th coldest winter on record, so far, in Madison, and the coldest in 35 years. The average temperature was 15.8 degrees below normal. ""This is the sort of winter that’s typical of 50 or 100 years ago,"" Magnuson said. Going global So what about the connection Pocan made between shorter ice fishing seasons and climate change? Magnuson said the shorter seasons are a symptom of global warming -- one consistent with many others, such as changed bird and butterfly migration patterns, plants that bloom earlier, and disappearing glaciers. ""We can’t take this ice data and say ‘therefore we say greenhouse gas is causing this,’"" he said. ""That’s a question for the atmospheric physicists. Our data is consistent with what other people are finding, with the kind of things that atmospheric scientists are seeing from C02."" He added: ""There’s abundant evidence that it’s getting warmer and that spring is coming sooner."" Unfortunately, he’s talking about long-term trends. Not what is going to happen this year. Our rating It’s been a longer and colder winter than in recent years. But that doesn’t erase a trend that’s been well-established. The number of days that the lakes have ice on them -- making them safe for ice fishing -- has declined",True,"February 17, 2014"
"""The Republican leadership in the House has refused to address the issues that matter the most to Rhode Island, such as passing a jobs bill.""","In this era of high unemployment, it's always about jobs. The issue came up again Jan. 31 when Jonathan Boucher, executive director of the Rhode Island Democratic Party, published a commentary in The Providence Journal attacking the argument by Republican Ian Prior that the state needs Republicans in its congressional delegation, now all Democratic. Boucher argued that the idea of ""replacing our delegation with a bunch of Republican freshmen,"" which wasn't exactly Prior's argument, ""is completely absurd."" ""The House Republicans’ failure and inability to govern caused the first government shutdown in 16 years. The Republican leadership in the House has refused to address the issues that matter the most to Rhode Island, such as passing a jobs bill, extending unemployment benefits, raising the minimum wage, and passing comprehensive immigration reform."" In that list of alleged GOP failures, one stood out to a reader, who emailed us a list of jobs bills that, he said, the Republican-controlled House has, in fact, passed. We were intrigued and decided to see whether Boucher's jobs claim was correct. The list has lots of bills with the word ""jobs"" in the title, but that doesn't mean the proposals would actually create jobs. In addition, Republicans and Democrats tend to have different views on what constitutes a ""jobs bill."" For Democrats, that can mean legislation expanding or creating a government training program. For Republicans, that can mean bills shrinking government or eliminating regulations to help businesses. We decided to use a technique employed by PolitiFact National when it looked at a claim made on Facebook in 2011 that congressional Republicans have introduced dozens of bills on social issues and other topics, but ""zero on job creation,"" a claim that earned a Pants on Fire. We went to Congress.gov, run by the Library of Congress. It lists the topics that a bill covers. We looked for topics related to employment and job creation. It's not a perfect gauge, but it's a nonpartisan guide. We also reviewed summaries of the bills and committee reports looking for references to jobs and employment. For example, the SKILLS Act (H.R. 803), intended to streamline work-force development programs, touches on 52 topics from ""tobacco use"" to ""sex offenses."" But it also has provisions that deal with ""labor and employment,"" ""unemployment,"" ""temporary and part-time employment,"" ""vocational education"" and ""youth employment and child labor."" It passed the House on March 15, 2013. The ""Veterans Economic Opportunity Act of 2013"" (H.R. 2481) deals with veterans education, employment and rehabilitation. It passed the House on a voice vote on Oct. 28, 2013. And the ""Global Investment in American Jobs Act of 2013"" (H.R. 2052) is intended to get the feds to come up with a plan for increasing ""U.S. global competitiveness without weakening labor, consumer, financial, or environmental protections."" It passed the House in a bipartisan vote on Sept. 9, 2013. Some jobs bills were designed to create jobs by encouraging more energy production and distribution, such as proposals to expand offshore oil drilling or push the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which gives some environmentalists heartburn. Others on the list from our GOP reader seemed to have little to do with directly promoting employment, and Congress.gov doesn't list them in any employment-related categories. When we emailed the list of ""jobs"" legislation to Boucher, he took issue with some of the bills, saying they weren’t really about jobs. Boucher also argued that his statement is true because none of the Republican jobs-related legislation had been enacted. ""When I wrote 'passing a jobs bill,' I was clearly referring to a bill that has passed into law,"" he said in an email statement. ""A bill can’t create a single job if it’s not actually passed into law."" But that's not what he said in his commentary. He said, ""The Republican leadership in the House has refused to address the issues that matter the most to Rhode Island, such as passing a jobs bill."" The House, regardless of which party is in control, cannot unilaterally enact laws. Approval by the Senate and (in most cases) the president are also required. The bottom line: The House, under the current Republican leadership, has passed bills with the goal of encouraging employment. Whether one thinks that the bills will do more harm than good is a matter for debate, and beyond the scope of this fact check",False,"February 16, 2014"
"A government report shows that alternatives to the Keystone XL pipeline ""are worse"" for the environment.","Republicans are rejoicing over a new government report about one of the biggest controversies of the day. Nope, not Obamacare, but good guess. It’s on the Keystone XL pipeline. As liberal CNN Crossfire host Van Jones argued against President Barack Obama approving the project in a recent show, conservative activist Ralph Reed said a U.S. State Department study clears the air about the project’s long-term effect on the environment. (We rated Jones’ statement about the project creating 35 permanent jobs True.) ""What the report shows, Van -- and this is irrefutable; the science is clear -- is that the alternatives to the pipeline are worse,"" he said. ""If you use primarily tanker trucks to transport this shale gas, climate emissions will be 28 percent higher than the pipeline. If you use primarily rail, they'll be 40 to 42 percent higher."" ""So if you're protecting the environment, you should build the pipeline."" We wanted to check out his claim that the pipeline is better in terms of fewer climate emissions than the alternatives, including doing nothing. Read this if you’re kind of late to Keystone  The proposed Keystone XL pipeline would stretch from Western Canada to Steele City, Neb., ushering 830,000 barrels of heavy, diluted Canadian tar sands per day to refineries on the Gulf Coast with help of existing pipelines. TransCanada’s project crosses international borders, so the company had to file an application for a presidential permit. As part of the process, the president directs the Secretary of State to determine whether the project ""serves the national interest."" Secretary of State John Kerry has not yet issued his recommendation. The issue splits environmentalists and labor unions, putting Kerry and Obama under unusual pressure from a divided Democratic Party. Republicans and labor unions tout the pipeline’s construction jobs, reduced dependence on oil from other continents and continued friendliness with Canada, while environmentalists want Obama to send a strong message about climate change. Back in June, Obama said the country’s national interest ""will be served only if this project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution."" Many headlines about an 11-volume State Department report about the pipeline’s environmental impact focused on its finding that the pipeline project would not significantly contribute to carbon pollution, which some see as giving Obama an opening for approval. That does not mean the project is without impact. The report examined the greenhouse gas effect of the project, finding that the emissions primarily from electricity use to power pump stations, fuel for vehicles and vented or leaked methane would be comparable to about 300,000 cars operating per year, or more than 70,000 homes using electricity for one year. An important thread in the debate is an assurance from Canadian officials and oil producers that oil will reach the American marketplace even if the pipeline is not built. So the State Department compared the environmental impact of other methods of moving the oil south from Canada. What could happen without the pipeline?  Producing crude oil from oil sands is complicated. The sands are comprised of clay, sand, water and a substance called bitumen, a thick, soft asphalt-like material that is too dense to traverse pipelines on its own. It is diluted with lighter substances and heated to make it easier to move, resembling more of a heavy crude oil called dilbut. The process is energy-intensive, and the transportable material is corrosive and difficult to clean up, opponents say. By law, the department had to consider the environmental impact of reasonable alternatives to the pipeline. The State Department investigated three alternative transportation methods: If you had a hard time visualizing how all of that would work, consult the State Department’s map laying it out (or read the 100-page description). Our focus is on how these alternatives affect carbon emissions. We modified a chart in the State Department report for annual greenhouse gas emissions from crude transport from Alberta, Canada, to the Gulf Coast. (MTCO2e = Metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents) Proposed Keystone XL pipeline Rail/pipeline scenario Rail/tanker scenario All rail to coast scenario MTCO2e/Year per 830,000 barrels per day 3,123,859 4,428,902 4,363,611 3,991,472 MTCO2e/Year per 100,000 barrels per day 376,369 533,603 525,857 480,900 Percentage difference from proposed Keystone n/a 41.8 percent 39.7 percent 27.8 percent   Reed’s numbers for carbon emissions from the alternative scenarios pretty much align with the report, but he mixed them up. He said, ""If you use primarily tanker trucks to transport this shale gas, climate emissions will be 28 percent higher than the pipeline. If you use primarily rail, they'll be 40 to 42 percent higher."" In reality, using primarily rail raises carbon levels 28 percent more than the pipeline and using primarily tankers raises carbon levels 40 percent, the report said. Reed also said tanker trucks, when the report is actually speaking of tanker ships. Using a combination of rail and existing pipeline would yield 42 percent more carbon emissions. Not exactly a clean bill of health Reed is broadly onto something with the report, but environmental activists criticized his statement, saying the science on the climate safety of shale oil is hardly clear. Reed’s statement dismisses the fact that the project would generate more greenhouse gases than the alternative desired by environmentalists: doing nothing to expand tar sands production. ""It’s all worse"" for the environment than doing nothing, said Eddie Scher, a spokesman for the Sierra Club. ""The argument here is that crack is somehow worse than heroin. We think that you should do neither."" Extracting oil from tar sands is more ""carbon intensive"" than other crude oil. It’s 13 percent more carbon intensive than other heavy crudes and 17 percent more than the average barrel of crude oil refined in the U.S. in 2005. If Keystone XL is rejected, ""tar sands expansion will slow,"" said Anthony Swift, National Resources Defense Council international program attorney. Even the Environmental Protection Agency raised concerns with the State Department about the possibility of tar sands being easily shipped by rail instead of the pipeline. In April, the EPA argued in response to a State draft environmental assessment that the department should improve its energy-economic modeling strategy and dig in deeper to rail capacity and costs. Basically, their assumptions are too rosy, EPA says. Our ruling Reed said the State Department report shows ""the science is clear"" that ""alternatives to the pipeline are worse,"" pointing to higher emissions from alternate transportation options of tanker trucks and rail. Reed didn’t pull the numbers out of anywhere, although he did mess them up a bit, for instance by saying ""tanker trucks"" instead of sea ""tankers"" described in one of the report’s alternative scenarios. As to his general point that the pipeline option is better in terms of CO2 emissions than projections for other options, yes, those alternatives are worse. But besides getting his numbers crossed, he was also a bit clumsy in describing ""alternatives"" and saying that if ""you're protecting the environment, you should build the pipeline."" Reed assumes that the pipeline should be built, but environmentalists say the best alternative for the environment would be to do nothing and slow tar sands production.

"""Only 3 percent of voters 18 to 34 don't believe that climate change is really happening.""","More than a dozen Senate Democrats called a news conference on Jan. 14, 2014, to draw attention to their efforts to curb climate change. One of those senators -- Chris Murphy, D-Conn. -- focused his remarks on the impact of public opinion on advancing an agenda on climate-change policy. Murphy said that advocates for policies to address climate-change ""have to convince Republicans -- and those who would stand against the action that we're proposing -- of the electoral consequences of continuing to ignore this issue. We have to tell Republicans that if they ultimately want to stop the hemorrhaging from young voters in this country, they need to start paying attention to this issue, because only 3 percent of voters 18 to 34 don't believe that climate change is really happening."" We wondered whether Murphy’s polling data was sound. Thanks to some previous reporting by our colleagues at PolitiFact Rhode Island, we quickly found a poll that appears to be the source for Murphy’s claim. It was commissioned by the League of Conservation Voters, an environmental group, and conducted by a polling team that included one Democratic firm and one Republican firm. The poll was taken between July 8 and July 10, 2013, with 600 respondents, all of whom were registered voters between 18 and 34 who voted in the 2012 general election. The poll asked, ""Which of the following best describes your view of climate change?"" Here are the responses: • Climate change is a severe threat that we must start addressing now: 55 percent • Climate change is an issue to address in the years ahead, but it's not urgent now: 11 percent • Climate change may be happening, but it's a natural event that humans can't affect: 27 percent • Climate change is not really happening: 3 percent • Don't know: 3 percent This appears to support Murphy’s claim. We should note a few quibbles. • The poll was paid for by an environmental group. We always believe it’s worth noting whenever someone cites a poll paid for by a group with a perspective and a stake in the issue. However, the fact that two polling firms, one from each party, were included makes the poll somewhat more credible. • On a subsequent question in the same poll -- ""When, if ever, will the consequences of climate change personally affect people like you?"" -- the number answering ""never"" was 6 percent. That’s higher than 3 percent, though both are small percentages in the larger scheme of things. • There’s one other poll that asks a similar question and finds different results. But they aren’t exactly comparable. The Pew Research Center -- an independent polling organization -- surveyed a national sample of 1,504 adults age 18 or older between Oct. 9 and Oct. 13, 2013. One of the questions Pew asked was: ""From what you’ve read and heard, is there solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades, or not?"" Among 18- to 29-year-olds, 73 percent said the earth is warming, and 18 percent said it was not warming -- quite a bit higher than the 3 percent from the other poll. The two polls use different age ranges, but if respondents up to age 34 were added in, that would likely increase the percentage of global-warming deniers further, since an even higher percentage of 30- to 49-year olds said there was no global warming -- 28 percent. Why such divergent responses? One factor could be the precise wording of each poll. But a bigger difference is likely the pool of respondents. The LCV poll only counted answers from ""registered voters … who voted in the 2012 general election,"" while the Pew poll simply asked ""adults."" This means the poll results aren’t comparable in an apples-to-apples fashion. This difference might have posed a problem for Murphy, but he was careful with how he worded his claim. He said ""3 percent of voters"" -- not ""3 percent of Americans."" So we don’t find fault on these grounds. ""Pollsters don’t ask about climate change very often,"" said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""Most polls show that most people believe global warming is real. The question for policy makers is what kind of priority it should be, and here, many pollsters show it not to be very high."" Our ruling Murphy said, ""Only 3 percent of voters 18 to 34 don't believe that climate change is really happening."" It should be noted that Murphy cited a poll that had been paid for by an environmental group. Still, we couldn’t find any poll with genuinely comparable data that clashed with Murphy’s carefully worded assertion",True,"January 15, 2014"

""We are having a record-breaking cold snap in many parts of the country,"" he said during his Jan. 6 show. ""And right on schedule the media have to come up with a way to make it sound like it’s completely unprecedented. Because they’ve got to find a way to attach this to the global warming agenda, and they have. It’s called the ‘polar vortex.’ The dreaded polar vortex."" ""Do you know what the polar vortex is? Have you ever heard of it? Well, they just created it for this week."" Here’s part of how he broke it down for his audience: ""See, normally the polar vortex stays up there in the polar region, but something is causing it to dip down like it's never happened before. We've never had arctic air blasts before. And remember, now, the key to all this is you have to understand one of the fundamental concepts of man-made global warming is ice melting at the poles. ""One of the ways they have always sought to convince you that the world is warming is not the climate where you live, but rather where you aren't, where you can't see what is really happening. So they tell you the ice is melting at the North Pole and the South Pole. And then they publish pictures, which are fraudulent pictures, of poor little polar bears stranded on three square feet of ice that you are told used to be the North Pole. ""... Well, obviously there is no melting of ice going on at the North Pole. If they're gonna tell us the polar vortex is responsible for this cold, that means record cold is also happening in the North Pole, which means there isn't any ice melting."" We’ve heard several political commentators, errantly, call into question the validity of global warming given the week’s record-breaking low temperatures. Limbaugh takes it further, dubious of both global warming and the polar vortex itself. PunditFact wanted to know: Does the unusual blast of cool air, which he says the media ginned up as the ""dreaded polar vortex,"" disprove global warming? ""Polar vortex"" may sound new to Limbaugh, journalists and anyone who is not a weather expert, but it’s not a term the media cooked up to scare you. It’s been part of the conversation in meteorology circles since at least the 1940s and ‘50s, experts told us. The polar vortex is the region in the northern hemisphere that contains the planet’s cold or Arctic air. A warmer atmosphere lies outside of the vortex. The boundary between the regions is a jet stream of strong, fast-moving, frigid winds. Sometimes the jet stream is more symmetrical, encircling the polar region in an oval without many bumps. Other times, especially this week, its rotation breaks off into deep troughs, ushering cold air to the south. A polar outbreak occurs in areas that have big drops in temperature, where the polar vortex has dipped pronouncedly south. This jet stream has become more wavy in the last five years, sending more cold air to the eastern U.S. and eastern Asia, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""It has been with us for eons,"" said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado-Boulder. ""It will be with us for eons to come."" Now, whether this week’s polar outbreak is a result of global warming is a matter of active scientific debate. Rutgers University climate researcher Jennifer Francis co-authored a 2012 research paper arguing the loss of Arctic ice leads to more extremes -- not just more frigid winters for the east coast, but also record warm temperatures in Alaska, record drought in California, storms in the United Kingdom, and a warm winter for Scandinavia. ""This sort of jet stream pattern is what we expect to occur more often as the Arctic continues to warm faster than the rest of the globe in response to increasing greenhouse gases,"" she said. ""We can't say this particular event is caused by climate change, but it is becoming clearer that this sort of pattern should become more likely in the future."" On his show, Limbaugh skewered a Daily Beast article with the headline ""Thank Global Warming for Freezing You Right Now,"" but the article actually couches the connection more than its flashy headline suggests: ""As crazy as it sounds, global warming may be at least partly to blame. This particular aspect of climate change science is not yet definitive, but here's what may be going on."" Serreze says it is too early to tell whether one-time weather events like this polar outbreak are happening as a result of global warming. That said, the polar outbreak definitely does not disprove that Arctic sea ice is not melting, as Limbaugh concludes. Sea ice at the North Pole is obviously not melting right this second. That’s because it’s January, and the pole is in darkness all day and night. But Arctic sea ice is almost at a record low for this time of year, Francis pointed out, even though it is up from 2012, the record low year. Scientists look at long-term trends, not annual shifts, to base their conclusions. Alarm over shrinking sea ice is based on how the region is shedding more and more of it by the end of summer -- as less ice covers the Arctic Ocean, the ocean absorbs more warmth. Historically, ice covering the Arctic sea is twice as big as the continental United States by winter’s end in March, Serreze said. As the ocean warms, ice melts. Around 1980, sea ice by summer’s end in September covered as much area as the contiguous United States, Serreze said. Lately, it’s shrunk to an area smaller than the size of the United States west of the Mississippi River. ""The long-term trend in Arctic sea ice is sharply downwards, and this trend has the capability to cause significant alterations in jet stream behavior that can cause an increase in both warm and cold extreme events in the winter,"" said Jeff Masters, director of meteorology at Weather Underground. Serreze labeled Limbaugh’s connection between the cold snap and sea ice as ""absurd."" Our ruling Limbaugh claimed the media made up the ""polar vortex"" to bolster global warming. What the cold snap does prove, he says, is Arctic sea ice is not melting -- that global warming is a hoax. Climate scientists told us his rant is wildly misinformed. The polar vortex has been a part of science for decades, and it certainly does not prove that sea ice is not melting",False Pants on Fire,"January 8, 2014"
"""61 percent of non-tea party Republicans actually agree...there is 'solid evidence the earth is warming,' ...[but] 70 percent of tea partiers, contrarily, say there is 'no solid evidence' the earth is warming.""","During his weekly floor speeches on climate change, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse has been promoting the idea that congressional Republicans who blocked climate change legislation are out of touch with Republicans throughout the United States. On Nov. 25, PolitiFact Rhode Island gave a Mostly True ruling on Whitehouse’s claim that, in a poll, ""53 percent of young Republican voters . . . under age 35 said that they would describe a climate [change] denier as 'ignorant,' 'out of touch' or 'crazy.'"" Whitehouse repeated his assertion about young Republicans in a slightly different way during his Dec. 17 speech on climate, his 53rd, focusing on the attitudes of the tea party faction of the Republican Party. He cited a poll that looked at all Republicans, not just those under age 35. ""Another national survey, this one by the Pew Research Center, found that most -- 61 percent of non-tea party Republicans -- actually agree, actually agree there is 'solid evidence the earth is warming,' with a plurality saying it is 'mostly because of humans,'"" Whitehouse said. ""But the tea partiers are different,"" he added. ""Seventy percent of tea partiers, contrarily, say there is 'No solid evidence' the earth is warming. And 41 percent of tea partiers assert that warming is 'Just not happening.'"" ""Unfortunately here in Congress,"" he said later in the speech, ""the dark, heavy hand of the polluters is helping the tea party drive the Republican Party off the cliff."" Was Whitehouse correctly characterizing the attitudes of Republicans in general and members of the tea party in particular? We went back to the Pew survey to look at those numbers. Pew conducted the poll of 1,504 adults from Oct. 9-13, 2013; 655 said they were Republicans or leaned Republican, and 304 of them identified with the tea party. Asked whether there is ""solid evidence the earth is warming,"" 61 percent of non-tea party Republicans said yes; just 25 percent of tea party supporters said yes. (The margin of error for tea party numbers is plus or minus 6.5 percentage points and 6.2 percentage points for non-tea party Republicans. So Whitehouse quoted the findings accurately, within the margin of error. Whitehouse was also correct when he said that 70 percent of tea party members responding said there is no solid evidence that Earth is warming, with 41 percent saying it's just not happening. In contrast, a mere 13 percent of other Republicans said it's ""just not happening."" Yet just because Republicans think there's good evidence that Earth is warming doesn't mean they think human activity is responsible. That's an important point to consider when looking at whether members of the GOP support trying to do something to reverse the trend. Among non-tea party Republicans who thought the planet is warming, nearly 40 percent said it was due to natural patterns. Our ruling Sheldon Whitehouse said that ""61 percent of non-tea party Republicans actually agree . . . there is 'solid evidence the earth is warming,' . . . [but] 70 percent of tea partiers, contrarily, say there is 'no solid evidence' the earth is warming."" The senator was accurately quoting the results of the October Pew poll. But there's more to the story if you want to understand the ongoing opposition to climate change legislation by supporters of the GOP. While many non-tea party Republicans acknowledge that climate change is occurring, a majority (54 percent) still either deny climate change or think it is part of a natural cycle not caused by human activity. That's an important factor to consider, which Whitehouse omitted",Mostly True,"December 28, 2013"
"""The Earth is not warming.""","Barry Smitherman sees the planet as not warming. Smitherman, a candidate for Texas attorney general, responded to Republican activist Donna Garner in a Nov. 17, 2013, email: ""Donna, I have been battling this global warming hoax for 6 years now. The earth is not warming…"" A day later, Garner included his comment in an email blast to recipients including reporters. That claim by Smitherman, who also chairs the Texas Railroad Commission, contradicts the latest word from the international body that regularly sifts scientific findings related to climate. An October 2013 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report intended for policymakers states: ""Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased."" Candidate's backup We were curious how Smitherman reached his conclusion. His campaign consultant, Allen Blakemore, emailed us web links to about a dozen articles essentially saying that the planet has not been warming as fast as predicted of late or is, in fact, cooling. A Jan. 27, 2012, Wall Street Journal opinion piece, signed by 16 scientists, said there was no need for countries to take drastic steps against greenhouse gases. A secondary theme of the piece was that planetary warming had been smaller than predicted for more than a decade. Similarly, a Sept. 8, 2013, news story in the Telegraph, a British newspaper, said: ""Despite the original forecasts, major climate research centres now accept that there has been a ‘pause’ in global warming since 1997."" The story quoted two U.S. professors, Judith Curry of the Georgia Institute of Technology and Anastasios Tsonis of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, as saying the planet appears headed into a cooling period. A Forbes magazine article by Peter Ferrara, published May 31, 2012, said ""natural climate cycles have already turned from warming to cooling, global temperatures have already been declining for more than 10 years, and global temperatures will continue to decline for another two decades or more,"" a conclusion Ferrara attributed to presentations at a conference on climate change hosted by the libertarian Heartland Institute. By email, Blakemore and Jared Craighead, Smitherman’s campaign manager, urged us to view a video placed on YouTube on June 27, 2012, of a presentation by Don Easterbrook, a professor emeritus of geology at Western Washington University. In it, Easterbrook said that scant temperature changes support his 2000 statement that global warming is over, making the key question only how intense the cooling period will be. Also noted by Blakemore: An Oct. 13, 2012, commentary by David Rose in the Daily Mail, a British publication, which began: ""The world stopped getting warmer almost 16 years ago, according to new data released last week. The figures, which have triggered debate among climate scientists, reveal that from the beginning of 1997 until August 2012, there was no discernible rise in aggregate global temperatures. This means that the ‘plateau’ or ‘pause’ in global warming has now lasted for about the same time as the previous period when temperatures rose, 1980 to 1996. Before that, temperatures had been stable or declining for about 40 years."" Rose quoted Curry, of Georgia, as saying the data confirmed a pause in global warming. ""Climate models are very complex, but they are imperfect and incomplete,"" Curry said. ""Natural variability (the impact of factors such as long-term temperature cycles in the oceans and the output of the sun) has been shown over the past two decades to have a magnitude that dominates the greenhouse warming effect. It is becoming increasingly apparent that our attribution of warming since 1980 and future projections of climate change needs to consider natural internal variability as a factor of fundamental importance,"" Curry said. Still, and in contrast to Smitherman’s claim, the Daily Mail article closed by referring to global warming as ""real, and some of it at least has been caused by the CO2 emitted by fossil fuels. But the evidence is beginning to suggest that it may be happening much slower than the catastrophists have claimed–a conclusion with enormous policy implications."" Debate about reconsideration By email, Curry didn’t directly answer whether the globe is warming: ""There has been no statistically significant increase in global average surface temperatures for the past 17 years."" Per Curry’s point, Michael Tobis, an Austin software engineer whose blog, Planet 3.0, often brushes climate topics, said by email: ""There are strong indications that the deep ocean is heating more than anticipated, which would account for some missing warming at the surface… But it's crucial to understand this--the world has not wandered so far from what we expected as to require a deep reconsideration of the consensus"" that global warming persists. Tobis continued: ""There's no doubt that CO2 is piling up in the atmosphere. There's no doubt that human activity caused it. There's no doubt that CO2 is a major factor in how energy flows through the climate system, and that changing it leads to a changed climate. There's practically no doubt that in the long run the planet will end up substantially warmer than it is. Figuring out how it gets from here to there matters a lot to human beings who live out our brief lives during the adjustment period. And there are some uncertainties there--it turns out transitions are harder to calculate than final outcomes. But nothing we see reduces our confidence in our understanding."" Separately, the Texas state climatologist, John Nielsen-Gammon, pointed out by email a National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration chart indicating a steady rise in ocean heat content, meaning temperatures averaged through the depth of the ocean, since the late 1960s. Like Tobis, though, Nielsen-Gammon said temperatures near the ocean surface have risen more slowly in the past 15 years or so ""than they had during the previous 35, and it is possible to find time intervals (such as the past five years) in which all weather station and satellite-based global temperature compilations show a declining trend. Overall, the global surface temperature trend is essentially flat since the dramatic and unusual warmth of the 1998 El Niño year. Nielsen-Gammon’s email continued: ""Just about everyone, including some of the sources quoted in the articles you listed,"" meaning the articles noted by Smitherman’s consultant, ""believes that the present lack of surface temperature warming is both natural and temporary. Climate model projections have generally been higher than observed temperatures, which depending on your interpretation means that natural variability has temporarily masked some of the warming or that the models have overestimated the amount of non-natural warming. The causes of the discrepancy are the subject of considerable research."" Cherry-picking a time period Our own online search led us to a Sept. 10, 2013, commentary by Forbes magazine staff writer Alex Knapp taking Rose to task for focusing too closely on short-term temperature changes. On the suggestion that global warming paused in 1997, Knapp wrote: ""Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, ‘All of the top ten warmest years in the record have occurred since the last major El Niño event, in 1998.’ What’s more, according to NOAA, ‘Since 1976, every year including 2012 has had an annual temperature above the long-term average.’ In fact the two warmest years on record are 2005 and 2010, and the years between 2000 and 2010 had higher average temperatures than the years between 1990 and 1999. ""To show the continued rise of global average temperatures over the decades, this chart from the World Meteorological Organization helps to make it pretty clear: ""These rising temperatures have serious consequences. Rising temperatures melt glaciers on land, including Greenland and Antarctica. As those melts make their way to the oceans, they cause sea levels to rise. And those rising sea levels are real and have been measured. Here’s a chart of sea level rise since the 1880s – you can see the steadily rising trend for yourself. ""The bottom line is that, as I wrote last summer, ‘In the end, everything about climate science boils down to one simple fact: all else being equal, increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide in a mixture of gasses will cause the mixture to absorb more heat.’"" Knapp closed: ""For our planet, that means as more carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere, the warmer the planet will get. Sure, there might be some short term anomalies – one year might be cooler than its preceding year, for instance – but the long term trend remains…"" Texas and U.S. climatologists Broadly, the Texas climatologists we reached said Smitherman got it wrong. ""The Earth is warming,"" Nielsen-Gammon said. By email, Katharine Hayhoe, director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University, called Smitherman’s claim incorrect, adding: ""First, climate is defined as the average over 20-30 years or more precisely because atmospheric scientists know that short-term natural cycles in the rates at which heat is exchanged between the ocean and atmosphere can lead to variations in global air temperature over shorter time scales."" Hayhoe and Tobis each cautioned that cherry-picking start and stop years can lead to factually skewed conclusions about temperature trends.""If you cherry-pick short periods of time, you can end up with nearly any result you want,"" Hayhoe said. ""Only by looking at the entire dataset can you see what the truth is."" Hayhoe noted, too, that a study accepted for online posting by the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Metereological Society on Nov. 12, 2013, shortly before Smitherman wrote his email, indicates that global temperatures have been underestimated since 1997 because they did not correctly reflect Arctic warming. Hayhoe further said the proper measure of warming extends past ocean or air temperatures alone. She pointed us to a chart posted on the Skeptical Science website, which focuses on touting peer-reviewed science related to climate change and debunking arguments built on incomplete information. The chart indicates that based on data published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres in September 2009, the ocean and earth have been warming for the past 50 years. Curiously, the state commission chaired by Smitherman, which regulates oil and gas exploration, has a section of its website detailing scientific concerns about greenhouse gases and global warming. A source note on that site led us to the U.S. Global Change Research Program, a federal effort launched by Congress in 1990 to coordinate and integrate global change research across 13 government agencies.  We then downloaded a draft ""climate assessment"" report from the program, dated Jan. 11, 2013, including a letter to the American people stating: ""Long-term, independent records from weather stations, satellites, ocean buoys, tide gauges, and many other data sources all confirm the fact that our nation, like the rest of the world, is warming, precipitation patterns are changing, sea level is rising, and some types of extreme weather events are increasing,"" the draft said. Another part of the draft, prepared by the 60-member National Climate Assessment and Development Advisory Committee, said: ""Evidence for climate change abounds, from the top of the atmosphere to the depths of the oceans. This evidence has been compiled by scientists and engineers from around the world, using satellites, weather balloons, thermometers, buoys, and other observing systems. The sum total of this evidence tells an unambiguous story: the planet is warming. U.S. average temperature has increased by about 1.5°F since 1895; more than 80% of this increase has occurred since 1980. The most recent decade was the nation’s hottest on record."" Previous fact checks From another vantag point, recent fact checks do not support Smitherman’s statement. PolitiFact New Jersey in July 2013 rated as True a claim that every ""single month since 1985 has been warmer than the historic average"" and that all ""12 of the warmest years on record have come in the last 15 years."" Those statistics were backed up by data released by NOAA scientists and NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. As for the warmest years on record, NOAA scientists estimate that the last 15 years have included the 14 hottest years and NASA scientists have said that same time period included the 13 hottest years. A month later, though, PolitiFact Rhode Island rated as Half True a claim that global surface temperatures have been flat for 16 years. This held up partly due to the cherry-picked and short timeframe, which swept in 1998, the El Niño year that made surface temperatures exceptionally warm. When you start near an unusually hot year, there's a good chance that subsequent years will be cooler. That fact check considered major climate databases including one from NASA and another from the Hadley Centre of the Met Office, which is the United Kingdom's National Weather Service. It also tapped a tool available at SkepticalScience.com, whose Temperature Trend Calculator page allows users to pick from among several sets of temperature data and pick various timeframes. Hadley showed a .170 degree increase over those 16 years and NASA's numbers showed a .251 rise. Neither increase exceeded what could have happened by chance. Upshot: The global temperatures that were rising so rapidly in the 1970s, ‘80s, and ‘90s appeared to have stalled. In fact, the Met Office had begun referring to the latest 16 years as ""the recent pause in warming."" Officials there had issued three reports to try to explain the plateau. They stressed that the last decade was still the warmest on record and asserted that temperatures will likely resume their rapid rise soon, although the agency is not offering a timetable. Said physicist Robert Brecha, of the University of Dayton: ""There is increasing evidence in the peer-reviewed literature that over the past decade or so more thermal energy is going into the deep ocean, rather than into the atmosphere. This is almost certainly just a temporary, cyclical process. The key point is that additional greenhouse gases trap heat in the earth system, keeping that energy from flowing back out to space,"" Brecha said. ""So if the atmosphere doesn't receive that heat [thereby increasing its temperature] that trapped energy is nevertheless building up."" For our part, we rated as Pants on Fire a legislator’s April 2013 claim that science has not shown greenhouse gases to be a problem. To the contrary, scientists have agreed for years that such gases contribute to atmospheric changes driving climatic warming. Naomi Oreskes, then a professor of history at the University of California, San Diego, sent us a chapter of a pending book updating her 2004 look into scientific consensus about climate change. A portion of the chapter said: ""Scientists predicted a long time ago that increasing greenhouse gas emissions could change the climate, and now there is overwhelming evidence that it is changing the climate."" However, ""to say that man-made global warming is underway is not the same as agreeing about what will happen in the future. Much of the continuing debate in the scientific community involves the likely rate of future change."" ""There are climate scientists who actively do research in the field but disagree with the consensus position,"" the chapter later says, ""but their number is very, very small."" We also contacted Oreskes for this article. She passed our inquiry to Richard Somerville, a professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, who emailed us calling Smitherman’s claim ""nonsense."" Somerville wrote: ""It is just plain foolish to focus on short-term distractions in the climate record due to natural variability, while ignoring the long term-trend due to human activities."" Somerville described Smitherman’s offered articles as unscientific, adding: ""They misrepresent or ignore what climate science has actually discovered(.)"" By email, Craighead of Smitherman’s campaign responded by stressing afresh the Easterbook presentation indicating a global cooling period since 1999. Our ruling Smitherman said the Earth is not warming. To the contrary, national, international and Texas climate authorities concur that the planet is warming. They also warn against cherry-picking individual climatic indicators or timeframes to conclude otherwise. That makes sense to us. In the end, this claim strikes us as both unfounded and ridiculous",False Pants on Fire,"December 13, 2013"
"In a poll, ""53 percent of young Republican voters . . . under age 35 said that they would describe a climate [change] denier as 'ignorant,' 'out of touch' or 'crazy.'""","Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) has now made 50 speeches on the floor of the U.S. Senate urging his colleagues and other Americans to ""wake up"" about the issue of climate change. He has railed against global warming skeptics, many of them Republicans who say that the planet is not warming or, if it is, the warming isn't caused by human activity. During his Nov. 13 speech, he argued that ""the polls show clearly that climate denial is a losing tactic"" and young people aren't fooled by the arguments of climate change ""deniers."" We've fact-checked two other Whitehouse statements from his previous speeches about climate issues. We ruled his claim that the oceans ""have become 30 percent more acidic"" Mostly True; his assertion that Narragansett Bay waters have gotten 4 degrees warmer in the winter since the 1960s earned a Half True. In his Nov. 13 speech, one of the poll numbers he cited caught our eye. ""Fifty three percent of young Republican voters -- Republican voters under age 35 -- said that they would describe a climate [change] denier as 'ignorant,' 'out of touch' or 'crazy,'"" Whitehouse said. ""Republicans outside of Congress are trying to lead their party back to reality and away from what even young Republicans are calling ignorant, out of touch or crazy extremist views."" Do more than half of young-adult Republicans really think climate change skeptics are loopy? Whitehouse’s office said he got the figure from a survey commissioned by the League of Conservation Voters, an environmental advocacy group. The league hired two firms -- GS Strategy Group (which does Republican polling) and Benensen Strategy Group (President Obama's chief pollster) -- to conduct a joint poll of 600 registered voters, ages 18 to 34, last July. Fifty-three percent of Republicans under 35 said they would ""describe a politician who says climate change is not really happening"" as out of touch, ignorant or crazy, according to a joint July 24, 2013 memo from the polling firms. (The rest, if they had an opinion, preferred characterizations such as ""independent,"" ""commonsense"" or ""thoughtful,"" which were the three positive options offered.) When Democrats and independents were added in, the ratio of people who considered deniers to be out of touch, ignorant or crazy jumped to 73 percent, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent. ""It is not surprising then that a climate change denier faces stiff headwinds with young voters, with 68% saying they would be less likely to vote for a climate change denier,"" according to the report. ""And even among Republicans, 47% would be less likely to vote for a denier."" It should be noted that only 7 percent of all respondents -- Republicans, Democrats and  independents -- characterized deniers as ""crazy."" We asked the League for a Republicans-only breakdown in that category because we suspect that very few would put skeptics in the crazy category. Spokesman Jeff Gohringer said the League would not release any further data. ""The purpose of the poll was to show that Republicans understand climate change is happening and they want to see action,"" he said. ""The disconnect in Washington is that this is somehow a party issue, that the Democrats support it and Republicans don't. But huge swaths of both parties support action on climate and they know it's a problem."" One important caveat should be noted. The poll asked respondents to classify people who argue that climate change is not really happening. But that's only the most extreme type of climate change ""denier,"" a word never used in the survey. Other people sometimes saddled with that label acknowledge that the climate is changing, but they argue that it's due to natural variability, not human activity. So the League poll only characterized the deniers with the most extreme -- and scientifically untenable -- position. That's an important distinction, which can be seen in the Pew Research Center's recent national survey on climate change, conducted Oct. 9-13, among 1,504 adults. A hefty 46 percent of all Republicans said there is solid evidence that Earth is warming. But the percentage drops to half that amount (23 percent) when Republicans were asked if the warming is mostly due to human activity. Nineteen percent of the GOP respondents said it's due to natural patterns. Our ruling Sheldon Whitehouse said, ""53 percent of young Republican voters . . . under age 35 said that they would describe a climate [change] denier as 'ignorant,' 'out of touch' or 'crazy.'"" He cited the number accurately. But the findings come from just one poll, commissioned by a conservation group. And the question he referenced focused only on the most extreme position of climate change ""deniers"" (those who believe that the climate is not changing). That term can also include people who acknowledge that climate change is occurring but don't believe it’s caused by humans. Whitehouse is making a leap by suggesting that the League survey is a gauge of how all ""deniers"" are regarded by younger Republicans",Mostly True,"November 25, 2013"
"Says U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson voted to let oil and gas companies emit ""unlimited carbon pollution into our air""","On Aug. 14, 2013 -- more than three years before U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson could face re-election -- a national environmental group hit him with an attack ad. The first-term Wisconsin Republican responded by using the TV spot to solicit political contributions. We didn’t think we’d have to go into campaign mode yet for the 2016 elections. But we’re game. In the ad, the League of Conservation Voters alleges that Johnson ""has taken more than $100,000 from oil and gas and voted to let them keep spewing unlimited carbon pollution into our air."" Johnson has received $109,550 from oil and gas interests since his campaign for the 2010 election, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign contributions. So that is not really in dispute. Let’s see if he voted in favor of unlimited carbon pollution. Getting our bearings To be clear on terminology, we'll start with four points. 1. Global warming: The world’s leading science academies have long warned that the planet is warming. The pace has slowed in the past 15 years, although 2000 through 2009 was the warmest decade on record, according to NASA. In August 2013 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international panel of scientists, reiterated the role of human beings, saying in a draft report the odds are at least 95 percent that humans are the main cause of the warming in recent decades. 2. Greenhouse gases: The main human-caused producer of global warming is the emission of greenhouse gases, which trap the Earth's heat. 3. Carbon dioxide: Carbon dioxide makes up 84 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which has determined that greenhouse gases are a threat to humans. 4. Carbon pollution: Carbon dioxide -- or carbon pollution, the term used in the ad -- comes largely from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas. Like Johnson, many congressional Republicans elected in 2010 have expressed doubt about the science of global warming and opposed regulation of climate-altering gases. The ad’s evidence The Washington, D.C.-based League of Conservation Voters is ""a liberal-leaning organization that raises money primarily in support of environmentally friendly public policy,"" according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In the 2011-2012 election cycle, the five candidates who received the most money from the league -- Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin among them -- all were Democrats. To back its claim against Johnson, the League of Conservation Voters cited three Senate votes, each an amendment to a bill; one was in 2011 and two were on the same day in 2013. Two of the votes were noted in the ad and the third was cited by the league as additional evidence. 1. EPA regulations, April 6, 2011 Johnson voted for a failed amendment to an unrelated small-business bill. The amendment would have prohibited the EPA from regulating greenhouse gas emissions and repealed the agency’s scientific finding that carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases are endangering human health and the environment. So, under Johnson’s vote, the EPA couldn’t regulate any carbon emissions, including those emitted in the extraction and refining of oil, or by gasoline-burning vehicles. 2. Global warming, March 22, 2013 Johnson voted for a failed amendment to the 2014 federal budget bill. The amendment would have prohibited ""further greenhouse gas regulations for the purposes of addressing climate change,"" which includes global warming. Like the earlier vote, Johnson supported the status quo: no federal limits on emissions of carbon dioxide, or carbon pollution, whether by oil and gas companies or other energy producers. 3. Carbon emissions, March 22, 2013 Johnson voted for another amendment to the budget to require a vote of 60 senators in order to enact a new federal tax or fee on carbon emissions.The amendment passed. This measure doesn’t regulate carbon emissions, per se, but does make it more difficult to tax emissions. Such a tax, arguably, could lead to less production of energy that results in carbon emissions. For our purposes, the third vote really isn’t necessary in evaluating the claim against Johnson. The intent of the other two votes is clear. Johnson spokeswoman Melinda Whitemarsh Schnell told us the three votes sought to stop President Barack Obama’s administration ""from passing regulations that Congress had earlier refused to enact."" She also called the ad misleading because it showed smokestacks that suggested the production of electricity, and said gas and oil companies are not responsible for the carbon emissions used to make electricity. But the question here is the effect of the measures Johnson voted for. Chip Knappenberger, assistant director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, told us that as a practical matter, the only way to reduce carbon pollution is to reduce the amount of fossil fuel produced. But he said Johnson's votes do preserve the status quo, which has no limits on greenhouse gas emissions. Our rating The League of Conservation Voters said Johnson voted to let oil and gas companies ""keep spewing unlimited carbon pollution into our air."" Johnson voted twice to prohibit the EPA from regulating any carbon emissions",True,"August 29, 2013"
"""Global surface temperatures have been flat for 16 years.""","Sometimes it's the contradictions that drive PolitiFact to check a statement. In a commentary published Aug. 5, 2013, in The Providence Journal, Steve Goreham, executive director of the Climate Science Coalition of America, was critical of the science behind the warnings that Earth is getting hotter due to pollution. His first paragraph made this assertion: ""Global surface temperatures have been flat for 16 years."" Yet three days earlier, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that 2012 was one of the 10 warmest years on record. All 10 have occurred since 1998. Who's right here? We decided to check Goreham's factoid. We contacted him to ask where he got his numbers and how his claim stacked up with NOAA's. ""The short answer is that both are correct,"" he said in an email. ""Temperatures have been flat for the last 16 years and 2012 was one of the 10 warmest years on record."" We weren't sure how they could both be correct, so we again asked Goreham what he was using for data. We didn't hear back immediately, so we started looking on our own. Our first stop was the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration database. Those data show that over the past 16 years -- 1997 through 2012 -- 15 have been the warmest on record. The readings go back to 1880. But how did the temperatures change during that period? In 2012, the global temperature was 0.43 degrees Fahrenheit higher over land than it was in 1997. Over land and water, the difference was 0.11 degrees. That's not flat. But temperatures naturally fluctuate so much from year to year, It's misleading to just compare two points in time. Goreham is talking about the overall trend, which climate experts use to see long-term changes over time. To find a trend, you have to do a more sophisticated calculation, preferably over a much longer period than 16 years. But 16 years is the period Goreham chose -- and what many other global warming skeptics have focused on -- so we'll stick with that for now. The trend line shows that the annual global temperatures listed by NOAA rose by 0.141 degrees during that stretch. To put this in perspective, when you're only dealing with a 16-year period, a lot depends on when you want to start looking. If you shift the timeframe back by just one year, beginning with 1996, the increase more than doubles, to 0.351 degrees. When we heard back from Goreham after asking about the NOAA database, he said we would ""probably"" see flat temperatures beginning in 1997. He also suggested we look beginning in 2001 to 2012 and said the temperature trend in that period would be flat. In fact, it was a bit negative. But that's not the 16 years he cited in his claim. Why start 16 years ago? It includes 1998, when an El Nino made surface temperatures exceptionally warm. When you start near an unusually hot year, there's a good chance that subsequent years will be cooler. There's another problem: When you get into temperature changes that small and time frames that short, the natural variability of climate can be so large that any ""trend"" might be the result of chance. ""Generally, for these short periods, if you're within 0.05 [of a degree Celsius] per decade you're not significantly different from zero,"" said John Christy of the University of Alabama in Huntsville, one of the country's best-known skeptics of global warming. (Over a 16-year period, that means the change would have to be higher or lower than 0.144 degrees Fahrenheit to be significant.) ""None of the data sets show anything much different from zero since the last 16, 17 years,"" he said. Since the 1998 El Nino, ""it's been pretty flat. There's been a slowdown in the trend."" So by Christy's gauge of what would be significant, the 0.141 degree increase from 1997 through 2012 seen in the NOAA database is essentially no increase, as Goreham said. In addition to the NOAA database, we looked at the two other major climate databases, one from NASA and the other from the Hadley Centre of the Met Office, which is the United Kingdom's National Weather Service. We used a tool available at SkepticalScience.com, which supports the global warming theory as do the vast majority of climate scientists. Its Temperature Trend Calculator page allows users to pick from among several sets of temperature data and pick various timeframes. Hadley showed a .170 degree increase over those 16 years and NASA's numbers showed a .251 rise. Although they would indicate a significant rise by Christy's off-the-cuff definition, a more precise calculation done by the Temperature Trend Calculator showed that none of the increases exceeded chance. Thus, the global temperatures that were rising so rapidly in the 1970s, ‘80s, and ‘90s have stalled. The Met Office has begun referring to the last 16 years as ""the recent pause in warming."" Officials there have issued three reports to try to explain the plateau. They stressed that the last decade was still the warmest on record and asserted that temperatures will likely resume their rapid rise soon, although the agency is not offering a timetable. Said physicist Robert Brecha, of the University of Dayton: ""There is increasing evidence in the peer-reviewed literature that over the past decade or so more thermal energy is going into the deep ocean, rather than into the atmosphere. This is almost certainly just a temporary, cyclical process. ""The key point is that additional greenhouse gases trap heat in the earth system, keeping that energy from flowing back out to space,"" Brecha said. ""So if the atmosphere doesn't receive that heat [thereby increasing its temperature] that trapped energy is nevertheless building up."" One last note. Goreham, in his commentary, was citing the 16-year trend in a broader context. He and other warming skeptics argue, with some justification, that the newest global readings are so far afield from the alarming temperature increases that were once predicted by climate computer models, it raises serious questions about whether scientists understand Earth's changing climate as well as they think they do, and whether it's worth spending trillions of dollars to try to influence it. But we'll save that controversy for another fact-check. Our ruling Steve Goreham said ""Global surface temperatures have been flat for 16 years."" The databases we checked generally show small increases during that period, but not enough to be statistically significant, thanks to a short timeframe and a starting point that included an unusually warm year in 1998. That's why, at the same time, NOAA data clearly show that global temperatures in 15 of the last 16 years have been the hottest recorded. So Goreham is correct that the temperature trend has been flat, but it's flat at record highs",Half True,"August 25, 2013"
"Sen. Marco Rubio ""refuses to accept the basic science"" on climate change and is ""a climate change denier.""","In a recent email to supporters in Florida, Organizing for Action -- a group that supports President Barack Obama -- criticized the climate change policies of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., one of the Senate’s leading Republicans and a possible 2016 presidential contender. The email, signed by Ivan Frishberg, the group’s climate campaign manager, begins like this: ""Friend -- ""We're spending the next week of Action August getting serious about climate change. ""To get ready, we're calling out Sen. Marco Rubio, who refuses to accept the basic science on this issue -- and is standing in the way of action. ""It's time everyone in Florida knows: Sen. Rubio is a climate change denier."" The email goes on to say that ""there are 135 documented climate change deniers currently roaming the halls of Congress."" The full list is here, but in this item we’ll be focusing on whether Rubio ""is a climate change denier."" We should clarify up front: In the policy context, the term ""climate change"" refers to rising temperatures and sea levels caused by human beings and their use of carbon-dioxide-emitting fossil fuels. (We should also note that Rubio’s staff did not respond when contacted for this story.) In supporting its claim, OFA cites a Feb. 13, 2010, article in the Tampa Tribune. According to the Tribune, Rubio called his then-Senate opponent Charlie Crist ""a believer in man-made global warming"" and said, ""I don't think there's the scientific evidence to justify it."" Asked whether he accepts scientific evidence that the global climate is undergoing change, Rubio responded, ""The climate is always changing. The climate is never static. The question is whether it's caused by man-made activity and whether it justifies economically destructive government regulation."" After trying to locate as many of Rubio’s comments on climate change as we could, we concluded that the Tribune story is indeed the strongest evidence OFA can use to support its labeling of Rubio as a ""climate change denier."" Rubio’s language to the Tribune is pretty clear: He doesn’t think there’s sufficient scientific evidence to support the claim that the climate is changing due to human factors. However, on other occasions -- both before and after the Tribune interview -- Rubio has offered somewhat more nuanced opinions on the topic. Initially, when he was speaker of the Florida House, Rubio seemed to tacitly support the idea that the earth’s temperatures were rising, even as he sometimes differed with environmentalists over specific policy options. While Rubio was speaker in 2008, the House unanimously passed a law ordering the state Department of Environmental Protection to develop rules for companies to limit their emissions of carbon dioxide, a pollutant that scientists say may be contributing to global warming. In a 2007 speech to fellow legislators, Rubio urged his state to become a Silicon Valley of the new energy-technology economy. ""Global warming, dependence on foreign sources of fuel, and capitalism have come together to create opportunities for us that were unimaginable just a few short years ago,"" he said. ""Today, Florida has the opportunity to pursue bold energy policies, not just because they’re good for our environment, but because people can actually make money doing it. This nation and ultimately the world is headed toward emission caps and energy diversification."" By phrasing it this way, without any effort to question the scientific underpinnings of global warming, Rubio suggested that he tacitly supported the science behind global warming. He made the same implication when he wrote in a 2007 Miami Herald op-ed, ""Whether motivated by global warming or geopolitics, there is widespread support for diversifying our energy portfolio and becoming more efficient in our use of energy."" By Dec. 10, 2009, Rubio was openly hedging his position on climate change science. Confronted with accusations that he had flip-flopped on climate change, Rubio told the Miami Herald, ""I'm not a scientist. I'm not qualified to make that decision. There's a significant scientific dispute about that.'' Rubio’s next flurry of comments on climate change came in 2013, after he had become a leading figure in the national GOP. Here are Rubio’s recent comments: • BuzzFeed interview, Feb. 5, 2013: In a video interview with the website BuzzFeed, Rubio said, ""The United States is a country, not a planet. On the other hand, if we unilaterally impose these sorts of things on our economy, you could have a devastating impact on economics. ... There has to be a cost-benefit analysis to every one of these principles people are pushing on. … The climate’s always changing -- that’s not the fundamental question. The fundamental question is whether man-made activity is what’s contributing most to it. I know people said there’s a significant scientific consensus on that issue, but I’ve actually seen reasonable debate on that principle."" • Republican response to the State of the Union address, Feb. 12, 2013. Responding to Obama’s speech, Rubio said, ""When we point out that no matter how many job-killing laws we pass, our government can’t control the weather – he accuses us of wanting dirty water and dirty air."" • Fox and Friends interview, Feb. 13, 2013. The day after his response to the State of the Union address, Rubio said, ""The government can’t change the weather. I said that in the speech. We can pass a bunch of laws that will destroy our economy, but it isn’t going to change the weather. Because, for example, there are other countries that are polluting in the atmosphere much greater than we are at this point -- China, India, all these countries that are still growing. They’re not going to stop doing what they’re doing. America is a country, it’s not a planet. So we can pass a bunch of laws or executive orders that will do nothing to change the climate or the weather but will devastate our economy -- devastate it."" • Statement on his Senate Web page, posted June 25, 2013: In response to a speech in which Obama outlined a series of measures on climate change that he could accomplish by executive order, Rubio said: ""This time, President Obama is discarding the Constitution and free enterprise system in the name of a job-killing environmental agenda. We must do everything we can to stand in his way."" In these comments, Rubio expressed strong opposition to Obama’s climate change policies, particularly on the grounds that the benefits would not exceed the costs. And he seemed to exude skepticism that climate change was an urgent policy concern, as well as the sentiment that human actions cannot change something as massive as the weather. Still, in these comments, Rubio never explicitly denied the science behind climate change, as he did three years earlier in the Tribune interview. In fact, in the BuzzFeed conversation, Rubio conceded that ""I’ve actually seen reasonable debate on that principle."" Someone who is a ""denier"" does not typically concede that his opponents may have a ""reasonable"" point. Our ruling Organizing for Action said that Rubio ""refuses to accept the basic science"" on climate change and is ""a climate change denier."" Rubio’s 2010 comments to the Tampa Tribune -- when he said, ""I don't think there's the scientific evidence to justify it"" -- represent the clearest evidence in support of the group’s charge. In that comment, Rubio does sound like he is denying the existence of science that supports the climate change hypothesis. Since then -- including on four separate occasions this year -- Rubio has expressed opposition to climate change policies while speaking more cautiously about the science that proves climate change is happening. On one of those occasions in February, he even conceded that he’s seen ""reasonable debate"" about the question. But in none of those instances did Rubio walk back his 2010 remarks, even though he had several opportunities to do so",Mostly True,"August 16, 2013"
"""For several days in July of 2012, Greenland surface ice cover melted more than at any time in 30 years of satellite observation. During that month, an estimated 97% of the ice sheet thawed.""","Everybody's looking for evidence that pollution, particularly the carbon dioxide released into the air, is (or is not, depending on your point of view) altering Earth's climate. On July 24, U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii, whose state stands to face some serious consequences if warmer temperatures cause sea levels to rise and storms to become stronger, was on the floor of the Senate speaking about an event in July 2012 that produced a dramatic change in the massive ice sheet covering Greenland. Because of global warming, ""glaciers continue to retreat. The Greenland ice sheet provides a stark example of the rapid recession of the world's ice,"" Schatz said. ""For several days in July of 2012, Greenland surface ice cover melted more than at any time in 30 years of satellite observation. During that month, an estimated 97 percent of the ice sheet thawed."" Ninety-seven percent? One way to read that is that only 3 percent of Greenland's ice sheet remained. That would be A LOT of melting, especially for a mass of ice that is, over large stretches, a mile or two thick. Losing that much arctic ice would have a HUGE impact. Not only would sea level rise by roughly 20 feet, the ice would no longer be reflecting sunlight back into space, warming the planet even faster. We contacted Schatz's office, which directed us to two sources. The first was a web page from the National Snow & Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado, Boulder, which tracks melting on a daily basis. It says, ""Greenland’s surface melting in 2012 was intense, far in excess of any earlier year in the satellite record since 1979. In July 2012, a very unusual weather event occurred. For a few days, 97% of the entire ice sheet indicated surface melting."" The estimate comes from satellite measurements. We also found a NASA web page that reported that in July 2012, ""an estimated 97 percent of the ice sheet surface had thawed by July 12."" So the key word in each case is ""surface."" The melting the satellites tracked was at and near the surface, often to a depth of no more than an inch. The ice sheet itself never thawed, or came close to thawing. Dorothy Hall, a senior scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, whose examination of the event is to be published in Geophysical Research Letters, said unusually warm temperatures that month did produce some unusual melting, but it didn't wipe out most of the ice sheet. ""Sen. Schatz's statement is very misleading,"" she said in an email, noting that her estimate of surface melt is even higher. ""The correct statement would be that approximately 99% of the surface of the Greenland ice sheet experienced some melt during a two-day period in July of 2012. In fact most of the ice sheet surface re-froze within hours or days of the big melt event."" Hall said that the last time that much surface ice temporarily melted was about a century ago. ""If that begins to happen more frequently, that is a red flag,"" she said. At the highest elevations, ""the surface will only melt a few centimeters for a few minutes or hours, so none of that liquid water can run off and contribute to sea level rise,"" she said in an interview. The thaw was deeper and more extensive at lower altitudes, producing some ponds and runoff, but even in those cases, much of the water re-froze, although quite a bit made its way to the ocean to contribute to sea level rise. How much of the ice sheet was actually lost? Satellite data show that Greenland lost about 325 billion metric tons of ice that month, enough to raise sea level by nearly a millimeter. That's a lot. Typically, 340 billion metric tons are lost in a full year, according to climate researcher Jason Box of the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland. However, the amount of ice lost was only about 0.01 percent of the nearly 3 million billion tons of ice locked in the sheet. When we asked Schatz's office if the senator misspoke, spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa stood by his comment. ""The senator said that 97 percent of the ice sheet thawed . . . which means to become soft, and does not mean vanish. He also specifically said 'for several days in July of 2012,' so that it would be clear that he was not implying that the ice vanished forever. To suggest that the senator said it disappeared is inaccurate."" Thomas Mote, a geographer at the University of Georgia, says it's a ""common mistake"" to confuse the thawing of the surface ice with the thawing of the ice sheet. ""Certainly we did not lose 97 percent of the ice. Sea levels would quickly go up 20 feet,"" he said. ""We would notice that pretty quickly."" Our ruling Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz said: ""For several days in July of 2012, Greenland surface ice cover melted more than at any time in 30 years of satellite observation. During that month, an estimated 97 percent of the ice sheet thawed."" His first sentence is correct. Because he also prefaced his comment by asserting that ""glaciers continue to retreat"" and the ice sheet ""provides a stark example of the rapid recession of the world's ice,"" his contention that  ""97 percent of the ice sheet thawed,"" could easily be misinterpreted as referring to the whole ice sheet",Half True,"August 5, 2013"
"The ""most realistic estimates"" for jobs created by Keystone XL are ""maybe 2,000 jobs during the construction of the pipeline.""","The Keystone XL pipeline that would carry oil from Alberta, Canada, to refineries on the Texas Gulf coast presents President Barack Obama with no easy choice. While officially, the final decision to block or approve it is in the hands of the State Department, politically, the plan pits two key Democratic constituencies against each other, environmentalists and organized labor. For the first group, extracting petroleum from Canadian tar sands is a climate change disaster. For the unions, the project means jobs. Fresh off a speech that underscored the need to restore America’s middle class, Obama talked about the steps that lie ahead for the 875-mile link between the Canadian border and a distribution hub in Nebraska. The central question, he said in an interview with the New York Times, is whether this would ""significantly contribute to carbon in our atmosphere."" As for jobs, the president went out of his way to downplay them. In the big picture, they were but a ""blip"", as the president put it. ""Republicans have said that this would be a big jobs generator. There is no evidence that that’s true,"" Obama said. ""Any reporter who is looking at the facts would take the time to confirm that the most realistic estimates are this might create maybe 2,000 jobs during the construction of the pipeline -- which might take a year or two -- and then after that we’re talking about somewhere between 50 and 100 jobs in a economy of 150 million working people."" There’s been a running battle over jobs and the Keystone XL. We’ve checked claims that it would employ as many as 20,000 workers. We rated that False; even the company behind the pipeline backed away from that number. To be clear, there are all sorts of complications when it comes to predicting how many jobs a complex, two-year project will generate. There are the direct construction jobs; there’s indirect employment at companies that provide the materials and services related to the work; and then there’s the really indirect effect that comes when money is pumped into an economy and people buy food and pay rent and so on. But out of all the numbers bruited about, the president’s seemed particularly low. We asked the White House for evidence to support the claim. All they offered was a statement from spokesman Josh Earnest during a press briefing. ""There are a range of estimates out there about the economic impact of the pipeline,"" Earnest said. ""What the president is interested in doing is draining the politics out of this debate and evaluating this project on the merits."" During the New York Times interview, the president invited reporters to use the most realistic estimates. So we went to the State Department’s lengthy environmental impact statement on the project that came out in March. In that report, the lowest estimate for jobs directly tied to construction was 3,900 jobs a year. That number came after analysts wrestled with the stop-and-start nature of construction work and converted the jobs to a yearly estimate. ""Approximately 10,000 construction workers engaged for 4-to 8-month seasonal construction periods (approximately 5,000 to 6,000 per construction period) would be required to complete the proposed project. When expressed as average annual employment, this equates to approximately 3,900 jobs."" The analysis noted that 90 percent of those jobs would come from ""a unique national labor force that is highly specialized in pipeline construction techniques."" It also confirmed that there would be few long-term jobs, something on the order of 35. The largest jobs number in the State Department report is an annual average of 42,100, but that includes part-time jobs and folds in the ripple effects as spending moves through the economy, measured over two years. The further out from the immediate project the analysis moves, the less certain the results. The report said these jobs would amount to 0.02 percent of total American employment, adding some weight to the president’s characterization of the impact on the overall jobs picture. The North American Building Trades Union said it was disappointed with Obama’s words and pressed him to let the pipeline move forward. ""So that workers and their families can share in the economic recovery he is touting,"" said union president Sean McGarvey. ""The president should look to his own State Department’s findings that there will be meaningful job creation."" We looked at the website of the Sierra Club, one of the leading environmental groups opposed to the pipeline, and they used the State Department’s 3,900 annual number. The only place we found anything close to the president’s figure was at the Cornell School of Industrial and Labor Relations Global Labor Institute. Assistant director Lara Skinner co-wrote a report highly critical of the pipeline. Skinner argued that the 3,900 covered employment for two years and that it should be divided in half. ""That's where the 2,000 job figure comes from,"" Skinner said. However, if that is what the State Department had meant, the White House could have easily referred to it to support the president’s claim. Our ruling Obama said the Keystone XL pipeline might produce about 2,000 jobs during construction, based on the most reliable estimates. The White House provided no supporting evidence and the administration’s own State Department predicted that while the pipeline would produce few permanent jobs, the construction process itself would create nearly twice as many jobs as the president said",False,"July 31, 2013"
"""Every single month since 1985 has been warmer than the historic average. All 12 of the warmest years on record have come in the last 15 years.""","U.S. Senate candidate Rush Holt set off a political firestorm last week with these three words tucked into a campaign ad about the dangers of climate change: ""Millions will die."" Holt, a Democratic congressman, defended that claim in the face of criticism from Republican U.S. Senate candidate Steve Lonegan, who dismissed Holt’s climate change assertions as ""silly hysteria."" In the Aug. 13 Democratic primary, Holt is running against Newark Mayor Cory Booker, U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone (D-6th Dist.) and Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver (D-Essex) to fill the U.S. Senate seat previously held by the late Frank Lautenberg. PolitiFact New Jersey cannot fact-check the ""millions will die"" claim -- since it’s a prediction -- but another statement made by Holt earlier in the July 22 campaign ad caught our attention. ""Every single month since 1985 has been warmer than the historic average,"" Holt (D-12th Dist.) said. ""All 12 of the warmest years on record have come in the last 15 years."" Those statements are accurate, according to data released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. First, let’s address the first part about monthly temperatures. Referring to global temperatures -- meaning land and ocean surfaces combined -- Jessica Blunden, a climate scientist with the NOAA, confirmed in a series of e-mails that ""since February 1985, every month has been warmer than the average of that month."" The NOAA compares each month’s global temperature against the average for that respective month for the period between 1901 and 2000, Blunden said. Since February 1985, the global temperature for every month has been above its 20th Century average, she said. For instance, the NOAA found that the global temperature in June was 1.15 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the average of all the months of June between 1901 and 2000. That measurement marked ""the 37th consecutive June and 340th consecutive month—that’s a total of more than 28 years—with a global temperature above the 20th-century average,"" according to a summary of the NOAA’s latest climate report. On the second point, it turns out that Holt's figure of the 12 warmest years on record occurring in the last 15 years was actually a conservative estimate. Based on NOAA data, the last 15 years -- from 1998 to 2012 -- have included the 14 hottest years on record since 1880 for global temperatures. The NOAA estimates that the hottest year was 2010. Using a different methodology, NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies estimates that the last 15 years have included the 13 hottest years since 1880 for global temperatures. In a statistical tie, either 2010 or 2005 may be considered the warmest year on record, according to Reto Ruedy, a climate scientist with the institute. The institute has said 2012 was the ninth warmest year on record, while the NOAA estimates that 2012 was the tenth hottest year. ""The record dates back to 1880 because that is when there were enough meteorological stations around the world to provide global temperature data,"" according to a news release on the institute’s website. Our ruling In a campaign ad where he claimed ""millions will die"" from climate change, Holt cited two statistics about monthly and annual global temperatures. ""Every single month since 1985 has been warmer than the historic average,"" Holt said. ""All 12 of the warmest years on record have come in the last 15 years."" Both of those statistics are backed up by data released by scientists at the NOAA and NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. The global temperature in every month since February 1985 has been above the 20th Century average for its respective month, according to the NOAA. As for the warmest years on record, NOAA scientists estimate that the last 15 years have included the 14 hottest years and NASA scientists have said that same time period included the 13 hottest years",True,"July 28, 2013"
"The ocean is now ""much more acidic . . . than it has been for many millions of years.""","Former Vice President Al Gore, now a crusader against climate change, argues that the continued release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is going to do more than just raise temperatures. It's going to alter the balance of sea life by changing the acidity of the oceans. During a June 11 keynote address at U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse's 4th Annual Rhode Island Energy & Environmental Leaders Day, Gore said ocean acidification has been characterized as the evil twin of global warming. The process ""disrupts ocean chemistry,"" he said. Ocean water is still more base than acid on the pH scale, ""but it's much more acidic, more than it has been for many millions of years."" That's important, he said, because, ""This disrupts the process by which shells are formed, not only for shellfish but also for the little critters, the zooplankton, the little tiny critters at the base of the ocean food chain. They have little thin shells. That's being disrupted now."" On Sunday, we checked a similar claim from Whitehouse, who said the acidity of the oceans had increased 30 percent since the industrial age. We ruled that Mostly True. We were equally interested in Gore's assessment of the problem over a much longer span. Is the ocean currently ""much more acidic"" than it has been for ""many millions of years?"" As we outlined in our examination of Whitehouse’s claim, acidity is measured on the pH scale. The lower the number, the greater the acid level. Currently, the oceans have a pH of about 8.1. That's more acidic than it was before the Industrial Revolution, when the level was 8.2. When we contacted Gore's office, spokeswoman Betsy McManus directed us to an ocean acidification fact sheet from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. She highlighted this statement, which starts out by describing that scientists measure ocean pH in ancient times by using telltale chemical signatures in tiny creatures buried in ocean sediment: ""Additional geochemical evidence and modeling provide strong evidence that the average surface ocean pH has not been much lower than about 8.2 for millions of years."" That seems far less extreme than Gore's statement that the ocean is much more acidic than it has been for many millions of years. So we contacted several oceanographers to get data from the geologic record, where ocean pH is inferred from a variety of methods using cores taken from ancient ice and deep sea sediment. Just as you can get different temperature readings at the same time if you have thermometers in different locations, the pH measurements in any particular era and from cores taken from different locations can vary. If you look at individual data points, you don't have to go back ""many millions of years"" to find ocean levels as acidic as today. A 2009 study in the journal Science that went back 2.1 million years by analyzing the shells of single-celled plankton buried off the west coast of Africa, found that while the pH averaged around 8.2 during that period, there were a few points -- 100,000 and 900,000 years ago -- when the surface ocean pH hit 8.1, where it is today. But Barbel Honisch, a geochemist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and chief author of the Science paper, cautioned that ""the uncertainty in the data points is very large."" She said she has more confidence in data published a year later in Earth and Planetary Science Letters, which went back five million years, because it dovetails with other evidence. That study suggested that pH levels dropped to between 8.0 and 8.1 about 3 million to 4 million years ago. ""If you go back 4 million years, you're there,"" Honisch said, adding that other data support that conclusion as well. ""The ocean was more acidic or just as acidic as it is now."" Again, that's not ""many millions of years."" Acid levels also seemed to rise to today's level around 15 million to 16 million years ago, according to Honisch. And Andrew Dickson, an oceanographer at the University of California San Diego, said, ""Once we go back beyond about 23 million years, the average surface ocean pH is lower than today,"" he said. Another Science paper by Honisch and her colleagues, this one from 2012, looked at a broad array of evidence in 10-million-year blocks. Beginning 10 million years ago, acid levels gradually grew until the pH dropped to about 7.5 110 million years ago. That's five times more acidic than today's oceans. The climate experts we spoke with stressed that it's important to put this in perspective. Changes in pH typically occur over millions of years, giving life forms -- whose biology can be thrown akilter by a small change in pH -- time to adapt. Scientists fear that today's shift will come so rapidly, organisms won't be able to compensate, and many species will simply die off. It would have been more accurate to say, said Honisch, ""The ocean is acidifying faster today than it has in millions of years."" Our ruling Former Vice President Al Gore said the ocean today ""is much more acidic, more than it has been for many millions of years."" It's clear that the ocean is more acidic than it was before the Industrial Revolution. It's also clear that many millions of years ago it was much more acidic. But the best estimates suggest that the oceans reached levels of acidity comparable to today’s levels sometime between about 900,000 years ago and 3 million to 4 million years ago -- far more recently than the ""many millions of years"" ago that Gore suggested. ""If I had one of your meters, this would be halfway up,"" said Dickson, one of our experts on ocean acidification",Half True,"July 22, 2013"
"The oceans ""have become 30 percent more acidic.""","Most people have heard about what will happen if humans keep pumping large amounts of carbon dioxide into the air as we burn more fossil fuels, including warmer temperatures, melting polar caps, rising sea levels, stronger storms and big changes in the types of plants and animals that can survive and thrive in particular regions of the world. ""But wait,"" as an evil TV pitchman might gleefully declare, ""there's more."" On June 12, 2013, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, took to floor of the Senate for one of his regular speeches about the impact of pollution on Earth's climate. This time he focused on a lesser-publicized problem -- the oceans are becoming more acidic. ""Our oceans face unprecedented challenges from climate change and carbon pollution,"" he said. ""Oceans have absorbed more than 550 billion tons of our carbon pollution. As a result, they have become 30 percent more acidic. That is a measurement. That is not a theory."" Thirty percent more acidic? Our first question was: ""Is it true?"" Our second was: ""If so, what does that mean?"" When most people think of measuring acidity, they think of pH, the scale that runs from 0 to 14. (Think back to your school days and the little strips of paper that changed color depending on whether a substance was an acid or a base.) ""So,"" you might ask, ""has the pH of the ocean shifted a few points?"" Not at all. The pH scale is not a straight-line measure like a yardstick. It's a logarithmic scale, where a one point drop would make a substance 10 times more acidic. (What you're really measuring is the number of hydrogen ions, which determine how acidic something is.) Whitehouse's office directed us to several sources -- and we found our own -- reporting that since the mid-18th century, when air pollution became more prevalent, the pH of surface seawater has gone from about 8.2 to about 8.1. (That's a rise in acidity, but sea water would have to drop below 7.0 before it could be officially classified as an acid.) Lowering the pH by a tenth of a point translates to a 26-percent rise in hydrogen ion concentration, but some of those science sources say the increase is actually closer to 30 percent. The pH scale has been around only since 1909. How do we know what the pH was like in the 1800s or earlier? The oceanographers we consulted told us basic chemistry provides the answer. Seawater absorbs air, including carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide interacts with the water to make the ocean more acidic. Researchers have good measurements directly comparing carbon dioxide and pH dating to 1989. They show that surface ocean acidity has risen as carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have risen, just as expected. To go further back in time, scientists have measured the carbon dioxide concentrations in tiny bubbles of air trapped in ice found in places such as Greenland and Antarctica. Those ice cores show that, until the 1850s, the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere had not risen above 280 parts per million for most of the last million years or so. But in the past century and a half, they’ve been rising steadily, causing an increase in ocean acidity. Today, those carbon dioxide levels have occasionally passed 400 parts per million. ""It's been mostly in the last 100 years,"" said Steve D'Hondt, an oceanography professor at the University of Rhode Island. One other point. The acidity of the entire ocean hasn't changed by the amount Whitehouse citied. The chemical composition of deeper layers shifts much more gradually. ""It's been a long time since the deep ocean touched the atmosphere,"" said Andrew Dickson of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, at the University of California-San Diego. ""So it's not true of the ocean as a whole. It's only true of the surface layer."" That leads us to our second question: what does it mean? Because the effects of acidification are currently restricted to the upper 600-1,600 feet of the ocean, where most of the life is found, there's serious concern that small changes in pH will have a big -- and not very healthy -- effect on many ocean species, although some may be unaffected. Earth's oceans have been much more acidic in the past -- 110 million years ago the oceans were 400 percent (five times) more acidic. But most of those changes developed over millions of years, giving organisms time to evolve and adapt to the shift. The current rise in acidity is rapid. Said University of Rhode Island oceanographer Arthur Spivack, ""We already have a measurable change in ocean pH and we're going into a period where there will be a substantial change."" Our ruling U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said the oceans ""have become 30 percent more acidic."" He is correct if you look at the increase in the concentration of hydrogen ions since the 1850s in the upper layers of the ocean, where most sea life thrives. We also note that he's describing the change using a measure that heightens the drama for the casual listener. But regardless of how it is characterized, that change is cause for concern if it harms ocean creatures sensitive to changes in pH. On the other hand, the deeper ocean has not seen a 30-percent increase",Mostly True,"July 21, 2013"
"""Texas ranks: #1 in worker deaths, #1 carbon emissions, #50 in high school graduates, #50 in funding for mental health patients.""","A ""Rick Perry 2016"" image popped up on Facebook accompanied by warnings about the state he’s led since late 2000: ""Texas ranks: #1 in worker deaths, #1 carbon emissions, #50 in high school graduates, #50 in funding for mental health patients."" The June 13, 2013, post by the Everlasting GOP Stoppers, which also has a web page highlighting political items, was accompanied by a message signed ""Veruca"": ""True. Google it."" Referring to the Republican governor’s possibly renewed presidential aspirations, the comment closed: ""Just think if he makes good on his threat to run again, he can do for the whole country what he's done for Texas."" Mindful that we’ve previously explored claims about each of these topics, we asked the Everlasting GOP Stoppers, whose posts play off of the novel and movie ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" how it reached its Texas rankings. Worker deaths ""Veruca Salt"" (who did not provide her real name), a co-founder of the group, replied via Facebook message and pointed out an April 1, 2013, commentary by a state legislator, a Sept. 15, 2012, Dallas Morning News news article and a Sept. 21, 2011, news release from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, each of them indicating that in 2010, Texas was tops in some kind of worker fatalities. The commentary by Rep. Armando Walle, D-Houston, said: ""Texas still leads the country in the rate of construction worker fatalities."" The Sept. 15, 2012, News’ story said that Texas led the nation with 461 total worker deaths in 2010, a tally attributed to the bureau, whose news release said Texas had 456 ""fatal work injuries"" in 2010, according to a preliminary count, which was down 26 from 2009. Some 134 of the deaths were highway-related, according to the release, with workplace homicides and falls accounting for 48 and 45 deaths, respectively. The release does not say Texas led the nation in workplace deaths. In May 2013, we rated as Half True a claim that Texas leads the nation in fatal industrial accidents. Drawing on statistics compiled by the federal bureau, we found that according to preliminary figures for 2011, Texas ranked No. 1 in five of six types of event or exposure tabbed by Austin advocate Jim Marston as  ""industrial accident categories"" plus the transportation category. California led in deaths caused by violence and other injuries by persons or animals. Texas, the nation’s second-most populous state, had 18 of the nation’s 143 work fatalities attributed to fires and explosions; 67 of the total 666 from falls, slips and trips; 43 of the 401 caused by exposure to harmful substances or environments; and 66 of 708 deaths resulting from contact with objects and other equipment. California had the second-most in each of the four categories: 9, 60, 36 and 50 deaths, respectively. Third in fires/explosions was Tennessee with 10; third in falls and slips was New York with 39; third in harmful exposure was Florida with 27; and New York was third in object/equipment contact deaths at 34. We looked at preliminary data for 2003 through 2010 and found Texas led those categories about 88 percent of the time. Seeking a way to account for population differences among states, we took each state’s 2011 raw numbers of deaths in the four categories Marston tabbed, added them together, then divided by the average number of workers employed in the state in 2011 per the bureau. Texas ranked 18th, with a rate of 1.7 such deaths per 100,000 workers. Observing that the five states with the ""worst"" rates all employed fewer than 1 million people in 2011, we checked to see how Texas fared among states employing more than 1 million. The answer: 10th place. ""Worst"" among the states were Montana (3.4 deaths per 100,000 workers), North Dakota (3.3), West Virginia (3), Alaska (3) and New Mexico (2.8). ""Worst"" among states with more than 1 million employed were Arkansas (2.6), Louisiana (2.3), Kansas (2.3), Missouri (2.1) and Kentucky (2). During our look into the Everlasting GOP Stoppers’ claim, a bureau spokeswoman, Cheryl Abbot, responded to our inquiry about worker deaths in general by emailing us a federal document showing 2011 workplace fatality rates state by state. That year, according to the document, Texas had a rate of 4 fatal occupational injuries per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers. That tied the state for 22nd with Alabama. North Dakota ranked first with a fatality rate of 12.4, according to the document, with Wyoming second (11.6) followed by Montana (11.2), Alaska (11.1), Arkansas (8.0), South Dakota (6.7) and New Mexico (6.6). Among the 10 most populous states, Texas ranked second to Ohio, which had a 5.5 fatality rate, according to the document. Carbon emissions ""Salt"" pointed us toward a May 14, 2013, blog post in a trade publication, Environmental Leader, stating: ""Texas still led the U.S. states in CO2 emissions from energy with 663 million metric tons in 2010, followed by California and Pennsylvania."" The post, like a May 29, 2013, online post by the Environmental Defense Fund, attributed the conclusion to figures posted by the federal Energy Information Administration. The post said too, however, that Wyoming had the nation’s greatest per-resident emissions, 118.5 metric tons per capita. In February 2013, we found a similar contrast; by far, Texas topped other states in carbon emissions except when those emissions were adjusted for population. A Jan. 12, 2012, Houston Chronicle news article said that according to federal data released that day, Texas was releasing far more greenhouse gases into the air than any other state. The story continued: ""Texas' coal-fired power plants and oil refineries generated 294 million tons of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases in 2010, more than the next two states – Pennsylvania and Florida – combined, the data show."" The story said the Environmental Protection Agency released the data from the largest industrial sources across the country for the first time as part of a broader effort to reduce emissions linked to global warming. It said the agency ""collected data from more than 6,700 industrial facilities that release at least 25,000 tons of greenhouse gases into the air a year. The threshold is comparable to the emissions from burning 131 railcars of coal, the EPA said.""   To our inquiries at that time, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the Sierra Club in Texas each guided us to even more recent EPA data on industrial emissions of greenhouse gases, the primary driver of climate change, the federal agency says. And on the agency’s website, it’s possible to check on each state’s industrial emissions of eight gases, among them carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons. According to the posted information, Texas industrial facilities in 2011 emitted 391 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, mainly produced from the burning of fossil fuels. The database indicates that industrial CO2 emissions in other populous states were lower: California (95 million metric tons); New York (44); Florida (123); Illinois (41); Pennsylvania (141): Ohio (142); Michigan (89); Georgia (82); North Carolina (66); and New Jersey (23). Louisiana, on the Gulf Coast like Texas, had 132 million metric tons of CO2 emissions, according to the agency. It’s no surprise, perhaps, that Texas plants make the state No. 1 in industrial carbon dioxide emissions. Neil Carman, who directs the Clean Air program for the Sierra Club’s Lone Star chapter, told us by email: ""Realize that Texas has more large oil refineries, major chemical and petrochemical plants, hundreds of natural gas processing plants, Portland cement kilns, carbon black plants, etc. than any other state because of the strength of the oil & gas industry and the large geographical size and population base as well."" Carman’s comment underscored a hitch in the federal information. The data does not reflect total gases emitted in each state--just those attributed to industrial facilities. Yet Al Armendariz of the Sierra Club guided us to a spreadsheet prepared by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, based on its analysis of emissions from the consumption of fossil fuels, estimating that in 2010, Texas had 653 million metric tons of CO2 emissions. California placed a distant second, at 370 million metric tons, and Pennsylvania was third, at 257 million metric tons. So, Texas has been No. 1 in total CO2 emissions, though it would have tied for 13th if each state’s emissions were adjusted for its population.In per-capita emissions, less populous states led the nation, topped by Wyoming (108 metric tons per capita); North Dakota (76); Alaska (56); Louisiana (50); Montana (36); Kentucky (35); Indiana (34); Iowa (30); Alabama and New Mexico (28); Nebraska and Oklahoma (27). Kansas and Texas each had 26 metric tons of CO2 emissions per resident. High school graduates On Texas ranking last in high school graduates, ""Salt"" cited the March 2013 edition of a report by a Texas House caucus, the Legislative Study Group, on how Texas ranks compared to other states. ""Texas is dead last in percentage of high school graduates,"" the report said, a conclusion attributed to the ""Texas Fact Book"" published in 2012 by the Legislative Budget Board, which said that in 2009, 79.9 percent of Texans had graduated from high school, placing the state 50th. By email, a staff spokesman for the budget board, John Barton, told us that ranking was based on the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2009 American Community Survey, which indicates Texas trailed Mississippi, at 80.4 percent, and California, 80.6 percent. More up-to-date information was available before the group made its post about Perry. In the bureau’s 2011 survey, Texas, Mississippi and California tied for last among the states, with 81.1 percent of adults having high school degrees. Louisiana was fourth, at 82.5 percent. We suppose the group’s Facebook post could be read as saying Texas is last in current high school graduation rates. That was not what we found in January 2013 when we rated as Mostly True a Perry claim that Texas graduation rates were at an all-time high and third-highest in the nation. Texas had tied with five states for the third-highest graduation rate in 2011, of 86 percent, we found. Then again, three states had higher rates, meaning Texas might better be described as fourth-ranked. Also, by another measure, comparing the number of graduates one year to students in ninth grade four years earlier, Texas remained among middling states for 2009-10, with a 79 percent completion rate. Mental health spending ""Salt"" offered news articles and blog posts from 2011 and 2012 indicating Texas ranked 50th in per-resident spending on mental health care. Most drew on an annual analysis by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. In February 2013, we rated as Mostly True a claim that Texas is ""last in mental health expenditures,"" after noting that the foundation’s latest review indicated that another state spent less per resident than Texas in fiscal 2010, which in Texas ran through August 2010. Texas was last among the states in such per-capita spending in 2009, 2008 and 2007, according to Kaiser charts for those years, though the 2007 chart shows no available data for Hawaii. The latest comparison: In fiscal 2010, which in Texas ran through August 2010, Texas spent nearly $980 million total on mental health services, placing ninth nationally, according to a foundation chart. The state’s per-person spending of $38.99 placed the state 49th -- not last -- among the states. Idaho, with per-capita spending of $36.64, was 50th, with Maine No. 1 at per-capita spending of $346.92. The national average was $120.56. In raw dollars, then, Texas spent more on mental health services than 41 states. But in per-resident spending -- the better metric for comparing states --Texas ranked second-to-last to Idaho after trailing all other states for several years. Our ruling The Facebook post said: ""Texas ranks: #1 in worker deaths, #1 carbon emissions, #50 in high school graduates, #50 in funding for mental health patients."" This post takes things out of context by cherry-picking figures, in each case stressing the result that makes Texas look worst. Still, two of the declared ranks seem fairly solid. Texas tied with Mississippi in 2011 for the greatest share of adults lacking high school degrees and it was second to last in per-person mental health spending in 2010. In contrast, Texas ranked 22nd nationally in its 2011 worker fatality rate and while the state had the most carbon emissions in 2010, it would have tied for 13th if each state’s emissions were adjusted for its population",Half True,"July 19, 2013"
"Recent record-low water levels in Lake Michigan are evidence that global warming is leading to ""the evaporation of our Great Lakes.""","On the same day that President Barack Obama gave a major address on climate change, the second-ranking Senate Democrat, Dick Durbin of Illinois, gave a floor speech that drove the issue home for his constituents. ""I believe the environment is a challenge we must face head on,"" Durbin said on June 25, 2013. ""To ignore it is to ignore reality. Lake Michigan, when measured just a few months ago, was at its lowest depth in any measured time in recent history. What we are seeing in global warming is the evaporation of our Great Lakes."" A reader suggested we check out Durbin’s claim, so we will. The Great Lakes take in water through precipitation, runoff and inflow from upstream bodies of water; they lose it from evaporation or diversion. Both seasonal and longer-term cycles have caused fluctuations since the end of the Ice Age. Over the past 150 years, scientists say, water levels have varied within a relatively narrow, 2-meter range. But the past few decades have produced some important patterns. Lake levels were relatively high from the 1970s to the late 1990s, then fell swiftly in the late 1990s before settling in at a low, but fairly stable, level through today. Durbin is correct that water levels in Lake Michigan were lower in January 2013 than at any time since records began in 1918 -- a full 6 feet lower than the 1986 peak. This is causing worries about wildlife, shipping, recreation and tourism. Several factors tend to increase water loss: • Dredging. The removal of soil and rock to enable ships to pass can encourage lower water levels. Dredging projects going back to the 19th century are estimated to have lowered Lake Michigan by 16 inches, according to the International Joint Commission, a U.S.-Canada panel on boundary issues. • Erosion. Natural erosion since 1962 may have lowered water levels by an additional 3 to 5 inches, according to the commission. • Diversion. A diversion of Lake Michigan water to Chicago starting in 1900 is estimated to have lowered water levels by about 2 inches, but this has been more than balanced out by two diversions into Lake Superior, which feeds Lake Michigan. Dredging, erosion and diversion have affected today’s low levels by reducing the baseline level, but because there have been no major dredging projects in recent years, these factors have not contributed to recent fluctuations. Other factors more directly related to climate change, however, may have, specifically: • Low precipitation. In 2011 and 2012, the basin feeding the Great Lakes experienced mild winters, which produced lower-than-normal snowpacks, reducing a major source of incoming water in the spring. Dry summers can also provide too little incoming rain to keep levels high. • Higher evaporation. If it’s hot in the summer, water temperatures increase. Then, when cool, dry air comes in the fall, the lakes’ warmer water evaporates in greater quantities, lowering water levels. This can be exaggerated if precipitation levels are already low. Such conditions prevailed last year. • More limited ice cover. In winter, diminished ice cover can mean higher water temperatures, which in turn encourages evaporation. A 2012 study found that the Great Lakes have lost 71 percent of their ice cover since 1973. However, it gets complicated: Scientists say that greater evaporation in the fall can cool lakes, potentially increasing ice coverage the following winter. Durbin’s office pointed to these factors as support for the senator’s claim. ""Warmer weather, more severe droughts, higher water temperatures and greater evaporation are, in fact, leading to lower water levels,"" said Max Gleischman, a spokesman for Durbin. ""The lake has seen record-low water levels in recent years at the same time we’ve seen record drought conditions in the region. While temperature, water level and drought conditions have fluctuated over the years, the highs are getting higher and the lows are getting lower."" However, scientists we interviewed say Durbin’s claim is an oversimplification. ""Attribution of low lake levels to human-caused climate change is rather speculative at this time,"" said Brent M. Lofgren, a climatologist at the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Lofgren said it’s important to look at the pivotal period in the late 1990s. Levels declined suddenly, he said, and since then, have remained fairly steady. The record lows of early 2013, he said, amounted to ""a small downward excursion from the levels over the last decade and a half."" In fact, after hitting the low point, Lake Michigan saw a 9-inch rise in April -- the second highest monthly increase for April on record. In other words, the water level is still low, but it’s fluctuating, and it’s in roughly the same range it’s been since the late 1990s. This pattern of events doesn’t fit very well with existing models of global warming, which suppose a gradual rise in greenhouse gases, Lofgren said. A sudden change like the one experienced in the late 1990s -- followed by a decade and a half of fairly stable levels -- ""is particularly difficult to attribute to a gradual buildup of greenhouse gases,"" he said. In the meantime, Lofgren said, the modeling of how climate change could affect the Great Lakes in the future has recently undergone a rethinking. A new model developed by Lofgren for how climate changes affect the Great Lakes basin suggests potential water-level declines smaller than previous estimates. The previous consensus for Lake Michigan was a decline of between 10 and 44 inches. The new model suggests anywhere from a decline of 36 inches to a rise of 20 inches, and another recent study indicated losses of 24 inches or less. Why such a wide range of outcomes? It boils down to complexity. Both a 2012 study by the International Joint Commission and the Great Lakes Environmental Assessment and Mapping Project, an independent group, agreed that lower water levels are likelier in the future than higher levels, but they added that varying models leave considerable uncertainty about which outcome will result. ""Although climate experts expect evaporation to increase in the future, there is debate over whether or not the Great Lakes would see more precipitation under future climate change scenarios,"" said John Allis, chief of the Great Lakes Hydraulics and Hydrology Office at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Detroit district. Our ruling Durbin pointed to recent record-low water levels in Lake Michigan as evidence that global warming is leading to ""the evaporation of our Great Lakes."" Most scientists agree that recent patterns of precipitation, evaporation and ice cover suggest that climate change is affecting water levels in the Great Lakes. But over the long term, dredging and erosion have lowered water levels, and the sudden decline in the late 1990s, followed by a relatively stable decade and a half, doesn’t mesh with the presumed slow buildup of greenhouse gases. In addition, scientific models offer a wide range of possible impacts on water levels due to climate change, from decreases to increases",Half True,"June 28, 2013"
"""This president spends 30 times as much money on global warming research as he does on weather forecasting and warning.""","Freshman Rep. Jim Bridenstine, R-Okla., attracted some attention for a House floor speech on June 11, 2013, in which he said he’s ready to accept President Barack Obama’s ""apology"" for spending too much on climate change research. In his one-minute speech, Bridenstine -- whose state has been hard-hit by severe tornadoes in recent weeks -- expressed skepticism that human activity has historically caused either global warming or cooling. He went on to say the following: ""Here’s what we absolutely know. We know that Oklahoma will have tornadoes when the cold jet stream meets the warm gulf air. And we also know that this president spends 30 times as much money on global warming research as he does on weather forecasting and warning. For this gross misallocation, the people of Oklahoma are ready to accept the president’s apology, and I intend to submit legislation to fix this."" We wondered whether Bridenstine is right that Obama spends 30 times as much on global warming research as on weather forecasting and warning. Bridenstine’s office provided us with support for his claim. For the climate change figure, they used Obama’s fiscal year 2014 request for $2.7 billion for the U.S. Global Change Research Program, which cuts across 13 federal agencies. For the weather-forecasting figure, they used $81.6 million for weather and air chemistry research under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the parent agency of the National Weather Service. Comparing these two figures works out to a 33-to-1 ratio, in line with what Bridenstine said. But there are two key problems with this calculation. He didn’t specify that he was talking about weather research Bridenstine said that Obama ""spent more on ""weather forecasting and warning,"" not ""weather forecasting and warning research."" That’s just one word, but it makes a big difference, because the National Weather Service spends a whole lot more on operations -- ""forecasting and warning"" -- than it does on research. Obama’s National Weather Service budget request for 2014 was $1.05 billion, split about 90 percent for operations and research and 10 percent for construction and acquisition. That means the ratio between climate research and ""forecasting and warning"" would be about 2.7 to 1 -- far less than the 30-to-1 ratio Bridenstine cited. Bridenstine’s office vigorously disagreed with this interpretation, arguing that the ""whole topic"" of his speech was research, as is the subject of his forthcoming legislation. However, Bridenstine’s words didn’t make clear that he’s making a comparison only to weather research. It sounds like he’s comparing climate change research to weather ""forecasting and warning."" Indeed, the only time he said the word ""research"" in the brief speech was in relation to climate change. Did Bridenstine count all of the weather research he could have? Now, for the sake of argument, let’s look at Bridenstine’s claim as if he had said ""forecasting and warning research."" Is his comparison valid? Experts we checked with didn’t have any quibbles with his $2.7 billion figure for climate change. But they did say he’s overlooking some weather research funding being conducted by agencies other than the National Weather Service or its parent, NOAA. One expert pointed us to a document issued by a federal committee that is charged with ensuring ""the effective use of federal meteorological resources"" by coordinating needs among various agencies. One of the document’s tables summarizes meteorological ""research and development costs by budget category"" for the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Homeland Security, Interior and Transportation, plus the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. This table offers $1.25 billion as the total figure for federal meteorological research and development in 2013. If we were to use this figure, then the money spent on climate change research would be slightly more than twice as big. That’s still a gap, but it’s well below a ratio of 30 to 1. Bridenstine’s office counters that it’s not fair to use this figure for computing the ratio. They noted that some categories might be far from helpful in domestic weather forecasting, such as Defense Department projects focused on weather overseas. And they noted, correctly, that about $900 million of the $1.25 billion figure falls under NASA, and that some of the projects NASA is involved in addresses, according to the report, ""biodiversity, cryospheric science, remote sensing of water quality, atmospheric composition, and interdisciplinary science,"" as well as ""global and regional climate change"" -- topics far afield from weather forecasting. Still, NASA has a long record of working with, and covering some of the costs for, the National Weather Service, particularly on pricey satellite programs. For instance, the GPM Core Observatory is in the final stages of testing at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, with a launch planned for 2014. This project is designed to provide ""near-real-time"" data on precipitation, and one of its goals is ""improved weather forecasting."" Other collaborative programs between NASA and NOAA include the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite and Polar Operational Environmental Satellite, which will offer ""real-time weather data for use in short-term weather forecasting,"" and the Joint Polar Satellite System, which is designed to enable scientists to ""better predict medium- and long-term weather."" When we asked meteorological experts, most said Bridenstine’s ratio was at least somewhat misleading. For one thing, it’s hard to draw clear lines between climate and weather research and to remove all sources of overlap from the comparison. For instance, research into El Nino events, which have a big impact on localized weather, could be categorized as either ""climate"" or ""weather."" ""Substantial overlap exists in weather forecasting and climate research,"" said Eric D. Maloney, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University. ""One hot topic in our field at the moment is ‘seamless’ predictions that link weather and climate. This has applications for the prediction of hurricane activity in the Atlantic on seasonal and sub-seasonal timescales."" Rob Jackson, an environmental scientist at Duke University, called Bridenstine’s comparison ""silly."" ""The number for climate change research combines a score of federal agencies, all of them pooled together,"" he said. ""The number for weather forecasting and warning is for one and only one program within one federal agency. It’s a selective distortion of actual spending."" Regardless of what ratio you ultimately settle on, Iowa State University meteorologist William Gallus said Bridenstine does deserve credit for putting his finger on an issue that ""simmers behind the scenes in my profession"" -- the idea that climate-change funding has elbowed out weather forecasting funding. In particular, he said weather scientists sometimes chafe at the computing resources available to climate-change scientists. While this discrepancy may have roots in the greater computational power needed to model the long-term global climate, he added that meteorologists ""could really benefit from more powerful computers that allow us to run the models with far finer resolution to actually be able to simulate the tornadoes themselves."" Our ruling Bridenstine said Obama ""spends 30 times as much money on global warming research as he does on weather forecasting and warning."" We think the most obvious way to read his words is to compare climate-change research funding with dollars spent on ""weather forecasting and warning,"" which produces a 2.7-to-1 ratio. However, even if you accept Bridenstine’s argument that he meant to compare it to ""weather forecasting and warning research,"" the ratio is still not near 30 to 1. Bridenstine does have a point that climate change research exceeds weather forecasting expenditures, but he’s overstated the discrepancy",Mostly False,"June 14, 2013"
"Says 
""With nearly 75 percent of Americans supportive of the construction of the pipeline, Schrader needs to explain to Oregon families why he voted against this needed project.""","The communications office of the National Republican Congressional Committee isn’t letting up on Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore. It’s recently peppered him with criticism over the sequester and President Barack Obama’s health care overhaul. This time, the issue is construction of a controversial pipeline that would carry crude oil from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast for refinement.   A May 23, 2013, press release targeted Schrader for voting against H.R. 3, a bill that would allow TransCanada to start building the Keystone XL Pipeline without approval from President Barack Obama. Specifically, the legislation skips further environmental review and removes barriers to construction.   ""With nearly 75 percent of Americans supportive of the construction of the pipeline, Schrader needs to explain to Oregon families why he voted against this needed project,"" the release states.   Three-quarters of Americans want this project to happen? We know surveys can sometimes use scurrilous, squirrelly language, so we thought we’d take a look-see.  Plus, while Schrader is a veterinarian who loves animals, the man is no tree-hugging environmentalist. Does he oppose construction?   Let’s tackle the 75 percent statistic first. The NRCC relies on a survey conducted by Nanos Research that was the subject of an April 2013 news report in the Wall Street Journal.   Here’s the survey question: Based on what you have heard about the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline between Canada and the U.S., do you support, somewhat support, somewhat oppose or oppose the US/Canadian government approving the project?   Of Americans, 52 percent said they support the project and 22 percent said they somewhat support it.   Nanos, a respected independent polling firm, isn’t the only one to find that a majority of respondents in the United States support construction. An April 2013 Pew Research poll found 66 percent in favor with 23 percent opposed. The poll found broader support among Republicans and independents; Democrats are more divided.   We checked with Daniel Kessler, a media campaigner with 350.org, which opposes Keystone. The Nanos polling question looked sound to him, although he wanted to remind readers that other surveys show high support for clean energy alternatives and efforts to combat global warming.   Now, let’s address the second part of the statement. As we stated earlier, H.R. 3 eliminates the need for White House approval to start the project.   It’s undisputed that Schrader voted against the bill. Nineteen House Democrats joined majority Republicans to send the bill to the Senate, where it sits. No House Democrat from Oregon voted for the legislation. In fact, the NRCC targeted a number of Democrats with the same press release, including Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore.   A spokesman for Schrader said the congressman supports construction in principle, just not the way Republicans are going about it. ""To say that he does not support the construction on the pipeline is false,"" wrote spokesman Cody Tucker in an email to PolitiFact Oregon.   Annie Clark with the NRCC disagrees. She cited four other times where Schrader voted against construction. ""Schrader voted against constructing or expediting construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline every chance he had,"" she wrote to PolitiFact Oregon.   We checked his other votes. The legislation sought to force Obama to act or bypassed him altogether in approving Keystone. Loads of House Democrats voted against the bills.   Schrader did vote against H.R. 3, which eliminates further regulatory hurdles, eliminates presidential input and essentially gives congressional go-ahead for construction. This statement by itself we would rate Half True.   It is partially accurate in that Schrader did vote against the legislation, which authorizes the project. But it is missing significant details in that Schrader supports construction in principle, just not this particular way to get there",True,"June 1, 2013"
"A bill to advance the Keystone XL Pipeline ""is an earmark"" under House rules.","Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., recently took an unusual approach to opposing the Keystone XL pipeline, a 1,700-mile project to bring heavy crude from Canada’s oil-rich tar sands to the Gulf of Mexico. He says it’s an earmark, and earmarks aren’t in line with current House rules. ""The Keystone XL Pipeline deal is an earmark to a foreign corporation, plain and simple,"" Grayson said in a news release. ""House Republicans claim to have been incredibly keen on ridding our legislative system of congressional earmarks — yet here they are — hypocritically sneaking one in for a foreign corporation. They seem to believe that the ‘no earmarks’ rule does not apply to them. That’s just unacceptable."" For years, environmentalists have battled pipeline supporters over the construction of the new pipeline. This year, supporters turned to the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives to essentially waive a variety of regulatory hurdles that have so far delayed the project’s groundbreaking. A bill, H.R. 3, would effectively sidestep the key governmental reviews delaying the project, which is to be built by TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, L.P., a Canadian company. H.R. 3 declares that a presidential permit is not required to advance the project. It also clears the project under the the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act, the Mineral Leasing Act, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, among other laws; and prevents the Environmental Protection Agency Administrator from blocking the project. On May 21, 2013, as H.R. 3 was moving toward a vote in the House, Grayson wrote a letter to House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, in which he argued that the bill was an earmark. We were intrigued by Grayson’s argument and wanted to look in detail at whether the Keystone project fit the definition of an earmark. What is an earmark? Generally speaking, an earmark is a requirement that money approved by Congress be spent in a specific way at the request of a lawmaker. Critics say earmarks serve the interest of a particular congressional district or constituent group rather than the national good. That's why congressional Republicans -- and President Barack Obama -- have promised to curb their use, with some degree of success. To make his case that H.R. 3 was an earmark, Grayson pointed to the section of the House’s rules that define what constitutes an earmark. House rules are written by the chamber’s majority party every two years and approved, typically on a party-line vote, when a new Congress is sworn in. House rules do not have the force of law, but they are binding for the procedures used in the chamber. The current version of the House rules says earmarks are a specific authorization of spending, targeted to a specific purpose or place, and made without a competitive award process. Here’s the exact definition: ""For the purpose of this clause, the term ‘congressional earmark’ means a provision or report language included primarily at the request of a Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, or Senator providing, authorizing or recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget authority, credit authority, or other spending authority for a contract, loan, loan guarantee, grant, loan authority, or other expenditure with or to an entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality or Congressional district, other than through a statutory or administrative formula-driven or competitive award process."" To sharpen his case to Boehner, Grayson streamlined this language by removing some of the extra words. Grayson’s shortened earmark definition was: ""a provision … included primarily at the request of a Member ... providing (or) authorizing … a .. grant ... to an entity … other than through a statutory or administrative … or competitive award process."" H.R. 3, Grayson wrote, provides a special benefit, ""outside of established statutory, administrative or competitive award processes, and it does so to only one entity -- explicitly named in this bill, ‘TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, L.P.’"" Grayson went on to argue that the ""requirement that this provision be included ‘primarily at the request of a Member’ is surely satisfied by the act of a Member drafting and offering this bill. It was the conscious choice of a Member from the state of Nebraska to offer this legislation, as well as explicitly mention Nebraska or Nebraskans six separate times, while no other state receives a single mention."" We checked with several experts on House procedure to see what they thought of Grayson’s argument. They were not convinced. They said their concerns go beyond H.R. 3’s superficial differences with classic earmarks, though it has some of those, too. Typically, earmarks are narrow provisions of larger bills inserted and supported by a small number of lawmakers and advancing a highly localized purpose, such as a local road or construction project. By contrast, H.R. 3 is a stand-alone bill, it has been co-sponsored by 134 House members and it would clear the way for a project that runs from the Canadian border to the Gulf of Mexico. But the more important problem, the experts said, is that the bill does not affect federal spending -- something the House rule explicitly requires. Grayson, they said, got around this by dropping most of the following clause from his streamlined definition: ""providing, authorizing or recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget authority, credit authority, or other spending authority."" Donald Wolfensberger, a former Republican staff director of the House Rules Committee who currently directs the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, cited the Congressional Budget Office in arguing that H.R. 3 ""comes nowhere near being an earmark as defined by House rules, period."" When CBO -- Congress’ nonpartisan fiscal-analysis arm -- weighed the bill’s fiscal impact, it found that ""implementing H.R. 3 would have no significant impact on the federal budget. Based on information from affected agencies, CBO estimates that the proposed changes to administrative procedures would not significantly affect federal spending for such activities relative to current law. The bill would not affect direct spending or revenues."" Roy T. Meyers, political scientist at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County who has studied budgeting and earmarks, said he was ""astonished to see how (Grayson) selectively and misleadingly edited the definition of earmark, then compounded the fault by drawing a bizarre inference regarding the bill's effective approval of a permit. This bill is about administrative regulation, or more accurately, the lack of it. The earmark definition restricts its application to spending, and lists different types of spending, including grants. Grayson cuts the words on spending and the other types of spending besides grants and replaces these missing words with ellipses, which completely changes the meaning."" Two other experts -- Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, and Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansas political scientist -- agreed with this analysis. ""There has to be a dollar figure associated with the provision, and this bill does not have that,"" Ellis said. Grayson’s office stands by its classification of the bill as an earmark, arguing that the House voted on a measure that amounts to a special favor to one entity, for one project, and that was requested by a Member of Congress, Rep. Lee Terry, R-Neb. Despite Meyers’ deep skepticism of Grayson’s claim that the bill is an earmark under House rules, he said Grayson has a point. ""Earmarks have been criticized, often justifiably, for not being subject to sufficient scrutiny on their policy merits,"" Myers said. ""Unlike most research grants that are subject to demanding peer reviews, or many contracts that must undergo extensive agency review and competitive bidding, earmarks are awarded only after cursory reviews, typically by committee staff. Congress substitutes its judgment on a particular case, cutting agencies and other experts out of the loop."" The similarity here, Meyers said, is that the bill prevents agencies from doing their job -- to assess the impacts of a proposed project. Still, that’s not the same thing as arguing that H.R. 3 actually qualifies as an earmark under House rules. ""Grayson would be smarter to argue that the bill violates the spirit, not the letter, of the earmark moratorium and the philosophy that supposedly backs it,"" Meyers said. We should note that the House -- the only body that can officially determine whether a bill fits the earmark definition under the chamber’s rules -- has not passed judgment on Grayson’s claim. When Grayson raised his argument on the House floor, the lawmaker chairing the proceedings ruled that Grayson’s request was improper, dismissing it before allowing any discussion of the substance of Grayson’s complaint. Grayson’s office added that they have not received ruling determination on the merits of his arguments from the House parliamentarian’s office. This result is not surprising. Grayson wasn’t going into court to argue to an impartial judge; in the House, whichever party happens to be in the majority controls the chamber to a near-dictatorial degree. And to nobody’s surprise, the measure passed by a 241-175 margin when it came to a vote on May 22, 2013. No Republican broke ranks by opposing it, while 19 Democrats sided with the majority in supporting the bill. Because the Democratic-controlled Senate is unlikely to agree, the bill is not expected to become law. Our ruling Grayson said a bill to advance the Keystone XL Pipeline ""is an earmark"" under House rules. Officially, the House -- the only entity that can make this ruling -- has not rendered a judgment on Grayson’s claim. But several experts on earmarks that we checked with were unanimous that Grayson was wrong by the clear language of the rule. The House’s definition of ""earmark"" is based on the notion that the provision in question spends federal money, which the bill in question does not -- a difference that Grayson carefully edited out when he made his argument to Boehner",False,"May 31, 2013"
"""Science has not shown greenhouse gases to be a problem.""","Wayne Smith does not sweat greenhouse gases.

""Science has not shown greenhouse gases to be a problem,"" the Republican Baytown state representative told the Austin American-Statesman for a news article posted online April 17, 2013.

Smith, who seeks legislative approval of a proposal to have the state issue permits for such industrial emissions, also said that nevertheless, ""there’s no need to regulate greenhouse gases."" House members sent his proposal to the Senate that week.

We explored whether science has not shown greenhouse gases--meaning various gaseous compounds (such as carbon dioxide) that absorb infrared radiation, trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to the greenhouse effect--to be a problem.

Smith, who represents a district that is home to petrochemical plants, did not respond to telephone inquiries, but we ran his claim by Paul C. ""Chip"" Knappenberger, assistant director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, which might be philosophically compatible with the Texan.

By phone, Knappenberger said the effects of greenhouse gases on climate change are scientifically proven.

But whether that’s a problem, he said, is ""open-ended. If you define all change as a problem, then you have a problem. How much of a problem it is depends on how fast and how large the climate change is that results.""

Knappenberger also pointed out articles he wrote in February and March 2013 suggesting fresh research indicates the generally predicted pace of warming may be overstated. ""I am not convinced that the pace of global warming is sufficient enough to make greenhouse gas emissions a ‘problem,’"" Knappenberger emailed.

Separately, several experts including the Texas state climatologist, John Nielsen-Gammon, told us the scientific consensus is that increases in greenhouse gases, mostly due to burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil, have been contributing to global warming, though the pace of that warming is uncertain.

Naomi Oreskes, a professor of history at the University of California, San Diego, sent us a chapter of a pending book updating her 2004 look into scientific consensus about climate change. A portion of the chapter says: ""Scientists predicted a long time ago that increasing greenhouse gas emissions could change the climate, and now there is overwhelming evidence that it is changing the climate."" However, ""to say that man-made global warming is underway is not the same as agreeing about what will happen in the future. Much of the continuing debate in the scientific community involves the likely rate of future change. ""

""There are climate scientists who actively do research in the field but disagree with the consensus position,"" the chapter later says, ""but their number is very, very small.""

By phone, Nielsen-Gammon said a helpful indicator of the scientific consensus is the latest assessment of global warming factors, published in 2007 by the International Panel on Climate Change. That body was created in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environmental Programme to evaluate the state of climate science as a basis for informed policy action, primarily on the basis of peer-reviewed and published scientific literature, Oreskes has noted.

The 2007 report says both that evidence of global warming is ""unequivocal"" and that most ""of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations.""

In the United States by itself, Nielsen-Gammon pointed out, the National Research Council, which is among a few independent, nonprofit U.S. institutions that provide science, technology, and health policy advice under a congressional charter, issued an analysis in May 2011. A press release summarizing that work opens: ""Warning that the risk of dangerous climate change impacts is growing with every ton of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere, a"" council ""committee today reiterated the pressing need for substantial action to limit the magnitude of climate change and to prepare to adapt to its impacts.""

Separately, an online search led us to a survey of scientists, published in 2009, that initially asked more than 10,000 earth scientists to participate. Among 3,146 respondents asked if they think ""human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures,"" 82 percent answered affirmatively, with 97 pecent of those respondents with the most climate expertise saying yes.

The article, whose lead author was Peter T. Doran, a professor of earth and environmental sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago, closes: ""It seems that the debate on the authenticity of global warming and the role played by human activity is largely nonexistent among those who understand the nuances and scientific basis of long-term climate processes. The challenge, rather, appears to be how to effectively communicate this fact to policy makers and to a public that continues to mistakenly perceive debate among scientists.""

Similarly, Oreskes said by email, the National Academy of Sciences published the results of a survey of about 900 ""actively publishing"" climate scientists in 2010, finding that 97 percent of the scientists agreed with the ""tenets of anthropogenic climate change,"" meaning human contributions to warming.

Oreskes told us by email: ""The conclusion that humans have contributed to global warming cannot be separated from the role of greenhouse gases  produced by burning fossil fuels. To separate human activities from greenhouse gases is a false dichotomy. Increased greenhouse gases are a direct result of human activities, mainly burning fossil fuels. The scientific conclusion is that ‘most’ of the observed warming of the past 50 years is very likely to be due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, caused by burning fossil fuels. Most of the rest has been caused by deforestation.  Both are human activities, and both are a problem, because they drive adverse impacts like heat waves and droughts.""   

A speculation: Perhaps Smith concedes that greenhouse gases contribute to global warming, but maintains that warming itself is not a problem.

Besides, should his claim be laid aside because any definition of ""problem"" invokes personal judgment?

Scientists see that point, but...

Oreskes said by email: ""Of course, the word ‘problem’ is subjective, but insofar as one can say that there is evidence that bears on the issue, the scientific community has amply supplied that evidence."" By telephone and email, Katharine Hayhoe, director of the Climate Science Center at  Texas Tech University, said she considers greenhouse gases a very expensive problem because western civilization has been built on the premise of a stable climate. Burning fossil fuels, she said, has fed the greenhouse effect.

Our ruling

Smith said science has not shown greenhouse gases to be a problem.

But scientists have agreed for years that such gases contribute to atmospheric changes driving climatic warming, which is characterized as a global threat.

We considered the idea that the legislator’s reference to greenhouse gases as a ""problem"" reflects an uncheckable judgment, a matter of opinion. However, our sense is that his statement purported to reflect scientific consensus--and by that yardstick, it is both incorrect and ridiculous",False Pants on Fire,"May 2, 2013"
"""Narragansett Bay waters are getting warmer -- 4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer in the winter since the 1960s.""","Want evidence of man-made climate change? U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse says you can feel it in the waters of Narragansett Bay, which covers about 120.5 square miles, from Newport to Providence, in his home state of Rhode Island. ""Narragansett Bay waters are getting warmer -- 4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer in the winter since the 1960s,"" he said April 9 during one of his regular climate speeches on the floor of the Senate. He blamed the warmer temperatures for a drop in the flounder catch from more than 2,500 metric tons in the 1980s to about 150 metric tons in 2009. The reason: Warmer temperatures attract winter flounder predators earlier in the season. We can save the winter flounder factoid for another day. We were interested in whether Bay water has, in fact, gotten 4 degrees warmer since the 1960s, especially when water temperatures can fluctuate naturally from year to year. Whitehouse's office directed us to a 2008 article written by researchers at the University of Rhode Island’s Graduate School of Oceanography and published in the journal Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science. It says that the surface water of the Bay from December through February ""has warmed on average by about 2.2 degrees Celsius since 1960."" That would be 4 degrees Fahrenheit. An accompanying chart showing the trend ends at 2006. We wondered whether the increase continued beyond that. Next we contacted Jeremy Collie, a URI oceanographer. ""There's clearly a warming signal,"" he said as he looked at the trend line for data from 1959 through 2010. ""If you look at the winter months and take a regression, you get a warming rate of about 0.5 degrees F. per decade."" That would be about 2.5 degrees F. since 1960. ""So 4 degrees is a little on the high end,"" he  said. He cautioned that there can be a lot of normal variation in the readings from winter to winter. The data, collected off Fox Island, located between North Kingstown and the Jamestown Bridge, can be downloaded from URI's website (search for ""fox island 1959-2010""). We double-checked the trend, using Microsoft Excel's ability to create a chart, and found an increase, of 2.4 degrees for December-February from 1959-2010. (It rose to 2.7 degrees if you didn't include the winter of 1959-60, which might not be considered to be in the 1960s.) We also checked the data for another temperature measuring site: Whale Rock, south of the bridge on the same side of the Bay. Using data from December 1960 through February 2010, we again found an increase of 2.7 degrees F. In both locations, temperatures deeper in the water rose a bit more -- about 3 degrees -- but still not by the amount the senator said. It's unclear why the older study reported a surface temperature 1.5 degrees higher than our newer look at the data. The 2008 article appears to be using the same data we did. The additional winters we looked at had some colder-than-normal temperatures but that doesn't seem to be enough to account for the difference. Our ruling When Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said ""Narragansett Bay waters are getting warmer -- 4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer in the winter since the 1960s,"" he was citing a URI study that offered the observation after authors examined temperatures through 2006. The latest data for December, January and February -- the months used in the URI study -- extending through 2010 reveal that the increase since the '60s is less extreme.

"Says U.S. greenhouse gas ""emissions are at 20-year lows.""","As President Barack Obama brought up his interest in addressing global warming, a Texas congressman said U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases, widely believed to be fueling climate change, are on the decline.   ""DID YOU KNOW?"" Rep. Joe Barton, R-Arlington, wrote on Twitter during Obama’s Feb. 12, 2013, State of the Union address. ""U.S. GHG emissions are at 20-year lows while global emissions are rising.""     Global emissions have been on the upswing. The Environmental Protection Agency says on a web page that global carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels ""increased by over 16 times between 1900 and 2008 and by about 1.5 times between 1990 and 2008."" Separately, the government’s Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center contributed to a December 2012 ""discussion paper"" stating that in 2011, estimated global carbon dioxide emissions due to burning fossil fuels and making cement were up 3 percent from 2010.     We checked on Barton’s claim that domestic greenhouse gas emissions are at a 20-year low.     By email, Barton spokesman Sean Brown pointed out an August 2012 web post by the U.S. Energy Information Administration stating that estimated U.S. carbon dioxide emissions resulting from energy use during the first three months of 2012 ""were the lowest in two decades for any January-March period."" Brown also noted the Environmental Protection Agency saying in an online chart that as of 2010, concentrations of five common air pollutants--carbon monoxide, ozone, lead, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide--had decreased from 30 years earlier.     This information did not speak to all greenhouse gases, as Barton had, but carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.     Perry Lindstrom, an economist with the Energy Information Administration, emailed us a spreadsheet indicating that the nation’s energy-related carbon dioxide emissions were estimated at 1,339 million metric tons in the first quarter of 1992 and at a slightly higher amount, 1,344 million metric tons, for the comparable months of 2012. In the intervening years, first-quarter emissions topped out at 1,580 million metric tons in 2004 and bottomed out at 1,364 million metric tons in 1993, according to the spreadsheet.     Then again, the first quarter of 2012 was unusual, the agency said in its post. ""Normally,"" the agency wrote, carbon dioxide ""emissions during the year are highest in the first quarter because of strong demand for heat produced by fossil fuels."" But such emissions were lower at the start of 2012 thanks to a mild winter, which reduced heating demand and energy use, the agency said, with other factors including a decline in coal-fired electricity generation, due largely to low natural gas prices, and reduced gasoline demand.     Still, the 2012 first-quarter emissions were lower than they had been in the first part of the year in 19 years. However, Lindstrom said by telephone, he would hesitate to reach conclusions solely by comparing emissions in part of a year to emissions in part of another year in contrast to looking, say, decade to decade. At our request, he provided a spreadsheet comparing energy-related carbon dioxide emissions for the 10 months through October 2012 to such emissions over the comparable part of each previous year over two decades. Our thinking was that this would deliver a longer view based on the latest information available when Barton tweeted. And according to this spreadsheet, the estimated emissions from January through October 2012, 4,386 metric tons, were the lowest 10-month total since 1995--17 years earlier--when such emissions totaled 4,385 metric tons.     Going forward, Lindstrom pointed out, his agency projects U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide emissions to remain below 2005 levels through 2040. Jim Butler, director of global monitoring at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Earth System Research Laboratory, said by phone that such levelling out makes sense due to improvements in energy efficiency and shifts to fuel sources with less of a carbon footprint than coal.     Mindful that Barton’s tweet said greenhouse gas emissions were at a 20-year low, we looked next at emissions of methane, nitrous dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride as estimated in the Environmental Protection Agency’s April 2012 inventory of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions--the latest inventory that would have been available when Barton tweeted. (The agency’s 2013 ""draft inventory"" was posted online Feb. 22, 2013.)     The 2012 inventory indicates that total emissions of three gases were higher in 2010 than 1990, while emissions of four others were lower.     In keeping with Barton’s 20-year window, we used the inventory figures to gauge the difference between estimated emissions of each greenhouse gas in 2010 and 1990:     --Carbon dioxide emissions in 2010 were 12 percent greater than in 1990;   --Methane emissions were lower by 0.3 percent; --Nitrous oxide emissions were lower by 3 percent; --Hydrofluorocarbon emissions were higher by more than 200 percent; --Perfluorocarbons were lower by 73 percent; --Sulfur hexafluoride emissions were lower by 57 percent.   Taking all the greenhouse gases into account, according to the inventory, overall emissions were 11 percent higher in 2010 than 1990--and also up 3 percent from 2009, when total emissions dipped considerably during the national recession. Aside from 2009, the previous year with lower greenhouse gas emissions than 2010 was 1997, according to the inventory.     Our ruling     The congressman said domestic greenhouse gas emissions are at a 20-year low.     This statement depends on a comparison of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions—not all greenhouse gases--over three unusually warm winter months of 2012 to such emissions in the same months of 1992. But the latest information available when Barton tweeted indicates that total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions were higher in 2010 than they were 20 years earlier, though the 2010 emissions were lower than they were 13 years earlier",Mostly False,"April 1, 2013"

It’s a high-stakes, high volume, politically charged exercise. Environmentalists have protested -- and been arrested -- in recent days in front of the White House as part of their campaign to pressure President Barack Obama to reject the project.

The other side has been just as active. That includes U.S. Rep. Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican who has long supported the pipeline as a way to make the United States more energy self-sufficient and boost the economy -- even in Oregon.

Here’s what he tweeted Jan. 29, 2013: ""Did you know that the#KeystoneXL project is expected to create 20,000 American jobs, including more than 800 in Oregon?""

That’s an attention-grabbing statement for two reasons. The first is the overall number of jobs at a time when the U.S. economy continues to struggle. The second concerns both numbers and geography. The pipeline as proposed would enter the U.S. in Montana and angle toward the Gulf on an eastward track through South Dakota and Nebraska. From there it continues to the Gulf.

Even if the route changes, the pipeline will be 1,000 miles (or more) from Oregon. So it’s fair to ask, how will a state so far removed from the project claim 800 jobs? Here’s a second, more basic question: Is the 20,000 ""American jobs"" cited by Walden and many other supporters of the project real?

Let’s take a look.

Sure enough, TransCanada, the company proposing the pipeline has cited the potential for 20,000 jobs. ""The $7 billion oil pipeline is the largest infrastructure project on the books in the U.S. right now,"" the company said in a 2012 news release. ""It would create 20,000 jobs: 13,000 in construction, 7,000 in manufacturing.""

There have been numerous analyses and copious filings by the company itself in pursuit of the permit.

And yet, the conclusion that 20,000 jobs would be created is more than a bit slippery.

A 2011 study by Cornell University is absolute: ""The company’s claim that KXL will create 20,000 direct construction and manufacturing jobs in the U.S is not substantiated,"" it states.

One of the more troublesome devices is this: The total is a reflection of something called ""job years."" Why is that important?  A ""job year"" is a measure of one job performed for one year. That means if a single worker stays on the job for the two years the pipeline construction is expected to last, that single worker counts as two jobs.

The measure might be accepted -- and used -- by economists but it’s not what the average person thinks when hearing the word ""job."" TransCanada says the 20,000 jobs include 13,000 direct jobs, mostly construction and 7,000 indirect jobs. If the project takes two years, it means 6,500 actual direct jobs (plus or minus), which is the number the State Department uses.

Calculated that way, the actual number of people employed by the pipeline moves closer to 10,000, or some 6,500 workers in construction and 3,500 in manufacturing. Not 20,000.
   
Here’s another important point: These construction jobs are not permanent and, for the most part, aren’t necessarily local. The positions will disappear when the pipeline is complete. The State Department estimates that only 10 to 15 percent of these jobs can be filled with workers from communities in the pipeline’s path.

As for the broader (and always murky) world of indirect jobs, the study  -- by Lara Skinner and Sean Sweeney at Cornell’s Global Labor Institute -- raises questions about an analysis by the Perryman Group, which was hired by TransCanada to look at economic impacts.

""The Perryman study is based on expenditure and sourcing data provided by TransCanada,
and none of that information has been disclosed or subject to independent review,"" the Cornell study says.

By their calculations, Perryman uses a multiplier of 18 job-years for every $1 million spent on the project. Skinner and Sweeney write that a more acceptable multiplier is 11 job-years for every $1 million spent.

""So a reasonable estimate of the total incremental U.S. jobs from KXL construction is about one-third of the figure estimated in the Perryman study and used by industry to advocate for the construction of KXL,"" the Cornell study concludes.

Let’s move on to the second part of Walden’s claim, that the pipeline would bring ""800 jobs"" to Oregon.

Unlike a lot of states far removed from the actual pipeline route, there is an official thread to Oregon.

In a January 2012 news release promoting the pipeline’s economic value, TransCanada says this: ""Construction of Keystone XL is expected to create 7000 manufacturing jobs.  Key support companies include: Welspun (pipe from Arkansas), Cameron (valves from Louisiana), Siemens (pumps, motors and related control equipment manufactured in Oregon, Ohio and Indiana) and dozens of other companies manufacturing everything from nuts and bolts to complex electrical control equipment.""

That’s as specific as it gets, however. When asked for source material to back this claim of 800 jobs, Walden’s office referred to a Chamber of Commerce study. Sure enough, the publication says there will be 838 jobsattributable to the pipelinein Oregon by 2020. (Once again, the use of ""jobs"" is not what an average person expects.)

Chamber of Commerce spokeswoman Blair Latoff Holmes said the number was taken from a study commissioned by the pro-pipeline American Petroleum Institute, written by the Canadian Energy Research Institute and released in June 2011.


All of these studies are vulnerable to criticism because the formulas are by necessity often more art than science and the methodology used is not clearly expressed. That’s why the conclusions should be consumed with caution.

But tone matters too. In his statement, Walden seems absolute even while there is no clarification that the 20,000 figure refers to ""job years,"" which is much different than the way ""job"" is commonly understood.

Walden has a somewhat stronger case on the Oregon job claim, mostly because TransCanada mentions Oregon by name as one state that would produce equipment needed for the project. As for the number 800, however, it is at best a guess.

That’s a pipeline full of uncertainty",Mostly False,"February 27, 2013"
Says Texas ranks first among the states in the amount of carbon dioxide emitted and toxic chemicals released into water.,"Reacting to Gov. Rick Perry’s pitch and woo of Californians, a Sacramento Bee editorial played off of a radio ad in which Perry urged businesses there to check out Texas.

The Feb. 6, 2013, editorial listed various ways Texas isn’t so great. We’ve since piled up related fact checks, here.

For this article, we’re reviewing this Texas reference in the editorial: ""Come check out a state that ranks... first in the amount of carbon dioxide emitted and first in the amount of toxic chemicals released into water.""

No. 1 polluter, times two?

Stuart Leavenworth, who oversees the Bee editorial page, did not offer backup for the reference to toxic chemical releases. But he pointed us to a Texas news account about carbon dioxide emissions.

For our look, we’ll consider CO2, then toxic chemicals put into water, looking both at raw amounts and the totals adjusted for state populations and economic output.

Carbon dioxide emissions The Jan. 12, 2012, Houston Chronicle news article says that according to federal data released that day, Texas releases far more greenhouse gases into the air than any other state. The story continues: ""Texas' coal-fired power plants and oil refineries generated 294 million tons of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases in 2010, more than the next two states – Pennsylvania and Florida – combined, the data show.""

The story says the Environmental Protection Agency released the data from the largest industrial sources across the country for the first time as part of a broader effort to reduce emissions linked to global warming. It says the agency ""collected data from more than 6,700 industrial facilities that release at least 25,000 tons of greenhouse gases into the air a year. The threshold is comparable to the emissions from burning 131 railcars of coal, the EPA said.""

To our inquiries, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the Sierra Club in Texas each guided us to even more recent EPA data on industrial emissions of greenhouse gases, the primary driver of climate change, the federal agency says.

And on the agency’s website, it’s possible to check on each state’s industrial emissions of eight gases, among them carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons.

According to the posted information, Texas industrial facilities in 2011 emitted 391 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, mainly produced from the burning of fossil fuels. The database indicates that industrial CO2 emissions in other populous states were lower: California (95 million metric tons); New York (44); Florida (123); Illinois (41); Pennsylvania (141): Ohio (142); Michigan (89); Georgia (82); North Carolina (66); and New Jersey (23). Louisiana, on the Gulf Coast like Texas, had 132 million metric tons of CO2 emissions, according to the agency.

It’s no surprise, perhaps, that Texas plants make the state No. 1 in industrial carbon dioxide emissions. Neil Carman, who directs the Clean Air program for the Sierra Club’s Lone Star chapter, told us by email: ""Realize that Texas has more large oil refineries, major chemical and petrochemical plants, hundreds of natural gas processing plants, Portland cement kilns, carbon black plants, etc. than any other state because of the strength of the oil & gas industry and the large geographical size and population base as well.""

Carman’s comment underscored a hitch in the federal information. The data does not reflect total gases emitted in each state--just those attributed to industrial facilities.

Yet Al Armendariz of the Sierra Club guided us to a spreadsheet prepared by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, based on its analysis of emissions from the consumption of fossil fuels, estimating that in 2010, Texas had 653 million metric tons of CO2 emissions. California placed second, at 370 million metric tons, and Pennsylvania was third, at 257 million metric tons.

So, Texas has been No. 1 in total CO2 emissions. However, we calculated, Texas would have tied for 13th among the states if each state’s emissions were adjusted for its population that year, as gauged by the U.S. Census Bureau. Less populous states led after this adjustment, topped by Wyoming (108 metric tons per capita); North Dakota (76); Alaska (56); Louisiana (50); Montana (36); Kentucky (35); Indiana (34); Iowa (30); Alabama and New Mexico (28); Nebraska and Oklahoma (27). Kansas and Texas each had 26 metric tons of CO2 emissions per resident. California emissions were 10 metric tons per resident.

Toxic chemical releases Wondering how Texas ranks in toxic chemicals released into water, we queried Luke Metzger, who heads Environment Texas, which describes itself as a statewide citizen-funded advocate for clean air, clean water and open spaces.

Metzger pointed out that the EPA maintains a Toxic Release Inventory, tabulating reported releases into waterways of 231 toxic chemicals or classes of toxic pollutants. Environment Texas drew on the inventory for an April 2012 report stating that Texas ranked fourth nationally in 2010 with 14.3 million pounds of toxic discharges.

Top Ten States by Toxic Industrial Releases Into Waterways, 2010 (Millions of Pounds) 

Source: Environment Texas, April 2012 report.

According to the report, Indiana had the most toxic releases, more than 27 million pounds, followed by Virginia (18 million pounds) and Nebraska (14.7 million pounds). Nationally, 226 million pounds were released in 2010, the report says. It cautions, too, that the totals solely reflect industrial releases, not accounting for other sources including wastewater treatment plants and agriculture-related facilities. Still, the report says, the federal inventory is the ""best and most complete set of data available.""

Adjusting these figures for each state’s 2010 population changes the rank order, putting Texas at No. 10, with toxic releases of 0.6 pounds per resident--and that is also without checking per-capita tallies for 40 remaining states. On a per-person basis, Nebraska led the nine other states, at 8 pounds per resident, followed by Indiana (4) and Virginia (2). Every other of the 10 states had a ratio of less than two pounds per resident.

By telephone, a consultant to Environment Texas, Tony Dutzik of the Boston-based Frontier Group, said another way to gauge CO2 emissions and toxic releases into water by state is to compare totals compared to each state’s Gross Domestic Product, which indicates its economic activity. We tried that for the 2010 toxic releases by using state GDPs for 2010, as posted by the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. By this filter, Nebraska had the most toxic releases per dollar of GDP, Texas the 10th-highest--again, only among the 10 states identified as having the most overall industrial releases that year.

We also applied the GDP filter to the 10 states, including Texas, that had the greatest industrial CO2 emissions in 2010. By this metric, Texas was tied with Kansas for 12th; Wyoming ranked first.

By email, Metzger sent a spreadsheet, which he said Dutzik had built from more recent data posted by the EPA, indicating that Texas ranked third overall among the states in industrial toxic releases into water in 2011, trailing Indiana and Virginia, but running ahead of Georgia.

Our ruling

The editorial said Texas ranks first nationally in the amount of carbon dioxide emitted and toxic chemicals released into water.

We can see a basis for the first part of the claim, though not the second. Texas ranks No. 1 in CO2 emissions, by a wide margin. But it trailed about a dozen states in 2010 after each state's emissions were adjusted for the state's population or economic output.

In 2011, Texas ranked third in total industrial releases of toxic chemicals into water; it was fourth nationally the previous year--and adjusting for each state’s population or economic output leaves Texas in 10th place among those states with the most industrial toxic releases that year",Half True,"February 13, 2013"
"Tide gauges measuring sea level in Rhode Island since 1930 have risen ""maybe about 10 inches since that time.""","Sandy, the so-called ""superstorm"" that struck the East Coast in October 2012, did more than produce massive damage. It also got a lot of people talking about climate change.

Climate scientists say Earth is warming, and most say it’s due to polluting gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. Stronger storms are one predicted result.

And scientists say the storms are going to be even more damaging because the excess heat will cause sea level to rise, both by a melting of the polar ice caps and because water expands as it warms.

When Janet Freedman, a coastal geologist with Rhode Island's Coastal Resources Management Council, talked about the risk of coastal flooding during an appearance on WJAR-TV’s ""10 News Conference,"" she said the local rise in sea level is pretty clear.

The levels ""have been rising,"" she said. ""In Rhode Island we have two long-term tide gauges that have been measuring the sea level since 1930 and we've seen that they've risen maybe about 10 inches since that time.

""But we anticipate that with global warming, that's going to be faster, it's going to accelerate. Most models show we'll see a foot of sea-level rise as early as 2030 but definitely 2050 we expect to see sea levels that are higher than they are now.""

PolitiFact doesn't rate predictions, so we focused on whether sea level has really risen about 10 inches over the past eight decades -- an average of 1.25 inches every 10 years.

We contacted Freedman, who sent us to several sources.

The Sea Levels Online website, part of the Tides & Currents portion of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration website, has data from tide gauges around the world. Selecting ""Rhode Island"" sends you to data from gauges in Newport and Providence.

The Newport data show that from 1930 to 2006, the mean water level has risen by 2.58 millimeters -- about a tenth of an inch -- per year. Data that take the readings through 2011 show that the overall rate over that 81-year-period has actually increased to 2.70 mm/year. We calculate the rise from 1930 to 2012 to be 211.6 mm or 8.7 inches. That's not 10 inches, but Freedman said ""maybe about.""

(It's also important to note that there is a margin of error in these numbers because they are averages based on readings that fluctuate due to waves, tides, winds and other factors. The average may be 8.7 inches but the real number could be as high as 9.3 inches or as low as 8.1 inches. The odds of it being outside this ""confidence interval"" during that period are 1 in 20.)

The Providence tide gauge hasn't produced as much data. Records begin around 1940 and there is a large gap in the 1950s. But the overall rate as of 2011 is also lower: 2.19 mm per year. If we extrapolate that back to 1930 and forward to 2012, that's 179.6 mm or 7.1 inches since 1930. Although the margin of error could take it as high as 8.0 inches, somewhat further from 10 inches than the Newport data.

We also contacted Jon Boothroyd of the University of Rhode Island, who is designated by the U.S. Geological Survey as the state geologist. He crunches the tide gauge numbers a bit differently, taking the monthly data and averaging it for a year. He has also included more recent data. His estimate: 269 mm per 100 years. Over 82 years, that would be 220.6 mm, which is 8.7 inches as well. (The range here is 9.4 inches to 7.9 inches.)

However, Boothroyd said that if you look at the actual year-to-year annual readings from Newport between 1930 and 2011, the increase has been about 270 mm, or 10.6 inches.

Boothroyd said he doesn't use the Providence tide gauge data because he had doubts about it -- the readings are too far off from the Newport readings.

Sea level can fluctuate if land rises or falls, for example. But between Providence and Newport, ""the bedrock and the conditions are so close to one another, it doesn't make sense why that rate of sea level rise is lower than it is in Newport,"" he said. The gauge in Providence ""is on a pier, and I don't think the pilings on that pier are sunk to bedrock. So the pier could be slowly subsiding, but the gauge shows exactly the opposite. So I don't use that number because I can't understand it. It's a really sticky wicket.""

These days, satellites offer the best measurement of sea levels, and they do it every 10 days across most of the world, said Steven Nerem a climate researcher at the University of Colorado at Boulder.

""The satellites are all referenced to Earth's geocenter, so our data are not affected by the land motion,"" he said.

In addition, coastal temperatures, winds, the saltiness of the water, atmospheric pressure and ocean currents all have an effect on the height of the water at individual locations, which is why researchers have to use a global average and look at long-term trends.

For example, when the Pacific warms during an El Nino, ""you have more precipitation over the oceans than in the continents, and you get a short-term increase in sea level,"" said Nerem ""When you have La Nina (Pacific cooling), you get more precipitation over the continents and the water gets stored there for some period of time, so you have a temporary lowering of sea level.""

According to the satellite data, available at the website sealevel.colorado.edu, the global sea level has risen by 3.2 mm per year since 1993. If you assume that the rise has been steady since 1930, that would translate to an average worldwide increase of 10.3 inches. (Range: 9.0 inches up to 11.6 inches.)

Is the pace of sea level rise increasing?

""That's the $10 million question,"" said Nerem. ""Over the last 100 years there is a suggestion that  there is a small acceleration. If you just look at the satellite data, we don't see an acceleration. So over the last 20 years, it may just be too small, given all this variability, to detect.""

Boothroyd, however, said, ""There is some indication that worldwide sea level has risen at a faster rate since 1990. Our graph suggests that is true for Newport"" citing the uptick in 2010 and 2011.

Freedman said Boothroyd's numbers, which show a slightly higher annual increase, may be pointing to sea levels rising faster today. ""This trend seems to suggest that we are seeing acceleration in sea level rise over the last 20 years, but because there is so much variability in sea levels we really need forty years of sea levels to say that with scientific certainty.""

Our ruling

Janet Freedman, a geologist with Rhode Island's Coastal Resources Management Council, said, ""In Rhode Island we have two long-term tide gauges that have been measuring the sea level since 1930 and we've seen that they've risen maybe about 10 inches since that time.""

Her ""maybe about"" phrase gives her some wiggle room.

The long-term trend in Newport doesn't quite measure up to 10 inches. It's 8.7 inches. But the actual annual measurements at the beginning and end of that time period meet the truth test, mostly because of a steep -- and not explained -- increase over the last few years.

The Providence tide gauge data, on the other hand, show a much smaller trend over that time period -- it would be just over 7 inches.

Freedman's overarching point that sea levels have been rising is certainly true, and that's borne out by satellite data.

"""Hurricane Sandy, the most destructive Atlantic storm ever.""","Hurricane Sandy is probably the worst storm to hit New Jersey after it killed 40 people, remade parts of the Shore’s coastline and caused damages in the tens of billions of dollars.

But just how bad was it compared with other hurricanes?

""New Jersey can and must do more to slow global warming, especially after 2012's extreme weather and Hurricane Sandy, the most destructive Atlantic storm ever,"" Environment New Jersey said recently on its website.

The most destructive Atlantic storm? Ever? Considering the magnitude of some other hurricanes in history, PolitiFact New Jersey decided to investigate. Doug O’Malley, interim director for Environment New Jersey, said 'destructive' refers to the storm's financial damages. Data shows that while Sandy may be the worst storm to ever batter New Jersey and the tristate region, it’s not the most destructive Atlantic storm in history.

Let’s start with some background.

Sandy slammed New Jersey on Oct. 29, leveling houses along the Shore and inland, and leaving millions without power for extended periods. The storm also unleashed a similar fury on New York and Connecticut.
  
We checked Atlantic storms in the National Hurricane Center’s data archives, which tracks storm costs through 2010. Hurricane Irene, which hit New Jersey in 2011, is not included.

Leading the list is 2005’s Hurricane Katrina, at $108 billion. Even though Katrina was largely a Gulf Coast storm, doing the most damage in Louisiana and Mississippi, it formed in the Atlantic and made landfall near Florida’s Miami-Dade/Broward county line. It then moved across south Florida into the eastern Gulf of Mexico, according to Hurricane Center data.

""Katrina is still a clear runaway number one"" in terms of damages, said Dennis Eltgen, a spokesman at the Miami-based Hurricane Center.

Second on the list is 1992’s Hurricane Andrew, at $26.5 billion in damages. Andrew devastated parts of south Florida, continued into the Gulf of Mexico and turned north, hitting Louisiana.

Those rankings change when damages are adjusted for 2010 dollars.

In that case, the Great Miami Hurricane of 1926 that hit southeast Florida and Alabama ranks first, at $164.8 billion; Katrina second, at $113 billion; and Andrew fifth, at $58.5 billion.

Sandy, however, is different than many hurricanes that often swing through the Gulf of Mexico.

""I don’t think we were trying to claim that Sandy was more destructive than Katrina,"" O’Malley said. ""We were trying to say Sandy was the worst hurricane to fully hit the Eastern Seaboard. That being said, Katrina did obviously really hit New Orleans but clearly, it tailed over Florida. We were counting Katrina as only hitting the Gulf Coast. We trust the National Hurricane Center. If they say it’s both, we agree with that.""

The governors of New Jersey, New York and Connecticut have estimated Sandy’s damages at $82 billion. President Obama has requested $60 billion in federal aid for the three states. The Senate approved the request and the House passed a $9 billion aid package Friday, and additional aid is expected to pass on Jan. 15.

In making the aid request for the White House, Jeffrey D. Zients, deputy director for Management for the Office of Management and Budget, described Sandy’s place in hurricane history in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio).

""All told, although estimates of the total damage of Hurricane Sandy remain in flux, current projections are that Sandy is on track to be the second or third most costly natural disaster in U.S, history, behind Hurricane Katrina (2005) and close to Hurricane Andrew (1992),"" Zients wrote.

Our ruling

Environment New Jersey claimed that October’s Hurricane Sandy is ""the most destructive Atlantic storm, ever.""

Sandy may be the most destructive storm to hit a part of the Eastern Seaboard but in terms of most destructive Atlantic storms, that title goes to Katrina, which formed in the Atlantic and whose damages topped $100 billion, according to Hurricane Center data. Sandy, however, is very high on the list, with damages totaling at least  $82 billion.

"Says that Sherrod Brown is an ""Obama rubber stamp"" for ""supporting the job-killing cap and trade plan.""","U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown took considerable heat for his position on cap-and-trade legislation.

He voted against it in the Senate, which disappointed and even outraged some environmentalists. It was among the biggest issues on which Brown, Ohio's Democratic incumbent, split with President Barack Obama.

That was why PolitiFact Ohio was surprised to hear a radio ad for Brown's Republican challenger, Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel.

The ad blasts Brown for ""supporting the job-killing cap-and-trade plan"" and labels him an  ""Obama rubber stamp.""

We asked the Mandel campaign how that claim was supported, and we reviewed the background.

Cap and trade legislation seeks to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and other greenhouse gas sources by setting caps on the amount of pollutants a plant can spew into the air. Companies that come in below their cap are then allowed to sell their emission credits to other companies that need them. Supporters say the approach provides economic incentives to reduce pollution and innovate. Critics deride it as an energy tax and say it increases costs for everyone.

The approach was originally employed to curb the pollutants that cause acid rain in the early 1990s. President George H.W. Bush championed it, with the support of both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. In 2008, it was one of the few areas of common ground between Obama and his opponent, Sen. John McCain. Both acknowledged climate change and favored carbon caps.

In June 2008, Brown joined Republicans in voting to block a bill which would have imposed a cap-and-trade system of credits for carbon dioxide emissions.

He said he would have liked to support the bill, but he said the measure would place too high a cost on Ohio industry and threatened jobs.

In spring 2009, after Obama had taken office, Brown proposed legislation to provide incentives for manufacturers to adopt green technologies, but said it ""doesn't cause me at all to change any position from last year"" opposing a cap-and-trade system.

He voted shortly afterward to keep the fast-track budget reconciliation process open on an emissions bill, so that it would not face a filibuster, but said he still had significant concerns about the legislation.

""I'm an environmentalist,"" he said. ""I want cap and trade. I just want to make sure that the ratepayers in my state don't get socked hard. And that the manufacturing doesn't get crippled.""
Mandel's campaign cited that quote as a source for its assertion that ""Brown was open to supporting a cap-and-trade proposal.""

But being open to support falls short of endorsement.
Before cap-and-trade legislation stalled and then died in the Senate, the New York Times reported in October 2009 that ""Brown has not been shy about embracing the cap-and-trade policy (but) he also has not endorsed the bill.""

Brown ""has bluntly stated that unless the (carbon emissions bill's) authors agree to a variety of manufacturing and trade provisions, there is little possibility that the legislation will get anywhere near enough support to clear the Senate,"" the article said.

""Clean energy legislation is not just about the environment, it's about creating jobs and revitalizing our nation's manufacturing basis,"" Brown said. ""For a clean energy bill to be successful, it must also be a jobs bill that partners with the business community.""

In early 2011, with no legislation on the table, The Plain Dealer reported that Brown and the coal industry ""both are trying in their own ways to stop President Barack Obama's administration from imposing rules this year on new or upgraded power plants and large factories that use coal because, both say, the rules would hurt Ohio manufacturers and consumers.""

What's the capper on the ad's claim?

The Mandel ad labeled Brown ""an Obama rubberstamp"" for ""supporting the job-killing cap and trade plan.""

We’ll leave the phrase ""job-killing"" to those who debate policy. As a statement of opinion, PolitiFact Ohio won’t rate it.

Regardless, the statement is not accurate. Rather, it invokes the fear of a proposed system for limiting emissions that Congress could never agree on and to this day does not exist.

Brown has expressed support for some form of emissions controls and has said that under the right conditions, he would support cap-and-trade legislation. But it’s also clear that he had reservations about the legislation that has been before the Senate.

When the 2009 bill was pending, Brown never endorsed it. He ""bluntly stated that unless the (carbon emissions bill's) authors agree to a variety of manufacturing and trade provisions, there is little possibility that the legislation will get anywhere near enough support to clear the Senate,"" according to The New York Times. That bill stalled in the Senate and died without a final vote.

In 2008, prior to Obama becoming president, Brown joined Republicans and voted to block a bill that would have created a cap-and-trade system of credits for carbon dioxide emissions.

"Says that in the U.S. House of Representatives ""we’ve had bipartisan support for the repeal of Obamacare … for getting rid of cap and trade … for building the Keystone Pipeline.""","On the eve of what should have been the first day of the Republican National Convention in Tampa – delayed a day by Hurricane Isaac – U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., went on CBS’ ""Face the Nation"" to describe the accomplishments of the much-maligned and unpopular 112th Congress. The Republican Party has had control of the House of Representatives since January 2010 and GOP members have passed a lot of bills. Not many have become law because the U.S. Senate hasn’t taken them up. In some instances, Republican-backed legislation has won the tepid support of a handful of Democrats, and sometimes the full-throated endorsement of large numbers. Either way, that would constitute ""bipartisan support."" Blackburn’s full statement went like this: ""In the House, we've had bipartisan support for the repeal of Obamacare, bipartisan support for moving forward with the budget. We have had bipartisan support for getting rid of cap and trade and stopping that. We've had bipartisan support for building the Keystone Pipeline."" We asked Blackburn’s communications director, Mike Reynard, for the supporting evidence that there was, in fact, bipartisan support, reflected in floor votes, for repeal of the Affordable Care Act (so-called ""Obamacare""), for ""getting rid of cap and trade,"" and for building the Keystone XL Pipeline from Canada to Texas. The House in fact voted to repeal Obamacare on July 11, for the second time. House Republicans have voted to repeal specific parts of the law 30 times. In the July vote, five Democrats — including Mike Ross of Arkansas, who’s not seeking re-election — joined the Republican majority. On cap and trade (an idea that originated with Republicans), back in June of 2009, when the Democrats controlled the House, the American Clean Energy and Security Act passed by a vote of 219-212, with 44 Democrats voting against it. The Senate failed to act, and nothing happened. The House has voted four times in favor of the Keystone XL Pipeline, most recently in April when 69 Democrats joined their Republican colleagues passing a federal highway bill that contained Sections 202-204 related to the pipeline project. By the time House and Senate conferees rewrote the measure, the pipeline language was removed. It then passed both houses and was signed by the president. So, technically, there was bipartisan support for building the pipeline in the House, but nothing happened. Our ruling It’s not unusual for a small number of members of Congress to defy their party’s leadership and vote the way they think is best. Blackburn’s larger point was that, even with bipartisanship on some significant measures, the bills passed in the House aren’t being signed into law because they aren’t being taken up by the Senate, where the various 60-vote requirements for a bill to proceed make passage much more difficult.

Claims Ohio Gov. John Kasich says climate change is a problem.,"Republican devotees who have traveled to Tampa, Fla. for their party’s national convention expect a week filled with activities aimed at unifying the GOP around the central policy and agenda messages as they nominate former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney for president.

But as thousands of out-of-towners arrived and made their trek to the Tampa Bay Times Forum, the arena hosting the convention, they have been greeted by some well-placed advertisements featuring some prominent conservative leaders -- including Ohio Gov. John Kasich -- that are not quite in lock-step with the message Republicans have long touted.

Kasich is prominently featured on a billboard outside the arena and on one at the most central interstate highway crossing in the city, as well as, on some placards adorning 40 city taxi cabs proclaiming his belief that global warming is real.

""I am a believer – my goodness I am a Republican – I happen to believe there is a problem with climate change,"" reads a quote attributed to Kasich that appears next to a picture of the smiling Ohio governor.

But wait, Kasich is still as staunch a conservative as ever, isn’t he? PolitiFact Ohio decided to check if the ad accurately reflects the governor’s position.

The billboard was sponsored by the Florida Wildlife Federation, a private membership group with about 60,000 members who are hunters, fishermen and outdoorsmen with a keen interest in environmental issues. It told PolitiFact Ohio it partnered with the Evangelical Environmental Network, a Washington lobbying group, to place the advertisements.

The Federation’s policy consultant, Jay Liles, said his group is desperate to get politicians to view climate change as a life-changing issue and not a partisan issue. They have skin in this game. And there it is true that some Republicans have staked out a position doubting that climate change is really a factor.

In addition to Kasich, the federation also has sponsored similar ads with similar messages from similarly conservative leaders, such as, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former President George W. Bush.

We checked with Kasich’s staff to see whether the quote was accurate. Rob Nichols, the governor’s spokesman, confirmed that it was taken from a speech Kasich made in May 2012 at a small energy conference in Columbus, Ohio, that was sponsored by The Hill, a Capitol Hill media organization.

""What they have on the billboard is accurate,"" Nichols said, adding that Kasich has uttered similar comments four or five times during various private speeches, some of which were before Republican gatherings.
 
But for context, Nichols said there is a little more to Kasich thoughts on global warming.
 
""He has said this several times but what is usually omitted is what is on the back-end of what he has said,"" Nichols said. ""Each time he says it he has added, ‘How big is this? I don’t know. Should we overreact to this? No.’""
 
In fact, The Hill published an article on May 2, 2012, about Kasich’s speech at the energy conference. The quote on the billboard came from that story, according to the Evangelical Environmental Network.
 
The full quote is: ""I am a believer – my goodness I am a Republican – I happen to believe there is a problem with climate change. I don’t want to overreact to it, I can’t measure it all, but I respect the creation that the Lord has given us and I want to make sure we protect it.""
 
Liles said the Federation was approached by the evangelical group and agreed to sponsor the Tampa advertisements to convince Republicans to stop viewing global warming through political lenses.
 
""We believe at the core that people don’t treat our environment as a right or left issue, it is an issue that affects all of us. It is an issue that affects our pocketbooks,"" Liles said.
 
""Whether it is addressed more through market driven means or through proposed regulatory means,"" he said, ""we believe somewhere in the middle is a road forward and they need to stop making this a partisan issue.""
 
Alexei Laushkin, of the Evangelical Environmental Network, which paid for the advertisements said his group intentionally sought out key conservative leaders to push this agenda.
 
""We in the evangelical community are tired of the politics of the issue and wanted to highlight conservatives who agree with us on this issue,"" Laushkin.
 
For the most part, Republicans have doused talk of global warming saying Democrats are pushing it to enforce more government regulations on the energy industry.
 
The Hill article notes that the Environmental Protection Agency has already begun to try to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and proposed carbon dioxide standards for new power plants to help mitigate the suspected effects of global warming. And that many scientists have long concluded climate change is real. But some Republicans have challenged the proposed EPA standards and questioned scientists conclusions.
 
""We’re hoping at the end of the day it will be a bi-partisan issue, one party can’t solve the issue so we want to highlight conservative leadership on this,"" said Laushkin.
 
Laushkin said he suspects that many Republican delegates who see the signs at the convention will be surprised.

But as far as the quote from Kasich, his own staff confirms its accuracy. As long as Kasich’s comments aren’t used as a scare tactic to get others to believe in climate change then the governor is OK with how he is being portrayed, Nichols said.

And that’s how the billboards convey the message. No scare tactics. Just Kasich saying he agrees climate change is a problem",True,"August 29, 2012"
"Tim Kaine supported ""higher energy costs for families.""","When it comes to economic policies, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says Tim Kaine, the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, is on the wrong track.

A television ad by the Chamber puts the viewer on the front of a train, roaring past billboards proclaiming Kaine’s shortcomings. Among its claims: that Kaine, as governor, supported ""higher energy costs for families.""

As proof, the chamber sent us Kaine’s testimony before a U.S. Senate hearing on climate change and the Chesapeake Bay in 2007. Kaine warned that rising temperatures and sea levels would damage the bay and the Hampton Roads region, and he urged the Senate to take action.

""I support legislation that includes a cap-and-trade program for emissions of all greenhouse gases, imposes economy-wide controls rather than singling out a particular sector, and accounts for state efforts to standardize methodologies to record and measure greenhouse gas emissions through the Climate Registry,"" he said.

Soon after his testimony, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, at the time a Democrat from Connecticut, and Sen. John Warner, R-Va., introduced a bill to implement a cap-and-trade system. Previous cap-and-trade bills were introduced in 2003 and 2005. Kaine did not say that he specifically supported a particular bill.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who introduced the legislation in 2003, said when the 2007 bill was put in the hopper, ""The enormous economic costs of damage caused by air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions to the environment and human health are not factored into the price of power produced by fossil-fueled technologies. Yet, it’s a cost that we all bear, too often in terms of ill-health and diminished quality of life.""

Under cap and trade, the government would limit the allowable emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses. Companies that emit carbon dioxide, such as electric utilities, would either have to reduce emissions by using cleaner technology, or obtain credits from the government - either given or sold through an auction - to exceed limits.

The government could use the revenues in any number of ways, including paying for general expenses, developing new energy-efficiency programs and giving rebates to ratepayers. In the 2007 bill, the national cap on carbon dioxide declined gradually from 5,775 million metric tons in 2012 to 1,732 million metric tons in 2050.

The cost to consumers was analyzed by several government and non-government entities.

The Energy Information Administration concluded that the 2007 legislation would cause gas prices to go up by 22 to 49 cents a gallon in 2020. And that would increase to 41 to 101 cents per gallon higher in 2030.

Meanwhile, depending on the development of technology to capture and store carbon emissions, the average annual cost of household energy bills would increase by between $30 to $325 in 2020, and between $76 to $723 in 2030. Although the EIA does not make estimates beyond 2030, it says the costs would continue to escalate.

The Environmental Protection Agency ran its own numbers. It said mandates to manufacture cleaner fuels would cause gas prices to rise by 53 cents a gallon in 2030 and by $1.40 a gallon in 2050. The EPA also projected that electricity prices would increase 44 percent in 2030 and 26 percent in 2050.

Kaine spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine said  that equating support for cap-and-trade legislation with support for ""higher energy prices for families"" is ""ludicrous."" She said Kaine supports cap and trade as part of a ""package of larger reforms"" that would ""reduce our dependence on carbon-heavy energy sources and encourage the development of alternative energy and conservation.""

She noted that some cap-and-trade proposals would have funneled proceeds from auctions back to consumers in rebates. Under a 2009 bill backed by President Barack Obama, the CBO said those in the lowest 20 percent of earners would save about $40 in 2020, a statistic Hoffine cited. But the CBO also said other households would pay more for electricity, averaging $175 more and up to about $340 more, because they would receive smaller rebates and use more electricity than low-income families.

Hoffine also pointed to a study about the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a 10-state compact for a cap and trade system. The system was put into place in 2009 and was evaluated after three years. The Analysis Group found that consumers saved a net of $1.1 billion compared to what the grid systems would have been without the cap-and-trade system, primarily because the states put auction proceeds toward energy efficiency programs. But ratepayers actually spent about 0.7 percent more for electricity up front.

""In general, it is true that controlling carbon emissions or other pollution from energy will raise the cost of energy relative to not controlling that pollution,"" Adele Morris, fellow and policy director in climate and energy economics at The Brookings Institution, said in an email. But ""the cap and trade approach is a substitute for other, more costly, ways to regulate greenhouse gases.  Right now, because cap-and-trade didn't pass, the EPA is pursuing regulation of those emissions under its existing Clean Air Act authority, which means command and control approaches to regulation.""

The Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, the successor to the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, has  issued fact sheets on several proposals for cap-and-trade legislation and programs.

""Others have claimed that the bill will have no cost impact, but this ignores the very real economic costs of shifting to a clean energy economy,"" the center said of the 2009 bill.

The Lieberman-Warner bill in 2007 proposed to auction some of the credits to pay for renewable technologies, workforce training and low-income energy assistance, while giving the rest to states and other recipients.

The legislation was replaced by a companion bill in 2008, which died in the Senate that year.

Our ruling

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says in a TV ad that Kaine supported ""higher energy costs for families.""

It’s clear, as the Chamber notes in small print, that Kaine backs the concept of cap-and-trade legislation, but there’s no record of his support for a specific bill or proposal. Analyses of two measures that have been before in Congress in recent years concluded that cap-and-trade carries a cost for most consumers.

At least one cap-and-trade program in place has resulted in an average lower cost for consumers through energy efficiency and rebates. And cap-and-trade legislation is one of the least expensive options for controlling greenhouse gases, experts said.

So the assertion that cap and trade leads to higher energy prices is reasonable but depends on the specifics of a plan. The chamber cannot point to an instance where Kaine directly supported a particular measure that would raise energy bills, which is necessary context.

There is an element of truth and a great deal of hyperbole in the chamber’s claim that Kaine supported higher energy bills for families",Mostly False,"August 21, 2012"
"After the 9/11 terrorist attacks grounded commercial air traffic, ""there was a temperature drop while the airplanes weren't flying, for the week afterwards.""","In their first debate last month, three Republicans seeking Rhode Island’s 2nd Congressional District seat -- Michael J. Gardiner, Michael G. Riley and Kara D. Russo -- were discussing the role fossil fuels should play in a national energy strategy when the issue of climate change emerged.

When Russo questioned whether climate change even existed, considering there is ""so much . . . propaganda about global warming,"" Gardiner, a Providence lawyer, said human activity had ""clearly"" affected climate.

As an example, he pointed to the three days after the 9/11 terrorist attacks when all commercial planes were grounded over the United States.

""We did see in 9/11, we did see I believe there was a temperature drop while the airplanes weren't flying, for the week afterwards, that there was an average temperature drop,"" he said.  ""So I think clearly there are man-made effects.""

We wondered whether Gardiner knew of some new research confirming the much-discussed theory in the 11 years since the attacks.

The theory caught wide attention a year after the attacks when University of Wisconsin-Whitewater Prof. David Travis and two colleagues published a study -- here’s a summary -- that found that the absence of jet vapor trails in the skies during the three-day flying hiatus had a climatological effect.

Travis and his colleagues had collected the daily high and low temperatures for those days from 4,000 weather stations across the country and compared the data with the same three-day period in each year from 1971 through 2000.

They determined that without contrails acting as artificial clouds trapping in heat (and to a lesser extent blocking the sun) the average daily temperature range over the continent had widened by about two degrees. In other words, the average low temperature dropped a bit while the average high temperature rose slightly.

Since then other studies have questioned whether the lack of contrails in the skies during those three days after the attacks actually played any role in the widened temperature variations that Travis reported. They have suggested that the temperature change Travis found might have been a coincidence -- the result of unusually clear weather during the period the jets were grounded.

When contacted by PolitiFact Rhode Island, Gardiner said he was relying on past news stories when he made his claim that the temperature had dropped while air flight was suspended.

After reading those news stories again, Gardiner acknowledged in an e-mail that he had misspoken during the candidates’ debate; Travis’ study showed a widened daily temperature range in both directions following the terrorist attacks -- not just a drop in temperature -- and, said Gardiner,  ""indeed there is controversy surrounding the observations . . . ""

Said Gardiner, ""I do a better job of illuminating a path for discussion and thought than 'nailing' a precise scientifically unassailable statement.""

Still, while Gardiner stated incorrectly what climatological event had occurred in the days after 9/11, his point for raising it was well-taken.

Gardiner’s underlying point that humans are affecting the climate is accepted by the vast majority of scientists. But he misstated the conclusions of a study that itself has been called into question",Mostly False,"August 1, 2012"
"The United States can immediately tap a domestic energy resource of ""more than 1.5 trillion barrels of oil, six times more than Saudi Arabia.""","As Wisconsinites geared up to hit the highway for the Fourth of July, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde declared American energy independence as easy as 1, 2, 3.

Here’s the solution to high gas prices and overreliance on foreign oil, a
Hovde campaign news release said on July 2, 2012:

1.  ""Immediately tap into America’s natural resources: More than 1.5 trillion barrels of oil (six times more than Saudi Arabia); 272 trillion cubic feet of natural gas; and more than half the world’s oil shale supply.""

2. ""End the moratorium on domestic drilling on public lands.""

3. ""Build the Keystone XL pipeline.""

There has been much debate about drilling on public lands and the Keystone XL pipeline, which would move oil sands crude from Canada to Gulf of Mexico refineries. But there’s been little discussion of the claim that America has an untapped domestic oil source that tops oil-rich Saudi Arabia by a factor of six.

Is Hovde right?

Hovde’s campaign pointed us to the Republican website for the House Natural Resources Committee, chaired by U.S. Rep. Doc Hastings (R-Washington).

""According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) the U.S. holds more than half of the world’s oil shale resources,"" the site says. ""The most recent estimates (April, 2009) show the region may hold more than 1.5 trillion barrels of oil – six times Saudi Arabia’s proven resources, and enough to provide the United States with energy for the next 200 years.""

Hovde, the committee website and the USGS are talking about the same thing -- the Green River Formation in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming. But each is using some critically different ways to describe it.

The Green River Formation is considered the world’s largest oil shale resource, but only sporadic attempts have been made to explore it -- typically when oil prices spike.

The reason: It’s not crude oil that lies beneath the surface, as in Saudi Arabia. It’s oil shale, a solid organic compound that can be converted to oil only when heated to great temperatures. The USGS made clear when it announced its findings in 2009.

Huge obstacles including costs, technology and environmental concerns have stood in the way.

Let’s start with the non-partisan source, the Geological Survey. Pressed by Congress during a gas-price spike several years ago, the survey analyzed the oil shale resource and determined the Colorado section of the formation by far the most promising.

They estimated that 1.525 trillion barrels of ""in-place oil shale resources"" lie in the Colorado section. That’s the number Hovde and the Republican website mention.

But each shortens that to ""oil"" -- and that’s a big difference. The Geological Survey describes oil shale as ""pre oil"" because it is not ready-made crude.

And the agency’s assessment made an important point: No economically viable extraction method is currently available in the United States, because the process is so technologically and environmentally challenging compared to conventional extraction of actual crude oil.

""Much of the resource in Colorado, where the richest deposits of high grade oil shale exist, are buried deep enough that mining is considered impractical or prohibitively difficult and expensive,"" said Justin Birdwell, a USGS research engineer studying the resource, in an interview. The focus, therefore has been on underground processing technologies, which are unproven.

Given this backdrop, the agency concluded in 2009 that it’s unknown how much of that 1.5 trillion barrels is recoverable. That’s still true today, although the agency is developing estimates. Recovery of oil is years or decades away, certainly not ""immediate"" as Hovde described it.

Additionally, when it comes to the Saudi Arabia comparison, Hovde runs into a major apples-to-oranges problem when he says the 1.5 trillion ""barrels of oil"" in the Green River Formation is ""six times more"" than in Saudi Arabia.

He is comparing Saudi Arabia’s 266 billion of ""proved resources"" with the 1.5 trillion in the Green River Formation -- but the latter number is only an estimate of the total ""in-place"" in the formation, without regard to the ability to get it out or get a viable price for it.

It’s a ""major distinction,"" as a Congressional Research Service paper on US fossil fuel resources noted in 2010.

""Proved reserves are those amounts of oil, natural gas, or coal that have been discovered and defined, typically by drilling wells or other exploratory measures, and which can be economically recovered,"" the study said.

In terms of proved reserves, the US has 20.7 billion barrels -- 13 times less than Saudi Arabia, according to the latest data from the Energy Information Administration, a US government agency.

The Republican website Hovde cites was more precise and cautious than the candidate. It said the region ""may hold"" more than 1.5 trillion barrels, and explicitly compared that to the Saudi’s ""proven"" resources.

Hovde omitted the qualifiers.

In any case, according to two Congressional Research Service studies, oil shale ""makes poor feedstock for making gasoline, so it might primarily be a source of other liquid middle distillate fuels such as jet fuel or diesel oil, fuels for which there is significant national demand.""

Finally, Hovde’s claim reminded us of a February 2012 item by PolitiFact National that rated Mostly False a claim by Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich. He said that by one estimate the United States  may have ""three times as much oil in the United States as there is in Saudi Arabia.""

That item noted the same apples-to-oranges problem in the comparison.

Our rating

Hovde suggested that we immediately tap into America’s natural resources, which he said are ""more than 1.5 trillion barrels of oil (six times more than Saudi Arabia).""

Hovde referred to a massive western United States formation of oil shale, and there’s a kernel of truth in that government officials estimate that 1.5 trillion barrels are contained there.

But Hovde omits a critical fact: He’s comparing that uncertain oil shale resource with Saudi oil reserves that have been discovered and defined and can be extracted economically. It’s unknown what the western formation will yield, and it certainly won’t come immediately",Mostly False,"July 12, 2012"
"U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson ""chose to side with President Obama"" against the Keystone pipeline","U.S. Rep Connie Mack is fired up about the Keystone XL oil pipeline, a divisive energy project he’s made the heart of his U.S. Senate campaign.

The Republican congressman wants you, the voter, to be mad, too. Specifically, mad at President Barack Obama and Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, the ""lockstep liberals"" whom he accuses of holding up the project.

Freedom PAC, a pro-Mack super PAC, is out with an ad that attacks Obama and Nelson over Keystone. (The ad is on the Web; it’s not yet running on television, though.)  

""President Obama said no to the Keystone XL pipeline,"" the ad says. ""That’s saying no to lower gas prices, no to more jobs, no to greater energy security. Sen. Bill Nelson chose to side with President Obama over the people of Florida. Now you have a choice. Connie Mack supports Keystone XL.""

PolitiFact has already debunked misleading claims about the project’s potential to create 20,000 jobs and ""immediately"" lower gas prices.

Nelson’s record on Keystone, though, is new ground.

First, the vitals. We’re talking about a 1,700-mile pipeline that would transport oil sands from Canada to refineries in Texas and Oklahoma. It would shoot off of an existing Keystone pipeline connecting Canada and Illinois (USA Today offered this illustration).

The most controversial part of Keystone XL is the proposed northern route, which environmentalists and some Republican Nebraskans fear may damage sensitive lands and an important aquifer. Business and union groups are on the other side, touting its potential for desperately needed construction jobs and reducing the country’s dependence on Middle Eastern oil.

Because the pipeline crosses an international border, it needs approval from the Obama administration.

Here are the recent, relevant milestones: Nov. 10, 2011: Following mounting pressure from environmentalists, the Obama administration announces it will put off a decision on the permit until 2013, pending more review of environmental implications. Dec. 23, 2011: Obama signs a law temporarily keeping in place lower payroll taxes. It also contains an unrelated Keystone measure, which forces a decision on the permit within 60 days. Jan. 18, 2012: Citing the ""rushed and arbitrary"" two-month deadline, Obama decides not to approve the permit for TransCanada, the principal company behind the pipeline. Obama says his decision ""is not a judgment on the merits of the pipeline."" March 8, 2012: The Senate votes on two Keystone-related amendments on a highway funding bill. Both fail. A Republican-sponsored measure would have circumvented Obama and allowed Congress to authorize the pipeline (failed 56-42). One sponsored by Democrats would have prevented exports of oil from Canada transported via the pipeline (failed 33-65). March 22, 2012: Obama travels to Cushing, Okla., where he announces his approval of the development of the project’s southern leg, which was supposed to start in June anyway. Republicans criticize him, saying the leg does not require presidential approval since it does not cross a national border. May 4, 2012: The State Department announces it has received a new application from TransCanada for the northern segment of the pipeline connecting the Canadian border to an existing pipeline in Steele City, Neb. The department must decide if granting a permit is in the national interest. Contrary to the pro-Mack ad’s ""they killed it"" vibe, the $7-billion project isn’t dead. Construction on the southern part of the pipeline extension is underway, and the State Department will reevaluate TransCanada’s new application for the northern leg.

It’s also hard to gauge Obama’s intentions from his actions. Did he say ""no"" to the pipeline, as the commercial claims from the beginning? Or do his actions really point to ""not now,"" since he has praised parts of it?

Nelson’s actions are also not crystal-clear either, and he has not said much publicly about it.

In December, he joined his colleagues in unanimous approval of a temporary extension of the pay roll tax cuts that included the Republican provision forcing Obama to evaluate the project within two months. But that was less a vote on the merits of Keystone and more about extending payroll tax cuts.

In March, Nelson split his votes on two party-line Keystone amendments. He voted against the GOP-backed measure that would have circumvented several procedures to speed up Keystone. Those include state permitting, national interest determination, environmental impact and tribal sovereignty, said Jason Kowalski, policy director of 350.org, which opposes the project.

But minutes earlier, he voted for the Democratic-inserted provision preventing exports of Keystone oil.

It’s important to note that both amendments were designed to fail. By taking votes anyway, senators could tell voters they tried to move along the job-creating project.

Nelson’s team insists he is for it, with conditions.

In a March statement, Nelson said, ""I support the pipeline – just not in an area where it runs over an entire region’s water supply, which the folks in Nebraska don’t want either. … Additionally, Congress needs to enact a requirement that the oil shipped from Canada must be kept in our domestic supply and not sold to foreign countries.""

The head of Freedom PAC isn’t buying that. Political consultant Matt Williams, who’s in charge of the PAC, said by email that Nelson ""took the position the White House was lobbying senators to take"" when he voted not to expedite the Keystone pipeline. (POLITICO has more background on Obama’s lobbying efforts against the GOP-led amendment, which failed despite 11 Democratic senators thwarting Obama’s wishes and voting to bypass him.)

We asked Kowalski from 350.org for his take on where Nelson stands. He said it’s become a political issue, since Congress doesn’t usually direct regulatory actions on pipelines.

""Sen. Nelson has been consistent with Obama on this issue,"" he said.

Our ruling

Overall, the ad is laden with misleading facts we’ve already checked. The super PAC comes closer to the truth when it says Nelson and Obama are on the same side, but it still lacks details and context for viewers.

First of all, the project isn’t dead. The principal owners just reapplied for a permit. We know that happened after the ad debuted, but it wasn’t really dead then, either.

Nelson says he is for the pipeline, but he did follow Obama’s wishes by voting against expediting the permit in a close, bipartisan Senate vote in March. His record also shows a vote in favor of Keystone, though voters should understand its part of political strategy in an election year.

The bottom line is that neither Nelson nor Obama has come out definitively against the project. They’ve managed to side with environmentalists -- for now -- by taking action against it this year, but the door is open for future support.

"""I have always said that I would be for drilling.""","U.S. Rep. Connie Mack, running in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate, held an event at a Miami gas station to urge the public to sign his petition calling for the Keystone XL Pipeline.

""I have always said that I would be for drilling,"" Mack said on April 5, 2012, according to the Miami Herald’s Naked Politics blog. ""But I think that’s an issue the state should have a say in – in determining how far it’s going to be off the coast of Florida. We ought to allow the state to have a say in that decision.""

The report pointed out several past quotes from Mack bashing proposals for drilling close to Florida.

We decided to put the issue to our Truth-O-Meter: Was Mack mischaracterizing his own past statements when he said he ""always"" was for drilling? When he wasn't for drilling As we investigated, we found that when then-state Rep. Mack ran for Congress in 2004, he pledged to maintain the ban on drilling off Florida’s coast. And if there was a high point to him sticking to that pledge, it was 2005.

That year, Mack issued multiple statements criticizing a proposal to allow drilling closer to Florida, saying that it would hurt Florida’s ""pristine"" or ""fragile"" coastline and describing it as ""risky"" and ""reckless.""

In a statement on Sept. 28, 2005, Mack called himself a ""longtime opponent of drilling off Florida’s coast.""  Yes, Congress needed to take action to lower gas prices, he said. ""But allowing drilling off Florida’s pristine coastline won’t reduce America’s pain at the pump. Instead of taking steps that will expose Florida’s fragile environment and our economy to severe and irreparable harm, we would be better served by expanding America’s refining capabilities, investing in new energy technologies, furthering commercial and consumer adoption of more energy efficient products, and increasing conservation.""

We found similar statements from Mack in 2005 on Sept. 29, Oct. 3, Oct. 24, Oct. 26, Nov. 3 and Nov. 10. Cracks in the opposition Mack continued his opposition in 2006, saying in May, ""I applaud my colleagues for saying (no to) reckless plans that could have allowed drilling as close as three miles off Florida’s shores.""

But 2006 was the year that the Florida delegation started to split on drilling. Before then, the delegation had nearly unanimous bipartisan opposition to drilling, said Mark Ferrulo, executive director of Progress Florida, who has tracked drilling legislation since the 1990s. (The exception: U.S. Rep. John Mica, R-Winter Park. ""His brother is a lobbyist for the oil industry, and (he) doesn’t have a coastline that was threatened,"" Ferrulo said.)

In June 2006, a vote was held on the the Deep Oceans Energy Resources Act, to create a smaller, 50-mile buffer on Florida’s coast. Fourteen of Florida’s 25-member House delegation voted in favor of the smaller zone, but Mack voted against it. He said in a press release that he voted against it because an amendment wasn’t included in the bill that would have given Florida control over drilling decisions.

In December, the House overwhelmingly voted for a bill that was considered a compromise: It opened up 8.3 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico to drilling while protecting Florida’s 125-mile buffer.

Mack explained his support: ""I’m pleased the House has adopted important legislation that will codify new and stronger protections against offshore drilling for Florida’s Gulf Coast. Without enacting these protections, Florida faced a precarious future on the question of drilling off our fragile shore.

""While I would have preferred a solution that empowered states like Florida to determine their own destiny on this important issue, today’s legislation provides a sound solution that will protect our precious environment and our economy.""

A switch in position

Flash forward to the summer of 2008. Consumers were angry about $4-a-gallon gas, and the phrase ""drill, baby, drill"" was a Republican mantra. Presidential candidate John McCain called for lifting the federal moratorium along the Outer Continental Shelf and giving states incentives to lift the ban. Some Republicans, including then-Gov. Charlie Crist, who was a contender to be McCain’s vice president, and U.S. Sen. Mel Martinez, R-Fla., ditched their previous opposition. And so did Mack.

Mack told Fox News on June 16 that the United States needed to expand domestic production, including drilling off the coast of Florida. 

He explained his change of mind in a June 17 press release: ""For years I have said states should have the right to decide whether or not they want to allow drilling off their shores. But circumstances have changed, I have changed, and I believe the people of Florida have changed. We’re facing a serious energy emergency, and we need to take real steps to bolster our energy independence and security. The people of Florida deserve the right to decide whether to drill off our coast."" The political winds had shifted. ""Prior to now, this was not an issue that elected officials really wanted to engage in,"" said Justin Sayfie, a former spokesman for former Gov. Jeb Bush, at the time. ""I just think it speaks volumes about the pain at the pump that motorists are feeling."" Then came the Deepwater Horizon explosion and spill in 2010. Mack took a cautious approach, saying before a decision is made on banning offshore drilling, the country must understand what went wrong. But generally, he still supported offshore drilling, saying in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference that domestic drilling needed to continue ""across the United States and in our waters.""

Mack campaign spokesman David James sent us a statement acknowledging that Mack’s views have ""evolved"" on drilling.

""Connie has been a steadfast proponent of a strong national security and has always supported increasing our domestic energy supply by drilling in ANWR (the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge), and he has been a champion of building the Keystone XL Pipeline,"" James said. ""At the same time there's no dispute that Connie has always wanted to make certain that we protect Florida's shores. That hasn't changed. But four years ago, in the summer of 2008, Connie announced that his position with respect to drilling off Florida's coast evolved as our national energy security needs changed too. That's been well documented. And those needs have only grown all the more important.""

We are focusing our evaluation of Mack on drilling near Florida -- not Alaska -- since he is a congressman running for Senate in Florida. But we will briefly note his position on ANWR. For the years that drilling in ANWR appears on the scorecards of the League of Conservation Voters, it shows that Mack consistently voted as the League calls it ""anti-environment"" -- including in 2005 and 2006 and 2011. Mack was absent for that vote in 2008, but in an article that year he denounced a plan to impose restrictions on drilling in ANWR.

In 2012, Florida’s congressional delegation remains split on more drilling off the coast of Florida.

""We have never gotten back to a unified front of opposition against expanding drilling,"" Ferrulo said.

Our ruling

Mack said, ""I have always said that I would be for drilling. But I think that’s an issue the state should have a say in – in determining how far it’s going to be off the coast of Florida. We ought to allow the state to have a say in that decision.""

But Mack didn’t always say he was in favor of drilling. In 2005, he repeatedly said he was against allowing drilling closer to Florida’s shores. He has since changed his stance, as did many other Republicans in 2008 amid high gas prices and a presidential campaign. ""Always"" means at all times -- not sometimes, or the past few years, or in Alaska. At one time, Mack very much opposed drilling off Florida's coast. His comment that he's ""always"" been for drilling misrepresents his actual record on a very high-profile issue in the state of Florida",False Pants on Fire,"April 25, 2012"
"In the past three years, ""we've added enough new oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth and then some.""","President Barack Obama kept up the drumbeat for his ""all of the above"" energy strategy with a speech in the White House Rose Garden.

Addressing criticism that he has stood in the way of domestic production, in the April 17, 2012, speech Obama said the opposite is true.

""There are politicians who say that if we just drilled more, then gas prices would come down right away. What they don’t say is that we have been drilling more. Under my administration, America is producing more oil than at any time in the last eight years. We’ve opened up new areas for exploration. We've quadrupled the number of operating rigs to a record high. We've added enough new oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth and then some,"" Obama said, with a nod to middle-school science class.

We've been hearing a lot about oil production recently and have checked several statements from Obama and Republicans on the matter. Here, we decided to check something we haven't heard before -- that the United States has added enough oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth since Obama took office.

First, it's important to note that it's unusual for presidents to become involved in decisions about pipeline construction, which is largely driven by whether the oil and gas industry is willing to make the large investment, an expert told us. Obama rejected an expedited plan pushed by Republicans to build the Keystone XL pipeline, but he has also emphasized the importance of pipeline construction. He has said that domestic production exceeds current pipeline capacity and in March signed an executive order streamlining the permitting and construction process of a new crude oil pipeline to Gulf Coast refineries. For this item, we’re not addressing whether Obama deserves credit for the pipeline because of the limited role presidents have. But we can check whether that much pipeline has been added. To back up Obama's claim, the White House pointed us to statistics from the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, which regulates pipelines.

The DOT figures were last updated in April 2012 with mileage figures through 2010. So they do not include pipeline that was added last year or this year.

Here's a comparison of the mileage at the end of 2008 (right before Obama took office) and the end of 2010:

Crude oil
2008: 50,963 miles
2010: 54,728 +3,765

Petroleum products
2008: 61,599
2010: 64,752 + 3,153

Natural gas transmission
2008: 303,182
2010: 304,691 + 1,509

Natural gas distribution
2008: 2,074,513
2010: 2,095,690 + 21,177

That adds up to 2,490,257 oil and gas pipeline miles in 2008, and 2,519,861 in 2010.

So that's 29,604 additional miles of pipeline. According to NASA, the equatorial circumference of the Earth is 24,873.6 miles. Obama's comparison is accurate, and given that the latest figures only cover through 2010, the real, current figure is likely higher.

We asked two experts if the year-to-year comparison of pipeline miles is a valid measure and if anything else should be considered.

Jay Hakes, former director of the Energy Information Administration under President Bill Clinton, said the data are reliable and ""as near as I can tell, the assertion is well documented and correct.""

Tadeusz Patzek, chair of the Department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, pointed out that many miles of those pipelines are ""field/project gathering lines of small diameter and small throughput"" -- not large transmission lines many of us think of. He's right. According to the DOT numbers, 21,177 miles of the new pipeline are listed as natural gas distribution lines. Still, such lines are ""a necessary piece"" of the whole system. Said Patzek: ""Without the small stuff you’re not going to increase the flow rate through the large."" Is 29,604 miles over three years a lot? For some perspective, we looked at the miles added during the last three years of George W. Bush's presidency. They tell a wholly different story: 63,243 new miles of small natural gas distrbution lines -- more than Obama's overall total. But crude oil? Just 756 miles. Petroleum products: 808 fewer miles in 2005 than in 2007. We're not suggesting Obama has done better than Bush in this regard. The comparison simply reinforces the point that oil and gas supply and demand, and the industry's response to it, results from decisions made far from the White House.

Our ruling

Obama said the U.S. has added enough pipeline in the last three years to circle the Earth ""and then some."" He is right about the mileage, though it includes not just large interstate transmission lines but also small pipes that collect gas from groups of wells and feed to the larger lines. But those pipelines are a link in the grid, and Obama didn't specify only large transmission pipeline.

The statement is accurate",True,"April 23, 2012"
"Gas prices have doubled because ""Obama opposed exploring for energy in Alaska. He gave millions of tax dollars to Solyndra, which then went bankrupt. And he blocked the Keystone pipeline. So we will all pay more at the pump.""","Gas prices are fueling a drag race of political ads on Florida television. In one lane, it’s spiking gas prices under President Barack Obama. In the other, it’s ""Big Oil’s"" support for Mitt Romney.

We’ve fact-checked several claims from these ads. But for this fact-check, we’re returning to an ad put out by the American Energy Alliance, an advocacy arm of the Institute for Energy Research, which is connected to the oil industry.

""Since Obama became president, gas prices have nearly doubled,"" the ad says. ""Obama opposed exploring for energy in Alaska. He gave millions of tax dollars to Solyndra, which then went bankrupt. And he blocked the Keystone pipeline. So we will all pay more at the pump.

""Obama's energy secretary said we need to, quote, 'boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe.’ That's $9 a gallon. … Tell Obama, we can’t afford his failing energy policies.""

We’ve fact-checked whether Obama opposed exploring for energy in Alaska (Half True -- he opposed it in some parts), whether he gave millions of dollars to Solyndra (a federal program for alternative energy did), and whether Energy Secretary Steven Chu said gas prices should be at European levels (yes, but it was before he joined the administration).

The ad is right that gas prices have doubled (more than doubled, in fact) since Obama took office in 2009. The average price for gasoline was $1.90 in January 2009; now it's $3.98, according to the Energy Information Administration.

Here, we wanted to explore the ad’s larger point, that Obama’s policies on Alaska, Solyndra and Keystone are contributing to those higher gas prices.

Energy exploration in Alaska

The ad’s first claim is that Obama ""opposed exploring for energy in Alaska."" We found in a previous fact-check that while Obama opposes exploration in some parts of Alaska, his administration has approved drilling in other parts.

Specifically, Obama has opposed drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a large nature preserve (roughly the size of South Carolina) managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The refuge is a protected area for wildlife including caribou, polar bears and gray wolves.

But the Obama administration recently approved a plan for Shell Oil to drill in the Chukchi Sea, off the northwest coast of Alaska, giving the green light to Shell’s contingency plans for cleaning up any spills. The company called that a ""major milestone"" and said it hopes to drill up to three wells there this summer.

The company also has plans for two wells in the Beaufort Sea, off Alaska’s northern coast. The administration approved Shell’s disaster response plan for that area in March.

But if Obama had given a green light to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, would gas prices be lower today? Not according to the evidence we reviewed.  

A 2008 study done by the independent Energy Information Administration for the late U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, found that it would take 10 years to actually produce oil from the area. And that’s only if there were no protracted legal battles, environmental challenge or delays in getting government permits.

So even if Obama had approved drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge on the day he was inaugurated, there’s no way oil in the ground there would have made it to gas pumps in 2012.

Solyndra

Heard of Solyndra? It was a solar panel manufacturer that won government loan guarantees but then went belly up. We looked into Solyndra when we fact-checked an earlier political ad that said Obama showered special favors on his political friends. The particular charge of cronyism got a Mostly False from the Truth-O-Meter. Solyndra's loan application predated the Obama administration, and career Energy Department officials handled the deal.

We did find that the administration tried to hurry the process, but the evidence pointed to the Obama team wanting to brag about green jobs efforts, not to enrich political cronies. Many private investors also lost money on the Solyndra deal.

Solyndra, based in Silicon Valley, formed in 2005 to build and sell a unique type of solar cell, cylinders that were cheaper and worked better than traditional flat panels. Designed for rooftops, the panels were intended to generate electricity to power buildings like warehouses and retail stores. (Read more details about Solyndra’s rise and fall here.)

Solyndra walked away from $529 million in federal loans, according to the most recent numbers from the U.S. Department of Energy. But Solyndra was an energy company that focused on generating electricity for buildings -- not gasoline for cars. We searched for any connection between Solyndra and gas prices or even just cars and came up empty.

The Keystone XL pipeline

The ad says Obama blocked the Keystone pipeline. Obama did block the Keystone XL, an addition to an existing pipeline so that oil sands (also known as tar sands or bituminous sands) could be moved from Canada to refineries near Houston, Texas, and the Gulf of Mexico.

Because the pipeline crosses the U.S. border, the State Department must sign off. Back in November, the State Department said it would delay a decision while environmental concerns about the pipeline were addressed. Back then, the pipeline was set to cross over drinking water sources in Nebraska, and people were asking TransCanada, the company behind the pipeline project, for an alternate route.

The company has since said it would work with officials to shift the route. But environmentalists have still said the pipeline shouldn’t be built at all, because oil sands are harder to clean up when spilled and cost more to turn into gasoline.

Then Congress put new deadlines into play, passing a law that said the Obama administration had to make a decision on the pipeline by February. Obama said that wasn’t enough time for a thorough environmental review and rejected the pipeline.

The ad again suggests the delay of the pipeline is somehow responsible for today’s high gas prices. Since the pipeline was only proposed in 2008 with a then-projected opening of 2013, it’s hard to see how gas prices in 2012 would be lower. (PolitiFact Ohio also looked in detail the question of whether Keystone approval would cause gas prices to drop in the near term; they ruled that claim False.) Whether Keystone will reduce gas prices in the future is a contested point that we won’t settle in this fact-check. TransCanada’s analyst said it would bring down gas prices by 3.5 to 4 cents per gallon, according to Forbes. But environmentalists have seized on arguments that the pipeline could drive gas prices up, by giving Canadian oil an outlet to world markets through the Gulf of Mexico and bypassing U.S. customers. (The Christian Science Monitor explored these issues in some detail.) Greg Laskoski, a senior petroleum analyst with GasBuddy.com, said Keystone had the closest connection to gas prices, but even that connection was far from simple and more oriented toward future prices. Lower-priced Canadian oil could be of some benefit to refineries in the United States, but that assumes it stays in the United States and isn’t sold to foreign countries.

""It’s not as simplistic as some of these sound bites make it out to be,"" he said.

None of the above

We contacted the American Energy Alliance to ask them about the connection between these issues and today’s gas prices. Spokesperson Benjamin Cole said that Obama’s overall policies are hostile to the domestic oil and gas industry, and that markets have reacted with increased prices. (We should note that’s a more subtle point than is made in the 30-second ad.)

Not everyone sees it that way, though. Obama’s energy policies have been ""surprisingly constructive,"" said Michael Levi, an expert on energy with the Council for Foreign Relations, in a March op-ed for ForeignPolicy.com. In an article titled ""The Driller in Chief,"" Levi argued that Obama’s regulations are aimed at ""dumb and preventable accidents"" that would ""do far more to set back U.S. oil and gas development than some smart minimum standards set out at the federal level.""

Getting back to today’s pump prices, the experts we spoke with were dubious about the impact of any of the above issues -- drilling in Alaska, Solyndra, the Keystone pipeline -- on today’s gas prices.

Gas prices reflect the cost of oil on world markets and tend to reflect long-term trends, expectations for economic growth and geopolitical concerns. One example: Rising tensions with Iran, a major oil exporter.

""Looking at this year, what’s affected prices are the issues with Iran,"" said Jessica Brady, a spokesperson for the travel organization AAA, which monitors gas prices.

What about drilling in Alaska, Solyndra and Keystone? ""Really, none of those three issues have had an impact on the gas prices we’ve been paying,"" she said.

Laskoski of GasBuddy.com said a president’s power over gas prices comes mostly from reducing regulations for domestic exploration and refining, as well as discouraging speculation in the oil market. But even those powers are somewhat limited.

""Those are things that can be done that can bring reductions (in prices),"" Laskoski said. ""All of those things combined might help lower gas prices, but I don’t know how you can quantify it.""

Our ruling

The American Energy Alliance connects today’s higher gas prices to a grab bag of Obama’s energy policies. We can’t see how the failing of Solyndra -- a solar panel company that focused on powering commercial buildings -- has any connection with today’s gas prices. On Alaska, if Obama had approved drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (which, to be clear, he opposes), actual production would still be at least six years away, and that’s a best-case scenario. The Keystone pipeline, meanwhile, is more directly related to gas prices, but even that project would have more impact on future gas prices, not today’s higher prices",False,"April 19, 2012"
"Says President Obama's decision to not issue a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline meant ""we were denied the ability immediately to reduce prices at the pump.""","Both houses of the Ohio General Assembly approved resolutions in the past 10 months urging Congress to ask Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to approve the controversial TransCanada Keystone XL pipeline project from Alberta to Oklahoma.

The Ohio House acted last June. The Senate passed its resolution in January, as President Obama announced he was putting the project on hold by extending the deadline one year to rule on a permit for pipeline operator TransCanada.

One of the sponsors of House Resolution 97, State Rep. Mike Dovilla, a Republican from Berea who represents the 18th District, wrote to the Strongsville edition of Patch.com that he would introduce a new resolution supporting the pipeline.

Delaying the project hurt U.S. energy security and cost ""the ability to create over 20,000 construction and manufacturing jobs,"" he said. Obama's decision to not issue a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline meant ""we were denied the ability immediately to reduce prices at the pump.""

With the price of gas bubbling under $4 a gallon and becoming a political football, PolitiFact Ohio was interested, immediately, in his statement that permit approval would immediately reduce pump prices. We asked Dovilla's office how he backed it up.

They steered us to the U.S. Energy Information Agency and its statement, ""The single biggest factor in the price of gasoline is the cost of the crude oil from which it is made."" Not approving the pipeline, they said, citing the State Department, would lead to increased imports of oil from unreliable sources, leading to increased speculation that contributes to price fluctuation.

Dovilla quoted a memo of last June 22 from the Department of Energy's deputy assistant secretary for policy analysis, saying that Keystone XL would eliminate transportation constraints. ""Gasoline prices in all markets served by PADD I and III refiners would decrease, including the Midwest,"" the memo said. (PADD stands for Petroleum Administration for Defense District. PADD I is the East Coast, PADD III is the Gulf Coast.)

Supporting Dovilla's statement that prices would drop immediately, his office cited economist and commentator Larry Kudlow, who asserted in 2008 that oil prices dropped more than 6 percent ""on news that President Bush was moving forward with plans to develop new areas in the Outer Continental Shelf despite the fact that the oil would not make it to market for 7 to 10 years.""

""Oil prices,"" Dovilla's spokesman said, ""will react to an announcement regarding future supply long before that supply is actually delivered.""

We looked further. We found that the Department of Energy memo of last June came in response to a paper by energy economist Philip Verleger, an adviser to the Ford and Carter administrations, who heads a Colorado consulting firm on oil market economics. Illuminating the debate among industry analysts about Keystone's likely impact, Verleger says the pipeline would increase gas prices, particularly in the upper Midwest, by about 10 cents per gallon.

The companies involved with Keystone told Canadian regulators that the pipeline will allow Canadians to manipulate prices and add at least $4 billion to the U.S. fuel bill annually, Verleger said. He called Keystone ""a long, torturous way to move crude oil from Canada to China.""

His assessment was echoed in a report in January from the Cornell University Global Labor Institute and by a new study from the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit environmental advocacy group.

Both said that the Keystone XL pipeline is designed to divert heavy crude tar sands oil from the Midwest -- where it has overwhelmed refinery demand and depressed the price of crude -- to Gulf Coast refineries, where much of it can be exported to international markets. They quoted the testimony and studies of TransCanada, the principal company behind the pipeline, in saying that the diversion of heavy crude oil to the Gulf would cut ""discounting"" in the glutted Midwest and bring Canadian oil producers an added $2 billion to $3.9 billion annually.

Our colleagues at the Washington Post's Fact Checker, examining another statement about Keystone XL and gasoline, noted that TransCanada itself makes no claims that the project will reduce prices -- only that it will not increase prices. The company's Keystone XL fact sheet says: ""The price of international oil prices has no impact on the operation of our pipeline and we do not profit from changing market changes,"" TransCanada said. ""Prices are set on a global level.""

Ray Perryman, an economist employed by TransCanada, told Forbes magazine that the pipeline would bring down gasoline prices by 3.5 cents to 4 cents a gallon once fully operational.

Moody's, the investment ratings firm, had a lower estimate: 1.6 cents per gallon.

Even those small reductions would not come until the pipeline was operational, however. The Fact Checker, which was examining the question of whether Keystone XL would lower prices at all, said: ""We could not find any experts to say that the prospect of the pipeline being built in the future would somehow impact the price of gasoline today.""

That would seem to settle the question of whether the pipeline's approval would reduce prices immediately -- except for Dovilla's citation of Larry Kudlow about President Bush influencing prices in 2008. What happened then?

In July 2008, Bush lifted a presidential ban on offshore oil drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf that was established by his father. It carried symbolic and political significance in an election year, but had no immediate effect on exploration because of prohibitions by Congress against offshore drilling.

Petroleum prices did drop, but they were continuing what was becoming a dramatic retreat from record high prices. Energy analysts and economists pointed to one reason for it: recession.

""Oil markets, analysts said, have been spun around by lower consumption in a U.S. economy weakened by financial instability and by a change in sentiment among financial players, many of whom are scurrying to stem losses or protect much-needed capital,"" the Washington Post reported at the time.

""The overwhelming cause of the collapse in oil prices has been the faltering world economy, which has fueled the drop in consumption,"" the Post reported.

In other words, Bush's announcement was coincidental but not causative.

Energy analyst Joseph M. Dukert, senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and former president of the U.S. Association for Energy Economics, expressed it more plainly to the liberal research group Media Matters when it looked at a similar claim:

""Most energy economists applauded President Bush's action in regard to offshore drilling,"" he said, ""but suggesting that this 'caused' the precipitous drop in global oil prices is akin to the rooster's boast that his crowing brought the sun up.""

Even former Bush White House chief economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin discounted a president's impact on oil prices: ""You can‘t change the oil price very much with the U.S. exploration. It certainly can‘t change it quickly,"" he said in a television discussion.

And that returns us to the statement that Obama's decision to not issue a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline meant ""we were denied the ability immediately to reduce prices at the pump.""

We found debate among oil analysts over the effect the pipeline would have on gasoline prices, especially in the Midwest, where some expect it would drive prices up. And while estimates varied, our research (and that by our colleagues at the Washington Post) found that those experts didn’t expect there would a price impact until after the pipeline were built. Even TransCanada, the company behind the pipeline, expressed doubts about any price impact, and an economist with the company projected that wouldn’t happen until after the line was operational.

That’s a far cry from Dovilla’s claim of immediacy",False,"April 17, 2012"
"The Keystone oil pipeline ""would employ 20,000 people in the United States.""","Backers of a massive oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico are telling voters that it will flood the U.S. with jobs.

President Barack Obama denied a permit to build the 1,700-mile Keystone XL pipeline in January amid bitter debate over whether it would damage environmentally sensitive lands. The pipeline may still win approval, however, and some lawmakers are trying to push it forward.

One of them is U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga. In a Feb. 23 speech at Dalton State College, Isakson said the pipeline could employ enough people to populate Decatur.

""From Day One, this project [the Keystone pipeline] would employ 20,000 people in the United States,"" Isakson said.  

This jobs figure is a well-worn talking point for pipeline supporters. Georgia U.S. Reps. Paul Broun and Phil Gingrey used it. U.S. House Speaker John Boehner and House Republican Leader Eric Cantor said it as well.

We decided to take a closer look.

We reviewed news accounts, read analyses of the company’s job creation figures, interviewed a spokesman for TransCanada, the firm hoping to build the pipeline, and consulted critics.

We found that while the TransCanada estimate does say that 20,000 ""Americans"" will be directly employed by the project, that’s not what the company’s chief executive has said.

Furthermore, TransCanada’s numbers clash with lower estimates from critics and the U.S. Department of State.

TransCanada has said in a press release that those 20,000 jobs include 13,000 for constructing the pipeline and 7,000 to manufacture steel pipes and other equipment. It predicts it will take two years to complete.

But TransCanada’s estimate does not mean they expect 20,000 people to work on the project, a spokesman told us.

The spokesman provided little clarification. Fortunately, a Washington Post interview with TransCanada’s chief executive and an email interview with the economist who helped produce the company’s job creation estimates shed some light on the figure.

Each ""job"" represents one ""job year"" or one job lasting for one year, they said.  

This means that if a single person works on the project for both years, his or her stint is counted as two ""jobs.""

This could place the number of actual people employed by the pipeline closer to 10,000, or some 6,500 workers in construction and 3,500 in manufacturing. Not 20,000.

These construction jobs are not permanent, and for the most part, they aren’t local. The positions will disappear when the pipeline is complete. The U.S. Department of State, which is in charge of evaluating the project, estimates that only 10 to 15 percent of these jobs can be filled with workers from communities in the pipeline’s path.

News accounts and independent analyses have explored other shortcomings of TransCanada’s figures. A study released September 2011 by Cornell University’s Global Labor Institute determined that the 20,000 jobs figure is ""not substantiated.""  

About 50 percent of the pipe will come from an Arkansas plant owned by Welspun, a company based in India, according to a press release issued by TransCanada. The rest will come from Canada, Italy and India.

In 2009, company officials said that for an earlier phase of the pipeline, it imported bare pipe manufactured overseas. It’s not clear how much finish work the pipe will need once it arrives in the U.S.

We asked TransCanada whether its manufacturing jobs estimates might include foreign workers, but a spokesman did not provide a response.

Other analyses have called into question TransCanada’s jobs figure. A December 2011 report by Bloomberg said the company's estimate that the project would need six or seven construction workers for every mile of the pipeline is higher than the four to five worker average for earlier phases.

An August 2011 estimate published by the State Department said that the project will employ ""approximately 5,000 to 6,000 workers"" in construction jobs.

An independent analysis of TransCanada’s jobs estimates also produced lower numbers.

Using Cornell’s research, William Wade, president of a consulting economics firm, found that the pipeline would create an average of about 16,100 jobs for each of the two years of construction, or 32,200 ""job years.""

Wade’s figure includes more than the jobs for those who build the pipeline. People such as factory workers and checkout clerks also get jobs when project funds are spent on construction materials and wages.

If Keystone were to create 20,000 job years worth of work in construction alone, then those jobs combined with spinoffs should be much higher than 32,200 job years, Wade said.

""The 20,000 jobs number seems like a mistake. It seems like an overestimate,"" Wade said.

Our ruling:

Isakson said that Keystone ""would employ 20,000 people in the United States."" While any construction project creates jobs, the number Isakson uses seems misleadingly high.

Those 20,000 don’t represent actual people, but one job lasting for one year of a two-year project. The number of construction and manufacturing workers may be closer to 10,000, if you accept TransCanada’s estimate.

And there’s strong evidence from credible sources that it may be lower. Finally, it’s an open question how many of the jobs would be in America",False,"April 11, 2012"
Says Mitt Romney supports cap and trade.,"Here’s the visual: Mitt Romney is armed and tearing through an empty warehouse, firing on his target, Rick Santorum.

It's not the real Mitt Romney; it's a look-alike. Santorum is a cardboard cutout, and the ammo in the gun is mud.

The Santorum campaign ad, ""Rombo,"" is airing in Michigan ahead of the state’s presidential primary. Its message: Romney is attacking his rivals to mask his own record.

""Romney and his super PAC have spent a staggering $20 million brutally attacking fellow Republicans. Why? Because Romney’s trying to hide from his big government Romneycare and his support for job-killing cap and trade.""

Here, we’re testing the claim that Romney supports cap-and-trade legislation to fight pollution.

About cap and trade

Cap and trade seeks to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and other greenhouse gas sources by setting caps on the amount of pollutants a plant can spew into the air. Companies that come in below their caps are allowed to sell emission credits to other companies that need them.

Republicans at one time praised cap and trade as a market-based environmental solution, but recently conservatives have taken to condemning it as an energy tax. Nowadays, you won’t hear Republican presidential candidates say anything but ""no"" to whether they favor it.

They’re so eager to declare their opposition, the candidates at times have fudged their own records on the subject.

Where Romney stands

We didn’t hear back from the Santorum campaign when we asked for backup for this claim. Romney’s campaign sent us several of his past statements on cap and trade.

In August 2011, speaking at a town hall in Lebanon, N.H., Romney emphasized the need for energy independence.

""My focus as it comes to this topic is to get us off of our dependence on foreign oil, to use our natural gas, to drill for our oil, to use our coal, clean coal, to develop nuclear power, to use solar and wind and efficiency measures, that’s my priority. There are other people who would like to put in place a cap-and-trade program and dramatically increase the cost of energy. That’s their view. And by the way, that would kill a lot of jobs. And I don’t think it’s going to solve the problem of global warming.""

In October 2011, speaking at the Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh, Romney was asked directly whether he favors it.

Here’s a portion of his answer: ""I do not believe in a cap-and-trade program. By the way, they do not call it America warming, they call it global warming. So the idea of America spending massive amounts, trillions of dollars to somehow stop global warming is not a great idea. It loses jobs for Americans, and ultimately it won’t be successful, because industries that are energy-intensive will just get up and go somewhere else. So it doesn’t make any sense at all. My view is that we don’t know what’s causing climate change on this planet. And the idea of spending trillions and trillions of dollars to try to reduce CO2 emissions is not the right course for us.""

That’s a slight change from some of his earlier statements about global warming, where he said he believes climate change is, at least in part, caused by human activity.

""I believe that climate change is occurring – the reduction in the size of global ice caps is hard to ignore. I also believe that human activity is a contributing factor. I am uncertain how much of the warming, however, is attributable to man and how much is attributable to factors out of our control,"" Romney wrote in his 2010 book No Apology.

Going back further, when Romney was governor of Massachusetts, he considered joining a regional cap-and-trade compact known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. But when it came time to sign the deal, Romney backed out citing ""a lack of economic safeguards,"" according to POLITICO.

We think that’s good evidence that Romney once held at least cautious support for cap and trade. But the Massachusetts episode also shows that he withdrew his support when the policy was tested against economic considerations.

Our ruling

Santorum’s ad says a machine-gun wielding Romney is firing mud to hide his own support of ""job-killing cap and trade.""

While Romney appears to have favored cap and trade in the past, his actions as governor better prove his skepticism of the policy than his support for it. When he could have signed it into law, he declined. And more recently, Romney has repeatedly said he’s opposed to it. And when asked for evidence of Romney's support for cap and trade, the Santorum campaign failed to produce any. We rate the claim False. UPDATE, Feb. 22, 2012 After we published this story, a reader pointed us to an air pollution plan Romney proposed that was specific to Massachusetts power plants. It was separate from the regional compact that we noted in the original item. The state proposal set emissions limits on power plants and included a ""safety valve"" feature which allowed the companies to buy emission offsets from environmental programs rather than make the reductions in their own facilities. ""You could reduce your emissions or pay into some alternative compliance fund,"" said Billy Pizer, a Duke University professor who helped develop the plan. ""He (Romney) was looking for mechanisms that would still serve the goals of the program but would limit the financial exposure of the regulated firms.""

To Pizer, these carbon limits don’t fit the definition of cap and trade. ""Maybe you’d call it the same family, but it’s different because you’re telling each source, ‘here’s what your limit is, but you can buy reductions from these other programs.’ This idea of trying to limit businesses’ exposure from compliance costs is not a feature of cap and trade.""

We also talked to Fred Bayles, a former reporter for the Associated Press and USA Today who covered Romney’s administration. He now teaches at Boston University. In Bayles’ opinion, the Massachusetts pollution regulations ""fit the broad definition of cap and trade."" But he added, ""it’s in the eye of the beholder.""

We think the emission limits Romney put in place might still raise the hackles of Santorum and other critics of cap and trade. But his program lacked the feature most commonly associated with cap and trade -- namely, an allowance for companies that come in below their emission caps to sell credits to other polluters.

The new information adds some helpful details about Romney's position in the past. It is consistent with what we said in our original story, above, that Romney had expressed some support for cap and trade but backed away from it when he declined to sign on to a regional cap and trade pact",False,"February 16, 2012"
"""When I was fighting against cap and trade, the speaker was sitting down with Nancy Pelosi on a sofa encouraging it.""","Mitt Romney fought back against surging rival Newt Gingrich, fresh off a South Carolina primary win, during the Jan. 23 debate in Tampa. To emphasize his credibility as a conservative leader, Romney brought up how Gingrich resigned as speaker of the House ""in disgrace,"" and that he's been ""working as an influence peddler in Washington"" in the years since. And another thing...

""When I was fighting against cap and trade, the speaker was sitting down with Nancy Pelosi on a sofa encouraging it,"" Romney said.

Ouch. If you're a GOP presidential contender, it'd be hard to think of a more toxic couch-fellow than Pelosi, the leader of the Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives and a former speaker herself.

But the bipartisan canoodling happened.

We know because we've examined this line in some form twice this campaign season. It's been used by super PACs supporting Romney and departed candidate Texas Gov. Rick Perry.

Back in 2008 in a television ad, Pelosi and Gingrich sat on a couch and had a smiley chat about climate change:

""We don’t always see eye to eye, do we, Newt?"" Pelosi says.

""No,"" Gingrich answers, ""but we do agree: Our country must take action to address climate change.""

Pelosi: ""We need cleaner forms of energy, and we need them fast.""

Gingrich: ""If enough of us demand action from our leaders, we can spark the innovation we need.""

The ad directs viewers to the website WeCanSolveIt.org, with the final words from Pelosi, ""Together, we can do this.""

The commercial was created by a climate-change awareness organization now known as the Climate Reality Project, which former vice president Al Gore founded. (WeCanSolveIt.org is the old name of the site now called ClimateRealityProject.org.)

Gingrich and Pelosi were asked to do the bit as part of a larger campaign featuring unlikely pairs who can agree on the need to act on climate change, Gore said in an interview with The Young Turks, an online news show, in December 2011.

Gingrich has since renounced the collaboration, saying in a Fox News interview in November that it was ""probably the dumbest single thing I've ever done."" A section of his website called ""Answering the Attacks"" says, ""Newt absolutely opposes 'cap and trade' as well as any system of taxing carbon emissions.""

What is cap and trade? The idea is that the government sets a limit (the cap) on how much carbon different companies can emit. The government then issues permits to businesses - typically electric utilities and manufacturers - and allows them to buy and sell the permits as needed (the trade). If the policy works as planned, overall emissions decline, companies determine for themselves the best way to lower emissions, and the free market rewards those that lower emissions most effectively.

The Gingrich and Pelosi ad didn't specifically mention cap and trade, but our previous research has shown Gingrich supported cap and trade as recently as 2007. Romney said that Gingrich was sitting on the couch encouraging cap and trade, but Gingrich didn't specifically mention the policy in that ad.

This brings us to the second part of the claim, that while Gingrich was couch sitting, Romney was ""fighting against cap and trade.""

Like Gingrich, Romney has changed his public statements on cap and trade. As Massachusetts governor in 2003, Romney joined in support of a compact among several northeastern states to reduce carbon emissions from power plants. In a letter to then-New York Gov. George Pataki, he said, ""I concur that climate change is beginning to affect our natural resources and that now is the time to take action toward climate protection."" The Economist named him a ""Climate-Friendly"" Republican in 2004.

But in 2005, the same day he announced he would not seek re-election, Romney abruptly pulled out of the regional cap-and-trade agreement. He told the New York Times the pact did not protect businesses and consumers from increased energy costs. Environmental advocates fumed.

Let's recap: Gingrich certainly appeared in a 2008 video with Pelosi and said ""we must take action to address climate change."" He didn't specifically promote cap and trade, though he had supported it in the past. It's also true that Romney rejected what was hailed as a landmark regional cap-and-trade agreement among several northeastern states in 2005 -- although it came after two years of him touting its merit. Both facets of Romney's claim are factual, though they did not occur simultaneously, as his use ""while"" would suggest. They actually were three years apart",Half True,"January 24, 2012"
The proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline is a bipartisan proposal.,"The major party candidates in the 1st Congressional District are on opposite sides of whether President Barack Obama should approve the building of a massive oil pipeline project from Canada to Texas.

Democrat Suzanne Bonamici is opposed; she worries about the environmental impact. Republican Rob Cornilles is supportive; he said in last week’s televised debate, about halfway throughthe program, that the project has bipartisan support.

""I do support the Keystone Pipeline. It’s a bipartisan proposal. Democrats and Republicans alike in Congress want this to move forward, because it’s not only a job creator, it’s also a way for us to responsibly manage how that oil is transferred from Canada to Mexico.

Does the pipeline have bipartisan support?

Much of the really vocal support for this project comes from Republicans. Democrats, not so much, although there are some who want the project. Environmentalists are opposed while labor’s AFL-CIO has decided not to take a formal position.

Senate Democrats who like the project are Max Baucus D-Mont., Jon Tester D-Mont., Mary Landrieu D-La., Mark Pryor, D-Ark., and Mark Begich, D-Alaska, Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and Kent Conrad, D-N.D.  

We queried our delegation. Sens. Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley are opposed. Rep. Earl Blumenauer was among 32 House Democrats who sent a letter urging the State Department
to reject the route. Schrader is opposed to the expedited process, but not necessarily against — or for — the project.

"""[Renewable energy] projects . . . get us off foreign oil and away, step by step, from these foreign entanglements that we have to get into to defend our oil supply.""","The environmental benefits of renewable energy are pretty clear, but the economics can still be muddy. Installing wind turbines and solar panels is expensive. That’s why grants, low-interest loans and tax credits are so important to the industry.

A key federal incentive came up for debate Dec. 13 on the floor of the U.S. Senate.  At issue was the future of the 1603 Treasury grant program, which was created as part of the Obama administration’s stimulus package in 2009. The program offered grants equal to 30 percent of a renewable energy project’s cost.

In what would ultimately be an unsuccessful fight to extend the grant program into 2012, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, spoke up at the hearing. In prepared remarks, he said the program is vital to the industry and that its termination would threaten jobs and projects.

""Let me just bring it home,"" Whitehouse said, as he referred to his notes. ""In Rhode Island, this [grant program] has facilitated solar panel installations on three new bank branches. The TD Bank has opened up in Barrington, in East Providence and in Johnston, Rhode Island. Those projects created jobs, they put people to work, they lowered the cost for these banks of their electrical energy, and they get us off foreign oil and away, step by step, from these foreign entanglements that we have to get into to defend our oil supply.""

That’s a lot of potential benefits from TD Bank’s projects, but we’re interested in just one of them -- that the development of solar power and other forms of renewable energy will, in the senator’s words, ""get us off foreign oil.""

PolitiFact Rhode Island assessed a similar claim last March after state Rep. Jon Brien said that a proposed waste-to-energy plant in Woonsocket was needed because ""residents are paying through the nose for electricity fueled by foreign oil."" We ruled the statement Pants on Fire because New England -- and, in fact, the nation as a whole -- gets only a tiny fraction of its electricity from oil-fired power plants.

We thought we should revisit the issue, however, because it’s a claim that comes up frequently in support of renewable energy. Whitehouse takes it a step further by framing the issue in terms of national security.

The foundation of the claim is the presumption that the United States uses oil to generate its electricity.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a government agency under the Department of Energy, in 2010, petroleum was used to generate less than 1 percent of the country’s power. More than two thirds of the electricity in the United States came from burning coal and natural gas, with much of the balance from nuclear energy and hydroelectric power. Oil is seldom used because its cost has risen so high.

As for Rhode Island, the state is part of the New England power grid in which electricity flows across state lines. In 2010, 0.4 percent of New England’s power was fueled by oil, according to a chart provided by ISO-New England, the nonprofit that manages the grid.

Natural gas plants provided the most power with a share of 32 percent, followed by nuclear stations (29 percent), dual-fuel plants that can burn natural gas and oil (12 percent), coal plants (11 percent), hydropower facilities (6 percent), other renewable energy sources (6 percent) and imported energy from New York and Canada (4 percent).

There are plants in New England that use oil. For example, one of Brayton Point Power Station’s units burns oil, generating 28 percent of the facility’s output, according to a spokesman for Dominion Generation.

But other oil-burning plants don’t operate as much these days -- in fact, many go on line only when demand is highest, say, on hot summer days when air conditioners are turned up -- because oil is so expensive and natural gas, especially, is so cheap.

In Rhode Island, of the nine significant power plants in the state, only three can use oil as well as natural gas, according to Thomas Kogut, spokesman for the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers. The rest exclusively use natural gas.

The only plant that relies entirely on oil is on Block Island and serves only about 1,000 people for most of the year. Only a fraction of 1 percent of the state’s electric generation came from oil in 2010.

But there is something else. After asking for an explanation of Whitehouse’s comments, his office did point out one way that renewable energy would lessen oil usage. Seth Larson, spokesman for the senator, referred to the New England power grid and what happens on peak demand days in the summer.

On those days, usage spikes, going from a typical load of, say, 18,000 megawatts, to 25,000 megawatts or more. In order to meet demand, oil-fired plants kick on.

Despite the high costs, these power plants come on line because there’s no alternative source of power. Larson said that if more renewable energy is developed it will reduce the need to use oil when the grid is stretched.

ISO-New England confirmed that oil is used more on days when demand for power is high. For example, on July 22, 2011, the second-highest demand day ever in the region, oil provided 14 percent of the grid’s power, according to a spokeswoman for ISO-New England. But days like that are isolated and the amount of oil used doesn’t add up to much relative to annual totals.

We also checked with Seth Kaplan, vice president of policy and climate advocacy at the Conservation Law Foundation, a regional environmental advocacy group. He said that renewable energy can make a real difference when demand for power spikes. And peak demand days, he said, typically occur on sunny days when solar power systems perform best.

Kaplan also said that there is a larger point to be made in reference to Whitehouse’s comments. Reducing the country’s reliance on oil is a process. If more sources of renewable energy come on line and if those sources are used to power electric and hybrid vehicles, then demand for oil could drop significantly. That’s because the bulk of the oil used in the United States -- 72 percent, according to the Energy Information Administration -- goes to fueling cars, trucks and planes.

Before we make our ruling, there are other issues with Whitehouse’s comments about the importance of the 1603 grant program that need to be pointed out. Along with TD Bank’s solar power systems, he cites three other projects in Rhode Island that were helped by the grants: a wind turbine at Hodges Badge Company in Portsmouth, a proposed solar farm in East Providence and three wind turbines that are set to go up at the Narragansett Bay Commission in Providence.

There are problems with some of his examples and details that need to be clarified with others.

TD Bank did indeed benefit from Treasury grants, but a spokesman for the company said the projects would have been done with or without federal assistance. In other words, the grants were not crucial to their development.

In his remarks, Whitehouse said that Hodges Badge ""has just gone completely green energy."" At the time, however, the company’s turbine had not been installed. It wasn’t put up until Jan. 4. Hodges Badge has been approved for a Treasury grant but has yet to receive the money, said Rick Hodges, president of the company.

The Narragansett Bay Commission has started construction on three wind turbines at its Fields Point facility on the Providence waterfront, but the project is receiving no money whatsoever from the Treasury program. Because it’s a quasi-public agency, it would never have qualified for the grants, said Jamie Samons, spokeswoman for the commission.

The solar farm being planned in East Providence did not receive a Treasury grant because not enough work was done on the project before the program expired. Jeanne Boyle, director of city planning, said East Providence could have qualified for a grant because it has partnered in the project with a private developer. Despite the termination of the 1603 program, the project is still in the works.

Our ruling

Whitehouse said on the Senate floor that renewable energy projects would ""get us off foreign oil"" and away from ""foreign entanglements that we have to get into to defend our oil supply.""

His comments demand further explanation.

Oil-powered plants provide a tiny amount of the power used in Rhode Island. That’s also true for New England. And the United States as a whole. For the most part, these plants only come on line when demand is highest a few times a year.

But a layperson would assume something different from the senator’s statement -- that oil is a large part of our generating supply and that alternative energy projects would substantially reduce oil consumption.

The truth is investments in solar and wind power, such as the projects the senator cites, won’t have a large effect on oil consumption",Mostly False,"January 8, 2012"
Says Newt Gingrich aligned with Nancy Pelosi on global warming.,"In a video ad, a super PAC promoting Gov. Rick Perry's presidential candidacy attacks two Perry rivals for the Republican nomination, Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney, suggesting that their records prove they are not conservatives. In the style of an old newsreel, the ad from Make Us Great Again, which was formed this year by Austin lobbyist Mike Toomey, a longtime Perry ally, highlights several criticisms that have been lobbed at the former U.S. House speaker and former Massachusetts governor. Among the charges the ad aims at Gingrich is that he joined U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., ""in support of global warming."" We take the wording to mean that Gingrich aligned with Pelosi on the issue of global warming, a pairing that has drawn renewed attention lately. A similar claim is also being heard in a television ad placed in Florida and Iowa this month by another super PAC, Restore Our Future, which is staffed and funded by supporters of Mitt Romney.

It goes after the former House speaker on several issues. Here, we’re focusing on the claim that Gingrich ""teamed with Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore on global warming.""

It was part of a larger campaign featuring ""'unlikely pairs,' who disagree on many issues but appear together to help thwart climate change,"" according to a 2008 story in the San Francisco Chronicle.

What they’re saying now

Gingrich, now tied for the lead for the Republican nomination, has big regrets that he made the ad.

The Gingrich campaign directed us to a section of its website devoted to ""answering the attacks."" In the climate change section, Gingrich is quoted as telling Fox News’ Brett Baier that making the ad with Pelosi was ""probably the dumbest single thing I’ve ever done.""

It goes on to explain that Gingrich opposes cap and trade legislation (although PolitiFact has found he supported it in the past), and he favors increased domestic oil drilling.

In the online news interview, Gore lamented Gingrich’s change of heart.

""I appreciated him agreeing to my request that he do it and I don’t want to be ungracious now. I’m grateful that he did it, and I’m sorry that he’s changed his position,"" Gore said.

"""I never favored cap and trade.""","Three years ago, Newt Gingrich went on television, cozied up to Nancy Pelosi and preached the need to respond to global warming. ""We do agree our country must take action to address climate change,"" Gingrich said from a couch, which was oddly positioned in front of the U.S. Capitol. What seemed like genuine, bipartisan PR in 2008 now looks like conservative heresy by the current frontrunner in the Republican presidential race. Gingrich now calls that TV ad the ""dumbest single thing"" he’s ever done and insists his policy stance on the environment passes all conservative muster. ""If you notice, I never favored cap and trade,"" he said in a candidate forum in New York City on Dec. 3, 2011. Really? Never? We did a little digging and it didn't take long to find that Gingrich has been inconsistent and has at times advocated cap and trade legislation when combined with other approaches. Origins of cap and trade Cap and trade legislation seeks to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and other greenhouse gas sources by setting caps on the amount of pollutants a plant can spew into the air. Companies that come in below their cap are then allowed to sell their emission credits to other companies that need them. Supporters say the approach provides economic incentives to reduce pollution and innovate. Critics deride it as an energy tax and say it increases costs for everyone. The approach was originally employed to curb the pollutants that cause acid rain in the early 1990s. President George H.W. Bush championed it, with the support of both Democrats and Republicans in Congress -- including, yes, Newt Gingrich. The idea was to provide incentives to reduce acid rain through a marketplace approach. As scientists found more evidence of climate change, cap and trade became a popular solution. ""It embodied freedom from the command and control regulation that can be so confining. It was seen as a real step in the right direction for that reason by a lot of Republicans,"" said Eric Pooley, a former journalist and author of the 2010 book The Climate War who is now a senior vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund. In 2008, it was one of the few areas of common ground for Barack Obama and John McCain. Both acknowledged climate change and favored carbon caps. But then several factors combined to change the dynamic, Pooley said. The recession made it hard to talk about any solution that had a price tag attached, and Republicans dug in against Obama's main initiatives. Plus, Pooley said, the rise of the tea party movement put pressure on moderate Republicans, especially those in the House who voted in favor of a cap and trade bill in 2009 that demanded major emissions cuts. The bill died in the Senate. Today, most Republicans in Congress are staunchly against cap and trade. Gingrich praises cap and trade  But contrary to his claim this week, Gingrich has not been consistent on the issue. Four years ago, he was singing the praises of cap and trade -- as long as tax incentives were included in new laws. On Feb. 15, 2007, Gingrich went on the PBS show Frontline and championed cap and trade. Asked if he supported George W. Bush’s campaign pledge in 2000 to set mandatory carbon caps, Gingrich responded: ""I think if you have mandatory carbon caps combined with a trading system, much like we did with sulfur, and if you have a tax-incentive program for investing in the solutions, that there's a package there that's very, very good. And frankly, it's something I would strongly support."" he said. He then went on to criticize Bush for backing off the pledge. ""If he had instituted a regime that combined three things I just said -- mandatory caps, a trading system inside the caps, as we have with clean air, and a tax incentive to be able to invest in the new technology and to be able to produce the new technology -- I think we would be much better off than we are in the current situation,"" Gingrich said. Two months later, Gingrich took part in a debate with Democratic Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts about environmental matters. Gingrich was slightly less gung-ho about cap and trade than he had been on PBS, but his message of ""urgent need for action"" on environmental dangers was clear. ""We should address it and we should address it very actively,"" he said in the debate, citing a UN report documenting the earth’s rising temperatures. ""The … consensus is that humans have contributed to that. I don't think there's any consensus that we are the only contribution, but there is a clear agreement that human activity has helped increase the level of warmness."" On cap and trade, Gingrich said he doubted whether the approach would be as effective with carbon dioxide emissions as it had been with sulfur pollution, which in his view is easier to measure. ""And cap-and-trade, by the way, for sulfuric acid and acid rain -- which I voted for and helped pass as the Republican whip -- was a very definable number of plants. A carbon cap in trade, if it's universal, is enormously complicated and transfers an amazing amount of power to a Washington bureaucracy and will create, inevitably, winners and losers and will become politicized overnight."" He said he favored tax incentives to reduce carbon emissions but added, ""I'm not automatically saying that coercion and bureaucracy isn't an answer. I just don't think it's as positive and as creative an answer as market incentives in terms of getting the kind of change we want."" Then, a bigger shift By 2008, Gingrich was firmly against cap and trade. Pooley called it Gingrich’s ""signature reading of the American political moment."" He started talking not about addressing climate change but about increasing oil drilling domestically. In April of 2009, Gingrich took his cap and trade opposition to a House committee hearing, testifying against the bill that would have set carbon emission caps. Said Gingrich: ""An energy tax punishes senior citizens. It punishes rural Americans. If you use electricity it punishes you; if you use heating oil it punishes you; if you use gasoline it punishes you. This bill will increase your cost of living and may kill your job.""   In that same hearing, however, he left the door open to a law that would apply cap and trade, combined with tax incentives and regulatory changes, to the biggest polluting sites.   ""Now, if you want to write a bill that covers the 2,000 most polluting places and say, fine, those 2,000 are part of cap and trade, I'd be glad to look at it,"" he told the House committee. At the 2011 candidate forum, Gingrich cited this testimony in his opposition to cap and trade. A section of Gingrich’s campaign website devoted to ""setting the record straight"" has this to say on the controversy: Gingrich ""absolutely opposes ‘cap and trade’ as well as any system of taxing carbon emissions"" and on global warming itself and humanity’s responsibility, the website says ""Newt has noted there is no settled scientific conclusion."" Our ruling Gingrich, as a presidential candidate in 2011, declared, ""I never favored cap and trade."" But we found solid evidence he did, with the condition that carbon caps be combined with tax incentives to encourage energy companies to innovate. He told Frontline a cap and trade system combined with tax incentives is ""something I would strongly support,"" and even took a hindsight-is-20/20 stance, saying the country ""would be much better off"" if cap and trade had been instituted. That’s favoring it",False,"December 7, 2011"
Says Mitt Romney has said different things about whether global warming is caused by humans,"Global warming has become a hot potato, at least for Republican presidential candidates.

We’ve seen candidates for the Republican nomination question whether there’s scientific consensus on climate change, but those statements are at odds with the facts. We’ve found the scientific consensus is still firmly on the side of a warming planet. We looked at Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s statement that scientists are ""questioning the original idea that man-made global warming is what is causing the climate to change. … (It is) more and more being put into question."" We rated that False.

The Democratic National Committee recently attacked Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, for flip-flopping on whether he believes climate change was real. (It also accused him of flip-flopping on a number of other issues; see all of our fact-checks of their claims here.)

In a four-minute web ad, the DNC spliced together video of Romney first saying, ""Well, I believe the world is getting warmer … I believe that humans contribute to that.""

And then saying, ""My view is that we don’t know what’s causing climate change on this planet.""

We decided to check into whether Romney has changed his views or not.

Romney’s comments, take 1

Romney’s first comments were from a town hall in New Hampshire in June 2011. A voter asked if he thought climate change existed and was caused by human activity, noting that scientific evidence showed that to be the case.

Here’s part of Romney’s answer (watch the exchange on C-SPAN starting at the 21:00 mark):

""I don't speak for the scientific community, of course. But I believe the world is getting warmer. I can't prove that, but I believe based on what I read that the world is getting warmer. And number two, I believe that humans contribute to that. I don’t know how much our contribution is to that, because I know there have been periods of greater heat and warmth in the past, but I believe that we contribute to that. So I think it's important for us to reduce our emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases that may well be significant contributors to the climate change and the global warming that you're seeing.""

Romney then suggested that the U.S. should reduce its dependence on foreign oil and use more domestically produced natural gas and nuclear energy. And he said some carbon-emitting forms of energy would still have to be used.

Romney also said he opposed the United States unilaterally adopting a cap-and-trade plan if other countries weren’t taking similar steps to reduce greenhouse emissions. For background, a cap-and-trade plan would require industry to pay for their carbon emissions with new permit fees. There would be a limited amount of permits (the ""cap""), but companies would be able to buy and sell the permits among themselves (the ""trade"").

Romney also mentioned that he wrote about energy policy in his book, No Apology. In that book, he wrote, ""I believe that climate change is occurring. The reduction in the size of global ice caps is hard to ignore. I also believe that human activity is a contributing factor.""

He also wrote that cap-and-trade was ""an energy tax, disguised in the sheep’s clothing of market terminology. And it is an energy tax that would have little or no effect on global warming.""

Romney’s comments, take 2

Romney’s second set of comments came at a campaign event in Pittsburgh, Pa., a few months later. His comments were videotaped and posted to a blog called New Hampshire 2012: Green and promoted by Think Progress.

In this case, a voter asked Romney, ""What is your position on man-made global warming and would you reject legislation, such as cap and trade, which is based on the idea of man-made global warming?""

Romney first said he was opposed to cap-and-trade, then said this:

""My view is that we don’t know what’s causing climate change on this planet. And the idea of spending trillions and trillions of dollars to try to reduce CO2 emissions is not the right course for us. My view with regards to energy policy is pretty straightforward. I want us to become energy secure and independent of the oil cartels. And that means let’s aggressively develop our oil, our gas, our coal, our nuclear power.""

Much of Romney’s underlying policy-- reduce foreign oil dependence; increase the use of natural gas and nuclear power; oppose cap-and-trade  -- remained the same in both contexts. In a few cases, he even uses the same phrasing to describe the policies.

But his comments about the cause of global warming did change markedly.

After Romney’s remarks were widely reported, Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul told the Boston Globe that Romney was not flip-flopping: ""This is ridiculous,"" she said in a statement. ""Governor Romney’s view on climate change has not changed. He believes it’s occurring, and that human activity contributes to it, but he doesn’t know to what extent. He opposes cap and trade, and he refused to sign such a plan when he was governor.""

We will be watching to see if Romney is asked again about his thoughts on global warming; we were unable to find any other remarks since then about whether he thought human beings contribute to global warming or not.

Our ruling

In June 2011, Romney said he believed ""the world is getting warmer"" and that ""humans contribute to that."" In October 2011, Romney said that ""we don’t know what’s causing climate change on this planet.""

Interestingly, in spite of his comments on the causes of climate change, Romney outlined the same set of energy policies: in favor of more natural gas and nuclear power; against foreign oil; for the continued use of domestic oil; against a cap-and-trade plan.

Because he didn’t articulate any change of policy, we find Romney’s comments on the causes of climate change perplexing, and we would be interested in hearing him answer pointed questions on the matter. His spokeswoman says the two statements are consistent. But the videos clearly shows that he said different things on the causes of climate change to different audiences, and we believe Romney is savvy enough to know the difference between suggesting a human role in climate change and leaving it out",Mostly True,"November 30, 2011"
Says Texas wildfires are linked to climate change.,"During a Sept. 26, 2011, speech at a Democratic National Committee fundraising event in San Jose, Calif., President Barack Obama aimed some attack lines at the Republican Party.

""Some of you here may be folks who actually used to be Republican but are puzzled by what’s happened to that party...."" Obama said in comments that, according to the White House’s transcript, were punctuated by laughter. ""I mean, has anybody been watching the debates lately? You’ve got a governor whose state is on fire denying climate change. No, no, it’s true. You’ve got audiences cheering at the prospect of somebody dying because they don’t have health care, and booing a service member in Iraq because they’re gay. That’s not reflective of who we are. We’ve had differences in the past, but at some level we’ve always believed, you know what, that we’re not defined by our differences. We’re bound together.""

After several readers brought it to our attention, we zeroed in on Obama’s comment that ""you’ve got a governor whose state is on fire denying climate change.""

The governor in question is Rick Perry of Texas -- one of the leading candidates in the Republican presidential primary and therefore a potential challenger to Obama in his bid for a second term next year.

As for the fires Obama mentioned, Texas has been experiencing one of its most severe wildfire seasons in history.  According to the Texas Forest Service, 3.8 million acres burned and 2,742 homes were destroyed by wildfires between Nov. 15, 2010 and Sept. 26, 2011.

A spokesman for Perry, Mark Miner, thought Obama’s comment was unfair, telling ABC News, ""It’s outrageous President Obama would use … the worst fires in state history as a political attack.""

Asked about Obama’s comments during a Sept. 26 press availability, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters on Air Force One that the president’s ""point was simply that you have severe weather in that state, and the leader of that state questioned whether something that's been well established as a scientific fact is in fact a fact. … (Obama’s) point is that the link between climate and the severe weather that we’ve been experiencing is something that's studied by scientists all the time, and to simply dismiss it is, he believes, not responsible leadership.""

Despite our readers’ urgings, we gave serious thought to not rating Obama’s comment on the Truth-O-Meter. Obama clearly intended it to be a lighthearted comment, and the audience took it that way, as evidenced by applause noted in the transcript. In addition, the line was a rhetorical aside, not part of a substantive policy address about climate change.

But Obama’s comment fit our main qualification for choosing items to fact-check -- would people wonder whether the comment is true? Is it possible to draw a link between a specific weather event, such as the drought in Texas and the wildfires, and global climate change?

As it turns out, this question has an interesting answer.

First, some background on climate change.

Perry is on record expressing skepticism that human actions are causing climate change. During a Republican debate on Sept. 7, 2011, he said that ""the science is not settled (on climate change). The idea that we would put Americans’ economy at jeopardy based on scientific theory that’s not settled yet to me is just nonsense."" We also fact-checked a separate comment by Perry ""questioning the original idea that man-made global warming is what is causing the climate to change. … (It is) more and more being put into question.""

We ruled Perry’s statements False. As we noted, one of the most oft-cited reports on climate change comes from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is widely considered the leading international organization on climate science. It includes the scientific consensus of thousands of researchers from 194 countries. ""Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in (human-created) greenhouse gas concentrations,"" the most recent report states.
   
In the United States, the U.S. Global Change Research Program coordinates and integrates federal research on climate. Its 2009 report mirrored the IPCC's conclusions, and the report directly addressed the question of how climate change could affect weather.

""Water is an issue in every region, but the nature of the potential impacts varies,"" it said in a summary. ""Drought, related to reduced precipitation, increased evaporation and increased water loss from plants, is an important issue in many regions, especially in the West. Floods and water quality problems are likely to be amplified by climate change in most regions. Declines in mountain snowpack are important in the West and Alaska where snowpack provides vital natural water storage.""

However, climate-change experts have also long urged caution in assuming that particular weather events are caused or influenced by climate change.

Consider a June 2011 paper published by the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, an independent research organization. In the paper -- titled ""Extreme Weather and Climate Change Understanding the Link, Managing the Risk"" -- co-authors Daniel G. Huber and Jay Gulledge write that ""when we ask whether climate change ‘caused’ a particular event, we pose a fundamentally unanswerable question."" In fact, they say it is ""nonsense"" to debate a direct climatological link between a single event and the long-term rise in the global average surface temperature.

The reason, Huber and Gulledge write, is the distinction between ""climate"" -- a long-term pattern that averages many weather events over the years -- and a particular weather event.

By definition, Huber and Gulledge write, ""an isolated event lacks useful information about climate trends. Consider a hypothetical example: Prior to any change in the climate, there was one category 5 hurricane per year, but after the climate warmed for some decades, there were two category 5 hurricanes per year. In a given year, which of the two hurricanes was caused by climate change? Since the two events are indistinguishable, this question is nonsense. It is not the occurrence of either of the two events that matters. The two events together – or more accurately, the average of two events per year – define the change in the climate.""

What makes the Texas situation an imperfect fit for this general rule is that what’s happening isn’t one wildfire, or even a spate of wildfires. It’s a months-long season of specific weather-related events -- wildfires -- whose roots stem from broader climatic conditions.

""It is a combination of unprecedented heat this summer, completely obliterating the previous record; exceptional drought conditions; exceptional soil moisture decreases, which exacerbate the temperature extremes; and, on top of that, extensive wild fires,"" said Gavin Schmidt, a climate specialist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. ""These elements cannot be separated. … Extreme heat becomes more common under climate change, and that has consequences, depending on location -- more drought, and more susceptibility to wildfires.""

Even Gulledge, the co-author of the Pew paper that cautioned against blaming weather events on climate change, said the Texas case may constitute an exception to the rule he laid out.

""There is a well-documented link between the earlier start of spring, higher summer temperatures, and drier conditions during summer and fall -- that is, climate change -- and a dramatic increase in wildfire activity in the western U.S. since the late 1980s,"" he said. ""These observations reveal an increase in fire risk due to climate change.""

Gulledge found it noteworthy that in a recent blog post, John Nielsen-Gammon -- the Texas state climatologist and a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University -- suggested a connection between the wildfires and climate change, even if it came with caveats and limitations.

On the one hand, Nielsen-Gammon said the low rainfall levels since October 2010 do not appear to have been made ""more likely"" by global warming. In turn, this rainfall deficit, he estimated, explains most of the excess heat that set the stage for the wildfires. On the other hand, his modeling suggested that global warming did provide an additional contributing factor to the unusually high temperatures. ""The impacts of the drought,"" he concluded, ""were enhanced by global warming.""

What makes this topic so difficult to analyze is that the way the atmosphere works is extremely complicated. Gulledge compared the atmosphere to a car.

""Both the atmosphere and a car are complex systems, but one is fundamentally predictable, while the other is fundamentally unpredictable,"" he said. ""A given force applied to the atmosphere has many different potential outcomes, not a single calculable outcome. That’s different from an automobile, which can be predicted very precisely. If I step on the gas, it will speed up; if I turn the wheel, the car will turn. Consequently, weather forecasters give percentage chances of rain instead of performing a single calculation that predicts a single amount of rain in a given place on a given day.""

A related complication is that this boils down to a question of probabilities rather than certainties.

""The right question to ask is, ‘Has global warming increased the likelihood of an event like the Texas drought occurring’ And the answer to that question is yes,"" said Brian Soden, a professor of meteorology and physical oceanography at the University of Miami. ""While droughts occur in a climate unaffected by human activities, a warming climate increases the likelihood that they will occur.""

He offers an analogy that he credits to a colleague, Tony Broccoli of Rutgers University. ""Consider a baseball player who goes through a rigorous off-season training program, which results in greater strength and faster bat speed,"" Soden said. ""On his first at bat of the season, he hits a home run. Would you say that the home run was a result of his off season training? No one can answer that question. But would you say that the off-season training increased the likelihood of it occurring? Yes.""

Rob Jackson, the director of the Duke Center on Global Change, acknowledges this backdrop of uncertainty. ""Can anyone say with certainty that this is climate-change related? Absolutely not,"" he said. But Jackson -- who went to college and taught in Texas and continues to visit frequently to see family -- suggested that the scale of the Texas wildfires is starting to change the minds of some scientists who have traditionally been hesitant to blame specific weather events on climate change.

""The heat and drought I saw in August is almost enough to make me say that climate change is playing a role, amplifying other factors,"" Jackson said. ""I've never said that before about any weather event.""

Our ruling

Historically, scientists have drawn a clear distinction between specific weather events and longer-range changes in climate, and that sentiment persists. Normally, we would be extremely skeptical of claims linking specific weather events to climate change. However, the situation in Texas that Obama was referring to could be described as something broader than a specific weather event, and there is peer-reviewed evidence linking broader climate change in the American southwest with the incidence of wildfires in the region.

The Texas state climatologist recently wrote that he believes climate change has had an effect in encouraging the current wildfires, but only as a modest contributing factor",Half True,"September 28, 2011"
"Says there’s not ""much evidence to suggest that people have (contributed to global warming) or can do very much to change anything.""","Kevin Coughlin, a former Republican state legislator from Cuyahoga Falls, has been making Ohio’s political rounds this summer in an effort to capture his party’s nod to take on Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown next year.

At an Aug. 18 stop in Strongsville, Coughlin told the Strong Ohio tea party group he believes the science behind global warming is ""sketchy.""

""Scientists who consider themselves to be environmentalists disagree on the science and the impact,"" Coughlin said. ""There is no question that the earth’s core is increasing slightly in temperature.

""But the real question and I think what’s pertinent to the debate in our country and in global politics is how much people really contributed to it and I don’t really think there’s much evidence to suggest that people have or can do very much to change anything.""

That got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention.  

We contacted Coughlin, whose appearance was captured on video by a Democratic super PAC, American Bridge 21st Century. He acknowledged making the remarks, although he said meant to say the Earth’s atmosphere -- not its core -- is rising in temperature.

But do scientists agree with his assertion that there’s not ""much evidence to suggest that people have or can do very much to change anything.""

Many Republican politicians apart from Coughlin assert that scientists disagree whether human actions contribute to global warming.

Before he dropped out of the GOP presidential primary last month, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty told the Miami Herald newspaper ""the science is in dispute"" over ""how much, if any"" climate change can be blamed on human behavior. At an Aug. 17 New Hampshire campaign stop, Texas Gov. Rick Perry said that scientists are regularly ""coming forward and questioning the original idea that man-made global warming is what is causing the climate to change.""

PolitiFact examined these claims by Pawlenty and Perry, and found them to be False. That’s because there does appear to be a scientific consensus that people contribute to global warming.

To begin with, a 2007 report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s leading international scientific body on climate science, states: ""Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations. The observed widespread warming of the atmosphere and ocean, together with ice mass loss, support the conclusion that it is extremely unlikely that global climate change of the past 50 years can be explained without external forcing, and very likely that it is not due to known natural causes alone."" (External forcing refers to anything that changes the climate that is outside of the normal climate system.)

A 2009 report from the U.S. Global Change Research Program reached a similar conclusion: ""Observations show that warming of the climate is unequivocal. The global warming observed over the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases. These emissions come mainly from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), with important contributions from the clearing of forests, agricultural practices, and other activities.""

Current climate change research was reviewed again this year by the National Research Council and the National Academy of Sciences. The committee it assembled concluded that global warming poses significant risks and is happening primarily because of greenhouse gas emissions from human activities. It rejected the idea that those findings are in any way questionable.

""Although the scientific process is always open to new ideas and results, the fundamental causes and consequences of climate change have been established by many years of scientific research, are supported by many different lines of evidence, and have stood firm in the face of careful examination, repeated testing, and the rigorous evaluation of alternative theories and explanations,"" the committee’s report said.

A few scientists dispute the IPCC’s conclusions on global warming, but most acknowledge that humans contribute to increased temperatures. They make more nuanced points, like  questioning whether carbon emissions by themselves are enough to boost temperatures, whether other human activities contribute, whether rising temperatures cause severe weather, and whether public policy change is needed to address potential problems.

Climate change skeptics cite an online petition with more than 31,000 signatures to demonstrate their viewpoint is widespread. The petition states ""there’s no convincing scientific evidence"" that human greenhouse gas releases are disrupting the Earth’s climate, and there’s ""substantial evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects"" on Earth’s plants and animals. That petition has been criticized for not checking the credentials of its signatories or even proving they exist.

But surveys of large numbers of climate researchers show a clear consensus among them that humans are causing climate change.

One 2010 study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that 97 to 98 percent out of 1,372 climate researchers who are publishing scientific studies in the field say they believe that human beings are causing climate change, and that the scientific credentials of researchers who doubt that role are ""substantially below that of the convinced researchers.""

A study published the previous year by the American Geophysical Union, asked more than 3,100 scientists whether they think human activity significantly contributes to ""changing mean global temperatures."" About 82 percent of the surveyed scientists answered ""Yes,"" with a 97.4 percent affirmative rate among climate change specialists.

While a few skeptics out there disagree, there’s clear scientific consensus that global warming is occurring and that humans contribute to it",False,"August 31, 2011"
"Scientists are ""questioning the original idea that man-made global warming is what is causing the climate to change. … (It is) more and more being put into question.""","Texas Gov. Rick Perry has made it clear he doesn't believe that human beings are contributing to global warming, and he expounded on the issue in detail at a campaign stop in Bedford, N.H.

""I do believe that the issue of global warming has been politicized,"" Perry said. ""I think there are a substantial number of scientists who have manipulated data so that they will have dollars rolling into their projects. I think we're seeing it almost weekly or even daily, scientists who are coming forward and questioning the original idea that man-made global warming is what is causing the climate to change.""

He added that plans to address climate change by limiting carbon emissions would cost ""billions, if not trillions"" and that America should not spend that much money on ""scientific theory that has not been proven and from my perspective is more and more being put into question.""

Perry is the latest candidate to enter the race for the Republican nomination for president, announcing on Aug. 13, 2011, that he is running. Perry has served as the Texas governor since 2000.

So is Perry correct? Is there significant disagreement on the causes of global warming?

We looked at this question in some detail in a previous fact-check on candidate Tim Pawlenty, who has since dropped out of the race. Pawlenty said, ""The weight of the evidence is that most of it, maybe all of it, is because of natural causes ... it's fair to say the science is in dispute."" We rated that statement False. This report reviews much of the same evidence.

We'll start with the basics.

One of the most oft-cited reports is from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a scientific body considered the leading international organization on climate science. It includes the scientific consensus of thousands of researchers from 194 countries.

""Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations,"" the most recent report states. ""The observed widespread warming of the atmosphere and ocean, together with ice mass loss, support the conclusion that it is extremely unlikely that global climate change of the past 50 years can be explained without external forcing, and very likely that it is not due to known natural causes alone."" (External forcing refers to anything outside of the normal climate system that changes the climate, including the results of human activity, sunspots or volcanic eruptions.)

In the United States, the U.S. Global Change Research Program coordinates and integrates federal research on climate. Its 2009 report mirrored the IPCC's conclusions: ""Observations show that warming of the climate is unequivocal. The global warming observed over the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases. These emissions come mainly from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), with important contributions from the clearing of forests, agricultural practices, and other activities.""

Earlier this year, a committee organized by the National Research Council and the National Academy of Sciences again reviewed the current research on climate change. The committee concluded that climate change is occurring, that it is caused primarily by the emission of greenhouse gases from human activities, and that it poses significant risks for a range of human and natural systems. It specifically rejected the view that that those findings are in some way questionable.

""Although the scientific process is always open to new ideas and results, the fundamental causes and consequences of climate change have been established by many years of scientific research, are supported by many different lines of evidence, and have stood firm in the face of careful examination, repeated testing, and the rigorous evaluation of alternative theories and explanations,"" the committee said.

We asked the Perry campaign for comment on this, but we didn't hear back. In response to similar questions from the Washington Post, the Perry campaign pointed to various writings questioning climate change. But the Post's report noted these writings were anecdotal and ""not evidence of the groundswell of opposition suggested by Perry."" We concur.

To be clear, we're not saying that no scientists -- as in zero -- dispute climate change is caused by human activity.  We looked into the work of the most prominent and best credentialed people who have questioned the IPCC's conclusions on global warming. Generally speaking, even these scientists do not claim that humans are making no contribution at all to rising temperatures. Rather, they tend to make more nuanced points. They question whether carbon emissions alone are driving up temperatures, or whether other human activities contribute as well. They question whether extreme weather events such as storms or floods can be conclusively linked to rising temperatures. And, they question whether significant changes to public policy are necessary as a means of coping with rising temperatures.

Climate change skeptics also have their own petition, commonly called the Oregon petition, that has been endorsed by 31,000 signers opposing restrictions on carbon emissions. But that petition has been criticized for not checking the credentials of its signatories or even proving that all the signatories exist.

Several scientific studies have attempted to quantify just how much agreement there is among scientists when it comes to climate change.

A 2010 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences -- the official publication of the United States National Academy of Sciences -- found that out of 1,372 climate researchers under review, approximately 97 to 98 percent of those actively publishing in the field said they believe human beings are causing climate change, which they term anthropogenic (i.e., man-made) climate change. It also concluded that ""the relative climate expertise and scientiﬁc prominence"" of the researchers unconvinced of man-made climate change are ""substantially below that of the convinced researchers.""

An earlier survey published in the 2009 issue of Eos -- a publication of the American Geophysical Union -- asked scientists from a wide range of disciplines (approximately 3,146): ""Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?"" Approximately 82 percent of the surveyed scientists answered yes to this question. Of those climate change specialists surveyed, 97.4 percent answered yes.

Perry also charged that scientists have been manipulating data. He could be referring to a 2009 incident when stolen e-mails from the Climatic Research United at the University of East Anglia were released on the Internet. Global warming skeptics said the e-mails showed climate researchers were manipulating data.

But several inquiries debunked those allegations, including investigations by the British Parliament, the U.S. Department of Commerce, Pennsylvania State University and the InterAcademy Council. The inquiries found that, while the scientists had made rude remarks about people who questioned climate change, they were not falsifying data. Some of the investigations recommended greater transparency and sharing of climatic data, but the independent investigations exonerated the researchers of falsifying data.

Perry's remarks give the impression that the science of global warming is in dispute, that some scientists feel one way, and some scientists feel another way. He says that skepticism is growing. In fact, our research shows that's not the case. We found that there is solid consensus among the major scientific organizations and that the skeptics seems to be small minority",False,"August 22, 2011"
"""The weight of the evidence (on global warming) is that most of it, maybe all of it, is because of natural causes ... it’s fair to say the science is in dispute.""","Climate change has become a touchy subject in the Republican primary. Though some candidates once supported plans to reduce carbon emissions, such strategies have fallen out of favor with Republicans in recent years. Even acknowledging that human beings are causing climate change can be politically problematic for some Republicans. Our colleagues at the Miami Herald asked Republican presidential candidate and former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty about his views on climate change in an interview on Aug. 3, 2011. His response piqued our interest:

""Well, there’s definitely climate change. The more interesting question is how much is a result of natural causes and how much, if any, is attributable to human behavior. And that’s what the scientific dispute is about,"" said Pawlenty. ""It’s something we have to look to the science on. The weight of the evidence is that most of it, maybe all of it, is because of natural causes... There’s lots of layers to it. But at least as to any potential man-made contribution to it, it’s fair to say the science is in dispute.""

We divided Pawlenty’s answer into his two essential claims:  

  • Evidence points toward climate change being primarily a natural, rather than man-made, phenomenon.

  • The science about the causes of global climate change is in dispute.

To check the first claim, we turned to the most recent report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a scientific body considered the leading international organization on climate science. ""Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations,"" the 2007 report states. ""The observed widespread warming of the atmosphere and ocean, together with ice mass loss, support the conclusion that it is extremely unlikely that global climate change of the past 50 years can be explained without external forcing, and very likely that it is not due to known natural causes alone."" (External forcing refers to anything that changes the climate that is outside of the normal climate system.)

In the United States, the U.S. Global Change Research Program coordinates and integrates federal research on climate. Its 2009 report mirrored the IPCC’s conclusions: ""Observations show that warming of the climate is unequivocal. The global warming observed over the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases. These emissions come mainly from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), with important contributions from the clearing of forests, agricultural practices, and other activities.""

The IPCC report states that the period from 1995 to 2006 contains 11 of the 12 warmest years on record since instrumental measurement began in 1850. It concluded that global surface temperature rose 0.76 degrees Celsius from the end of the 19th century (1850-1899) to the beginning of the 21st (2001-2005).  The U.S. Global Change Research Program’s report similarly found that the average global temperature increase by 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since 1900.

While these temperature changes may sound small, keep in mind that these are averages. The rise in temperature, and its visible effects, are more pronounced in certain parts of the world than in others. The polar ice sheets are particularly vulnerable to temperature increases. Greenland lost 36 to 60 cubic miles of ice from 2002 to 2006 while Antarctica lost 36 cubic miles of ice during roughly the same time period.

Brian Soden, a professor of meteorology and physical oceanography at the University of Miami, was one of the many scientific contributors to the 2007 IPCC report.

""The rise in global mean temperature since the 19th century may seem small, and projections of global mean warming over the next century range from 2 to 5 degrees Celsius,"" Soden said. ""One way to put these numbers into perspective is to realize that the current climate is now only about 5 degrees Celsius warmer than it was during the last ‘glacial maximum’ (approximately 20,000 years ago) when ice covered much of North America extending all the way down to St Louis.""

If you’ve been following the debate recently, you may remember that climate research on temperature was called into question in 2009 when stolen e-mails from the Climatic Research United at the University of East Anglia were released on the Internet. Global warming skeptics said the e-mails showed climate researchers were manipulating data.

But several inquiries debunked those allegations, including those conducted by the British Parliament, the U.S. Department of Commerce, Pennsylvania State University, and the InterAcademy Council. The inquiries found that while the scientists had made rude remarks about people who questioned climate change, they were not falsifying data. A few reports recommended greater transparency and sharing of climatic data, but the independent investigations exonerated the researchers of falsifying data.

They question whether extreme weather events such as storms or floods can be conclusively linked to rising temperatures. And, they question whether significant changes to public policy are necessary as a means of coping with rising temperatures.

For Pawlenty’s second claim -- that there is dispute about the causes of climate change -- we decided to look at the opinions of world scientists about the issue.

Several studies have attempted to quantify how much agreement there is among scientists when it comes to climate change.

A  2010 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences - the official publication of the United States National Academy of Sciences - found that out of 1,372 climate researchers surveyed, approximately 97 to 98 percent of those actively publishing in the field said they believe human beings are causing the climate change, which they term anthropogenic (i.e., man-made) climate change.  It also concluded that ""the relative climate expertise and

Approximately 82 percent of the surveyed scientists answered yes to this question. Of those climate change specialists surveyed, 97.4 percent answered yes to this question.

Climate change skeptics have their own petition, commonly called the Oregon petition, that has been endorsed by 31,000 signers opposing restrictions on carbon emissions. But that petition has been criticized for not checking the credentials of its signatories or proving that the signatories exist.

To be clear, we’re not saying that no scientists dispute man-made climate change. When we contacted the Pawlenty campaign, they pointed us to several published pieces, such as writings by John R. Christy, who was counted as a dissenting researcher as part of the 2010 study from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

But these skeptics seem to be a small -- even tiny -- minority, in contrast to Pawlenty’s comments suggesting significant disagreement. Many of the skeptics agree that climate change is occurring and that human activities play a part. But they disagree with some of the conclusions formulated in mainstream climate science.

To summarize: Based on our research, there is very little dispute in the scientific community, especially among climate specialists, on whether climate change is primarily caused by natural or man-made forces. The overwhelming majority of scientists polled feel that human activity is the primary driver of climate change. Also, based on scientific studies by the IPCC and others, global warming over the past 50 years has been primarily driven by human activity.

Based upon the preponderance of evidence we conclude that Tim Pawlenty’s claims are both incorrect and misleading to the public, who may not be familiar with the science behind climate change.  It is not ""fair to say the science is in dispute,"" as if there are good arguments on both sides. Rather, there is significant scientific consensus that human beings are contributing to global warming",False,"August 14, 2011"
"""One of the reasons that Budweiser stayed in New Jersey is the money they got from RGGI to put solar on their roof to save on their energy costs.""","The ""King of Beers"" has reigned in Newark for more than half a century.

But according to Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club, Anheuser-Busch’s Budweiser brewery may have been seeking a new home.

Soon after Gov. Chris Christie announced plans to pull New Jersey out of a regional cap-and-trade program, lawmakers, state officials, business leaders and environmental leaders debated the merits of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, during a state assembly committee hearing.

In response to testimony that RGGI, known as ""Reggie,"" was one of the reasons businesses were leaving the state, Tittel said, ""When we talk about businesses, and I know this from first hand, one of the reasons that Budweiser stayed in New Jersey is the money they got from RGGI to put solar on their roof to save on their energy costs.""

RGGI caps the amount of carbon dioxide power plants can emit in 10 states. Credits can be bought or sold if plants need to release more or less carbon dioxide. Proceeds from the sales help participating states fund clean energy initiatives.

PolitiFact New Jersey questioned whether the St. Louis-based beer company had ever considered abandoning its throne in the Garden State and if a reduction in energy costs from solar panels funded by RGGI was one of the reasons that convinced them to stay. Neither was true.

First, let’s note that Anheuser-Busch’s Newark brewery had solar panels installed on its roof.

A May 17, 2010 news release issued by Anheuser-Busch announcing the installation said more than 3,000 photovoltaic solar panels, covering 65,000 square feet, would be capable, at peak production, of ""covering nearly five percent of the brewery's electricity demand."" Orion Energy Systems installed and operate the solar panels, according to the release.

Anheuser-Busch officials quoted in the release talked about how the installation is an example of the company’s commitment to alternate energy sources. There is no mention of the solar panel project swaying the company to stay in New Jersey.

So the brewery had solar panels installed on its roof, but did the beer company receive RGGI funds for the project?

Tittel said his statement was based on a conversation he had with Al Komjathy, a lobbyist with the firm Komjathy & Stewart, which represents Anheuser-Busch, among other companies.

But Komjathy said he never spoke with Tittel about the issue. ""I never had that discussion with him,"" he told PolitiFact New Jersey.

And Anheuser-Busch told us in a statement: ""Our Newark brewery did not receive funding from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative for the solar panel project and there were no plans to relocate the brewery.""

It’s worth noting that Anheuser-Busch applied for funding for a cogeneration power plant at its Newark brewery through the Clean Energy Solutions Capital Investment initiative, a financing program funded by RGGI proceeds and controlled by the state Economic Development Authority. Laura Jones, a spokeswoman for the state Economic Development Authority, said the agency approved Anheuser-Busch’s request, but that the beer company never used the funding.

Tittel said at the time he made the claim about the solar panels, ""I thought it was accurate."" Now, he said, ""most of what I said was accurate but not 100 percent.""

Most? Try little to nothing.

The only thing Tittel got correct in his statement is that solar panels were installed on the roof of Anheuser-Busch’s Newark brewery. Funding for the project did not come from RGGI and the company said it was never considering leaving the state.

Tittel tried to argue that although the brewery did not receive funding through RGGI, legislation, often called ""the RGGI law,"" helped the project.

As part of the project, PSEG Power agreed to purchase solar renewable energy certificates produced by the solar panels, according to PSEG spokesman Fran Sullivan.

Tittel said he was referring to Section 13 in ""the RGGI law"" -- the section allows electric and utility companies to charge ratepayers for investments they make in energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.

However, a spokesman for the state Board of Public Utilities  told us that because PSEG Power is not regulated, Section 13 does not apply.

Let’s recap.

Tittel claimed one of the reasons Anheuser-Busch’s Budweiser brewery in Newark stayed in New Jersey is because they received funding through RGGI to install solar panels, thereby reducing their energy costs.

Anheuser-Busch told us they weren’t planning on relocating the brewery and that they did not receive funds through RGGI for the solar project",False,"July 4, 2011"
Says Ocean Spray is moving its Bordentown processing facility to Pennsylvania largely because of costs associated with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.,"Editor's Note: This Truth-O-Meter ruling is the subject of a story found here. Before Gov. Chris Christie announced plans in late May to withdraw from a cap and trade program, Republicans had added a new ingredient to the ongoing debate: cranberries.

In early May, Ocean Spray announced plans to close its Bordentown facility, where the growers' co-op makes beverages, and relocate operations to the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania.

On May 9, Republicans held a news conference and issued a press release to call for an end to the state’s involvement in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Under RGGI -- or ""Reggie"" as it’s called -- energy companies buy allowances to comply with a cap on carbon dioxide emissions.

State Sen. Diane Allen (R-Burlington/Camden) cited Ocean Spray's move as an example of how the RGGI was hurting the state's businesses.

""As a former president and CEO of a small business, I can attest to the impact rising energy rates have on an employer’s ability to add jobs and expand,"" she said in a May 9 news release. ""Just ask Ocean Spray, which last week announced it will be moving its Bordentown processing facility to Pennsylvania, in large measure due to the costs associated with RGGI.""

PolitiFact New Jersey dug into her claim and quickly found it didn't have much juice: Five news articles and two TV segments about Ocean Spray's move didn’t mention any connection between the decision and RGGI.

We checked with Adam Bauer, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans, who said Allen’s comments were based on information she received from longtime cranberry grower Bill Haines Jr. According to Ocean Spray, Haines served on the Ocean Spray board of directors between 1996 and 1999, and then again in 2002.

Haines never called us back, so we asked Ocean Spray.

Company spokesman John Isaf said in an email that higher energy rates factored into the decision to leave Bordentown, but ""not the RGGI program or its contribution to the rate.""

The decision, he said, ""was based on a variety of factors -- lower energy costs, improved transportation and distribution (warehousing/freight) logistics; proximity to supply chain partners and customers; lower labor costs; other utility cost advantages (water/wastewater/gas); and a more efficient and modern infrastructure and facility,"" Isaf said in the statement.

""While energy costs were one of several considerations that went into our decision, and NJ’s costs are significantly higher than other states, we were looking at the total rate paid, not the RGGI program or its contribution to the rate,"" Isaf said.

That's enough for the Truth-O-Meter, but we thought it was also worth exploring the senator's underlying point, that the cap-and-trade portion is driving up electricity costs.

Utility representatives and experts have an answer: not so much.

According to Karen Johnson, spokeswoman for Public Service Electric and Gas, which supplies power to the Bordentown area, the cap-and-trade portion doesn’t affect electricity bills very much for a customer in Ocean Spray’s rate class.

For the average customer in that rate class, the cap-and-trade portion -- meaning the cost of purchasing allowances -- accounts for 0.4 percent of the annual bill, Johnson said.

Judi Greenwald, vice president of Innovative Solutions at the Virginia-based Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said the effects of RGGI on utility costs have been mostly undetectable.

""The rate impacts have been miniscule and probably not even perceptible,"" Greenwald told us.

Across the 10-state region within the RGGI, the emissions cap accounted for between 0.24 and 0.61 percent of average residential electricity bills in 2010, according to a fact sheet prepared by RGGI. That impact represents 46 extra cents per month for a typical household’s electricity usage, according to the RGGI.

In many cases, electricity prices in New Jersey are based on bids submitted by suppliers in non-RGGI states, according to Peter Shattuck, a carbon markets policy analyst for Environment Northeast. For instance, if a supplier in Pennsylvania, which is not part of RGGI, sets the price, New Jersey utilities are not facing RGGI-related charges, he said.

So let’s review:

Allen claimed that Ocean Spray was leaving Bordentown ""in large measure due to the costs associated with RGGI."" Yet Ocean Spray said it did not consider RGGI and its impacts on the energy rate.

On top of that, a PSE&G spokeswoman and energy experts said RGGI has had a minimal impact on utility costs",False,"June 20, 2011"
"Commerce Secretary nominee John Bryson ""appears to endorse world government.""","Supporting climate change policy is one thing, but is Barack Obama’s nominee for commerce secretary, John Bryson, an advocate for world government?

That's the speculation raised by anonymous GOP sources on Capitol Hill, according to the conservative website the Daily Caller.

Bryson, former chief executive officer and chairman of Southern California energy conglomerate Edison International and co-founder of the Natural Resources Defense Council, has been under fire due to his support for clean-energy legislation. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., called him an ""environmental extremist"" and Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., a global warming skeptic, says he fears Bryson would implement climate change policy that would hurt American businesses. Bryson's nomination is also opposed by Massachusetts Democrats, Reps. Barney Frank and John Tierney, because of the NRDC's fight for fishing-catch limits.

But the claim that Bryson supports a ""world government"" raises the rhetoric to a new level.

The speculation originated in a June 7, 2011, story in the Daily Caller that ran under the headline: ""Commerce nominee appears to endorse world government in video, Republicans say.""

Here's how the story begins:
 
Does John Bryson, Barack Obama’s nominee for commerce secretary, want a world government?

Critics say a newly uncovered video of the nominee suggests that he does.

In the video – given to The Daily Caller by sources on Capitol Hill – Bryson refers to the 2009 United Nations climate negotiations in Copenhagen as ""the closest thing we have to a world governance organization,"" implying it provided the best model for imposing climate regulations on countries around the globe.

Bryson also boasts about his role as an adviser to the U.N. secretary general on climate change in the video.

The story includes a link to a 1-minute and 25-second clip of Bryson making a formal presentation to an unidentified group. Here's the fuller context from the attached video:

""I thought that one of the things that is, in my judgment, not as well covered in the press and not as well understood as it ought to be is the kind of global picture on addressing clean energy and climate change. One of the things that have been a particular pleasure for me over the last year is I’ve been working as an adviser to the Secretary General of the United Nations on that subject. So I thought I would talk a little about that, talk a little about Copenhagen, a little bit about the global environmental and energy picture as I see it. Where we are. Where we might go. I thought I’d start there…So, let’s start with Copenhagen. So Copenhagen, obviously the United Nations is the global entity, the closest thing we have to a world governance organization. Copenhagen negotiations take place under the auspices of the United Nations as does the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), the side of the body that’s developed this growing consensus about the effects of carbon emissions, greenhouse gas emissions on climate change.""

That seems like pretty flimsy evidence on which to base speculation that Bryson ""appears to endorse world government."" So we contacted Daily Caller reporter John Rossomando to find out who provided the video and made the claims. Rossomando wrote back that, ""it came from GOP officials on the Hill, of whom I am not a liberty to name.""

We tracked the origin of the video to a presentation Bryson made at an energy symposium hosted by the University of California Berkeley on March 4, 2010. It's actually about an hour-long speech, with a brief Q & A, which you can watch here.

In the passage in question (at about the 10-minute mark), Bryson was talking about the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference, commonly known as the Copenhagen Summit, and the perception that nothing was accomplished because no treaty was reached.

Bryson made a case that, actually, they did accomplish a good deal. Although it fell short of the binding pact hoped for by many environmental groups, the summit produced a nonbinding emissions deal knows as the Copenhagen Accord.

According to a New York Times account on Dec. 20, 2009, ""The plan does not firmly commit the industrialized nations or the developing nations to firm targets for midterm or long-term greenhouse gas emissions reductions. The accord is nonetheless significant in that it codifies the commitments of individual nations to act on their own to tackle global warming.""

""That means there was no binding legal obligations that came out of what happened in Copenhagen,"" Bryson said in his Berkeley address. ""...But those are nonetheless commitments on behalf of the leaders of those countries.""

""Certainly bringing the nations of the world together around addressing climate change and moving toward consensus and effective agreement on working together is vitally important,"" Bryson said.

Bryson talked about the need to think about climate change on a global basis, but at no point did he advocate for ceding power to the United Nations, let alone advocating anything as extreme as creating a world government.

Brian Darling, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation who was quoted in the Daily Caller story, said it may be a rhetorical stretch to suggest that Bryson was advocating a world government. However, Darling said, what Bryson said on the video is of concern. Bryson seems to suggest that he supports giving the U.N. ""authority to impose climate change policy on other countries."" At the least, he said, Bryson ought to be questioned by Congress about the video and made to explain his position.

Myron Ebell, a climate-change skeptic at the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute, said the portion of the clip posted by the Daily Caller ""implies that (Bryson) supports global governing institutions. That is, he supports Kyoto and successor agreements to require mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. These international agreements are administered by an institution, the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), that is administered by the UN, which Bryson says is 'the closest thing we have to a world governance organization.'  Supporting the Kyoto Protocol thus seems to imply that he supports some sort of world governance organization. But not quite necessarily.""

However, Ebell said, ""supporting some global institutions that govern some aspects of life is not the same as supporting world government."" To suggest the clip is evidence that Bryson supports a world government is a ""stretch,"" he said. ""I wouldn’t be surprised to learn that he does, but more evidence is required to establish what he really believes or supports.  I think that what we do know about Mr. Bryson already is sufficient to disqualify him to be Secretary of Commerce from our perspective, which is why we oppose his confirmation.""

We contacted the White House press office to see where Bryson stands on the whole ""world government"" issue, but they declined to comment, saying the fuller context of Bryson's statement -- even in the short clip on the Daily Caller site -- is enough to definitively refute the claim.

We agree. Referring to the United Nations as ""the closest thing we have to a world governance organization"" isn't exactly a smoking gun. We didn't hear any evidence in Bryson's full, hour-long address that suggests he wants to cede the U.S. government's authority over climate change policy to the United Nations, let alone something as radical and all-encompassing as a world government. No wonder the GOP officials who leaked the video and provided the speculation decided to remain anonymous",False,"June 9, 2011"
"""Since President Obama took office, gas prices have gone up 67 percent.""","Some Republicans have repeated an interesting claim about rising gas prices.

U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., joined them in a Twitter post.

""Just the Facts: Since President Obama took office, gas prices have gone up 67 percent,"" the senator wrote.

Isakson included a link to an article with a chart from the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundationthat found gas prices rose 7 percent during the first two years and two months of Republican George W. Bush’s presidency as compared with prices during a similar time span under Barack Obama, a Democrat who took office in January 2009.

We figured Isakson was trying to make a case that Obama is not doing enough to cap rising gas prices. Isakson’s spokeswoman, Lauren Culbertson, told us her boss was indeed making that argument. She said the Obama administration has ""contributed to the increase in gas prices"" by: Some experts dispute the argument that the president can do much about gas prices, saying they are a combination of many factors, such as demand from motorists and nations such as China, along with the rising cost per barrel for crude oil. The United States gets most of its crude oil from Canada, Mexico and OPEC nations such as Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Venezuela.

""[The president] has limited control over gas prices,"" said Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst for GasBuddy.com, an organization aimed at helping motorists find the best gas prices.

First, let’s look at whether the Heritage Foundation got its numbers right.

Crude oil accounts for two-thirds of the price of a gallon of gasoline, according to the federal government. About 10 percent of the cost comes from refining it. About another 10 percent goes toward distribution and marketing. About one-eighth of the cost of gasoline is for taxes.

The foundation’s chart (exact numbers weren’t on the article) shows that average gas prices were slightly below $2 when Bush took office in January 2001. The chart shows prices rose slightly, but were still below $2 in February 2003. Their chart shows gas prices were just below $2 when Obama became president in January 2009 and were $3.10 in February 2011. The Heritage Foundation adjusted its figures for inflation.

The average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was $1.51 the week Bush took office, according to the federal government’s Energy Information Administration. Prices were $1.74 for regular during the last week of February 2003, the EIA reported. That’s a 15.2 percent increase.

By contrast, EIA figures show the average price for a gallon of regular the week Obama took office was $1.83 and has risen steadily since he moved into the White House. During the last week of February, it was $3.34. That is an 82.5 percent increase.

Isakson’s math, courtesy of the Heritage Foundation, is actually lower than the federal government’s totals.

Now, is the context Isakson used to present these numbers on target?

Isakson believes the president should allow more deepwater offshore oil drilling. Obama ordered a moratorium after the disastrous BP oil spill in 2010. The Obama administration approved its first permit since the oil spill, The Associated Press reported last month.

Obama has said domestic oil production rose to a seven-year high in 2010, but others contend that is a result of policies set in place under Bush.

The president has threatened to open the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve to control prices. DeHaan compared that tactic to a classic children’s story.

""That typically cools the market off,"" DeHaan said. ""But we’ve seen so many claims that the traders also discard it. It’s like the boy who cries wolf.""

Gas price analysts such as DeHaan and H. Rao Unnava, a marketing professor at Ohio State University, say market speculation and concerns about political unrest in the Middle East have resulted in a rise in crude oil prices in recent months.

In general, they say, gas prices are largely a result of supply and demand.

Federal government data shows fuel consumption rose each year between 2001 and 2007. The average price for regular gasoline also rose in each of those years. The average price rose again in 2008, when the entire nation was feeling the recession, but consumption fell. Consumption has remained steady since while gas prices have risen since the end of 2008.

""I don’t think [rising gas prices] would have much to do with President Bush or President Obama,"" said Unnava, associate dean of undergraduate programs at Ohio State University’s Fisher College of Business.

Unnava said when gas prices shot past $3 a gallon in the summer of 2006, some conservatives blamed it on increasing demand, particularly in other countries such as China and India. Twenty years ago, China was not among the top five oil consumers. Today, China is second to the U.S.

So where does this leave us? There are two elements to Isakson’s claim: the actual statistics and his implication that Obama is to blame for rising gas prices.

Isakson’s precise statement about gas prices is accurate. They have increased. But the overall statement, intended as a political broadside, leaves out important details and takes things out of  context",Half True,"March 23, 2011"
"Says that President Obama said in 2008 that his proposed greenhouse gas regulations ""will bankrupt"" anyone who wants to build a new coal-fired power plant.","It’s 2008 all over again, based on a claim that recently surfaced from Ohio’s coal industry. That was the year Barack Obama won the presidency. Ten months earlier, the candidate -- a Democratic senator from Illinois who was campaigning for the presidential nomination -- did a wide-ranging, videotaped interview with the San Francisco Chronicle’s editorial board that included his prescription for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Before the campaign would end, his political opponents, including Sarah Palin, discovered the interview on the newspaper’s website and tried to use it against Obama in coal-rich states like Ohio. Maybe you’ve forgotten about it. The coal industry, in a long battle against proposals to cut greenhouse gas emissions by reducing coal use, has not.

Mike Carey, president of the Ohio Coal Association, brought up Obama’s statement anew when he testified March 1 to a House subcommittee on energy and power, in advance of a proposed House Republican bill that would strip the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency of its ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

""We absolutely must oppose the new effort by the Obama administration to eliminate coal through the new proposed plant emissions and greenhouse gas regulations,"" Carey said. ""In 2008, President Obama said, ‘If someone wants to build a new coal-fired power plant they can, but it will bankrupt them because they will be charged a huge sum for all the greenhouse gas that’s being emitted.’ ""

Later in his testimony, Carey added, ""Remember what President Obama promised; they will bankrupt anyone who plans to build a coal facility.""

Did Obama really promise that?

It’s a question that matters in states that employ coal miners and rely on coal-fired electricity, especially as the U.S. EPA under Obama prepares to restrict carbon emissions.

During a break in the House hearing, we asked Carey for his source for the quote. Then we
went back to the original San Francisco Chronicle interview in its entirety, transcribed the parts in which Obama discussed coal, and examined the context of Obama’s remarks.

Obama at the time had proposed an aggressive plan to reduce the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by attaching a price for emissions. The allowable level of emissions would ratchet down yearly, Obama said, with money raised from this system getting invested in cleaner technologies. This would not only create incentives for reducing carbon emissions, he said, but it would also expand the use of wind and solar power, bio-fuels and, potentially, ""clean coal,"" in which carbon emissions could be captured and sequestered in a way that might do no harm. Such clean coal research is ongoing, with vigorous debate as to whether it will someday be applied on a commercial scale.

Obama made clear in the interview that he was not suggesting an end to coal use. Too much of the country already uses it in existing power plants and factories. In a portion of the interview his critics failed to note, he said:

""This notion of no coal, I think, is an illusion, because the fact of the matter is that right now, we are getting a lot of our energy from coal, and China is building a coal-fired plant once a week. So what we have to do then is we have to figure out how can we use coal without emitting greenhouse gases and carbon.  And how can we sequester that carbon and capture it? If we can't, then we're going to still be working on alternatives.""

But Obama also made clear that he wanted to transition away from building new coal-fired plants, saying that the price on emissions for building one -- using old technology -- would be prohibitive under his plan.

Carey said in his testimony that the Obama administration ""promised"" a ""war on coal,"" which is a claim we believe goes too far. The Obama administration has unquestionably angered the coal industry with rules or proposals affecting air quality standards, coal ash, renewable energy and the issuance of permits needed for coal mining -- all mentioned by Carey in his testimony. But Obama never declared war, and environmentalists and many others have a very different take on this so-called assault.

Yet Obama said exactly what Carey quoted him as saying on a point that is especially current, considering the EPA’s new rules, announced this year. To repeat the then-candidate’s statement: ""If someone wants to build a new coal-fired power plant they can, but it will bankrupt them because they will be charged a huge sum for all the greenhouse gas that's being emitted.""

Why, then, aren’t we rating Carey’s claim True?

Two reasons: ""President Obama"" did not make the statement. Obama the U.S. senator and candidate for president did. And that leads to the second reason.

Carey suggests that Obama is carrying out the threat he made in 2008, but the new rules from the EPA are different from the cap-and-trade proposal Obama had in 2008. Candidate Obama’s methods were to be more aggressive. In fact, the EPA has shown some flexibility, agreeing to phase in carbon restrictions on new or expanded plants based on their size. The agency also announced on the same day as Carey testified that it will delay its deadlines for businesses that must report their emissions.

Carey quoted Obama accurately but not fully, and the regulations and methods that Obama’s EPA wants -- backed by a U.S. Supreme Court decision saying the agency has to regulate greenhouse gas emissions -- are not the same as the candidate proposed",Mostly True,"March 14, 2011"
"""[Tailpipe emissions rules], if fully implemented with all the regulations that go with it, they will keep the temperature from rising nearly five one-hundredths of a degree Fahrenheit. By 2050.""","During a recent speech at a Tea Party rally, Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli took plenty of shots at the Environmental Protection Agency.

The Republican, an unabashed critic of global warming claims, called the EPA  ""the Employment Prevention Agency.""

While discussing the EPA’s endangerment finding that greenhouse gasses ""threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations,"" Cuccinelli voiced contempt for new regulations that will limit tailpipe emissions.

""It turns out that they believe, that if fully implemented with all the regulations that go with it, they will keep the temperature from rising nearly five one-hundredths of a degree Fahrenheit. By 2050.""

As the crowd laughed and jeered, the attorney general added, ""I might not be able to see my breath by then.""

Only 0.05 degrees by 2050? Is that really what the EPA was claiming these rules would do?

Brian Gottstein, Cuccinelli’s director of communications, referred us to the EPA’s massive document on light-duty vehicle greenhouse gas emission standards. He pointed us to page 4-101, deep in the document. It said: ""EPA modeled the anticipated potential effect on climate change and found that in year 2100, the rule would reduce temperature increases by 0.006-0.015 degrees Celsius.""

Those Celsius figures translate to a range from 0.011 to 0.027 degrees Fahrenheit.

Cuccinelli had claimed there would be a 0.05 reduction in temperature increases by 2050. So he actually spoke in the EPA’s favor, overstating the expected reduction and saying it would happen 50 years faster than the agency claims.

We also called the EPA and asked them to quantify any temperature reductions that could be expected under the new rules, which affect cars in model years 2012 through 2016. Spokeswoman Enesta Jones e-mailed us a response.

""EPA estimated that the 2012-2016 light duty tailpipe standards would reduce the global mean temperature by 0.006 to 0.015 °C by 2100. The approach used to estimate changes in global mean temperature evaluates the impact of the rule’s emissions reductions in the context of global [greenhouse gas] emissions,"" she wrote. ""Although the projected reductions are small in overall magnitude by themselves, they are quantifiable and would contribute to reducing climate change risks.""

The new EPA limits would establish in 2012 model cars the first-ever caps on carbon dioxide emissions by cars and light trucks. Over the next five years the limits would toughen by about 14 percent. The rules would also push fuel efficiency from 33.8 miles per gallon for passenger cars in the 2012 model year up to 39.5 miles per gallon in 2016.

The agency says these new rules would add about $950 to the price of each new car but that the higher price would be offset by lower fuel costs over three to five years.

Let’s review. The Virginia attorney general said the EPA’s new tailpipe emissions rules for cars and other light-duty vehicles would reduce temperature increases by 0.05 degrees Fahrenheit. He said this would occur by 2050.

The EPA said the reductions would be between 0.011 degrees Fahrenheit and 0.027 degrees Fahrenheit and would occur by 2100. The agency’s claim is even more modest than Cuccinelli suggested.

Speaking without notes at a cold outdoor rally, the attorney general came pretty close to hitting the actual EPA claim, and he actually erred in the agency’s favor by overstating the size of projected reductions. He also missed the date, but again erred in the EPA’s favor",True,"January 28, 2011"
"Rick Boucher ""helped write"" the cap-and-trade bill","The cap-and-trade bill to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is dominating the race for the 9th Congressional District seat out in the heart of coal country.

Republican challenger Morgan Griffith is pounding Democratic incumbent Rick Boucher for voting in favor of cap-and-trade. Griffith claims the legislation will kill jobs in the district, already beset with high unemployment.

A recent Griffith TV ad features a repeated clip of President Barack Obama professing, ""I love Rick Boucher."" The narrator says: ""Love the Obama Washington agenda? Rick Boucher does. Obama’s cap-and-trade plan kills our jobs and raises electricity costs. Boucher helped write it.""    

Cap-and-trade has stalled in the U.S. Senate. But PolitiFact Virginia wanted to examine what role Boucher had, if any, in drafting the legislation.  

What exactly is cap-and-trade?

Under the bill, the government would set a limit on how much carbon companies, such as electric utilities or manufacturers, can emit. The government would then issue permits for emissions to companies and allow them to buy and sell the permits with each other. Supporters say the policy would create a free-market system that will reduce emissions. Opponents argue that that it will kill jobs that rely on coal and other traditional fuel sources.

Griffith bases his claim that Boucher helped write the bill to on a story on news website SWVA Today in which Boucher defended his vote for cap-and-trade and acknowledged having a part in amending the bill.

Asked to clarify his role, Boucher explained that the alternative to cap-and-trade was to leave regulation to the Environmental Protection Agency, which he said  would be devastating for companies that rely on coal and their employees.

""That would be the worst possible outcome for the coal industry, coal jobs, for electric utilities that burn coal and electric consumers,"" Boucher told PolitiFact Virginia.

As a senior member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Boucher said he amended the legislation at the request of the coal and electric power industries in an effort to minimize the impact on coal jobs.  

Boucher’s changes included emissions credits that ensured that power plants could continue to use coal so long as they find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

""It’s certainly accurate to say that I was deeply involved in the process, but the ad is extraordinarily misleading because it suggests that I was doing this because it was something that the President of the Speaker of the House wanted,"" Boucher said. ""In fact, I took them on to get the deal that I got for coal.""

Boucher’s intentions were defended by Phil Smith, a spokesman for the United Mine Workers of America, who said the congressman went to bat for coal.

""The truth of the matter is that when that bill was originally introduced, there wasn’t one single dime in there in support of the coal industry,"" he said. ""What Rick Boucher did was to get involved in the negotiations and put $180 billion into it for coal.""   

Smith added: ""Without him getting involved, the handwriting would be on the wall for the coal industry at this point.""  

Melissa McHenry with American Electric Power said that the company was supportive of those changes that Boucher had made to cap-and-trade.

""It supports continued use of coal,"" she said. ""The alternative is EPA regulation and he recognized that that would have a significant impact to the detriment of the coal industry.""  

Let’s look back at the details.

Did Boucher help write cap-and-trade? Absolutely. But he did so to add protections for the coal industry and the jobs it provides in his district.

The ad implies that Boucher contributed to a job-killing bill, but his motive was to actually protect those jobs. So while the statement is accurate that he helped write it, the ad leaves out important details",Half True,"October 28, 2010"
"Tells David Cicilline, ""94 percent of the carbon emissions which you so want to get rid of are caused by nature.""","We all know about the theory of climate change, the idea that the earth is gradually warming because of pollution. Whenever the weather turns particularly hot or cold, we joke about it, often in supportive or derisive terms depending on our opinion on the issue.

Unlike some other Republicans who dismiss global warming, John Loughlin, who is running for Congress in the 1st District, has acknowledged that the climate is changing. However, he said during a September press conference, ""I think the data is unclear as to the extent of man-caused climate change. When you look at the total percentage of greenhouse gas emissions, a good number of them, in fact, the vast majority of them, are naturally occurring.""

He made a similar statement Oct. 19 during a WPRI/Providence Journal debate when challenged on the topic by his Democratic rival, David Cicilline. ""I'm not a scientist but I did work for NASA and when I was at NASA we had a scientist who I actually did some of the press release work for by the name of Dr. James Hansen at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Dr. Hansen released a peer-reviewed paper in the '70s that talked about global cooling. And then it's only later that he's kind of gotten a conversion to global warming.""

He went on to tell Cicilline, ""I'm saying really the earth is warming, but it's not conclusively caused by man. It's not conclusive. I mean 94 percent of the carbon emissions which you so want to get rid of are caused by nature.""

When people talk about carbon emissions, they are mostly talking about carbon dioxide, the gas we exhale and the gas plants need to grow. Unfortunately, when levels in the air become too high, it traps heat coming from the sun as part of the so-called ""greenhouse effect."" (Other gases such as methane and ozone also play a role, as do tiny particles known as aerosols.) The warmer air melts polar caps, raises sea levels and shifts ecosystems toward the poles. Plants and animals that can't adapt risk extinction.

Loughlin's 94-percent figure sounds very authoritative and specific. So we emailed Loughlin's campaign on Oct. 21, and called his spokeswoman a day later, to ask for the source. They have not responded.

Meanwhile, we emailed a copy of Loughlin's debate comment to Hansen.

""I never had any global cooling paper or talk or comment,"" he wrote back to us. ""The change of carbon dioxide, the increase year to year is entirely human-made. There is an up-and-down flux caused by vegetation growing (sucking carbon dioxide from the air) and decaying in the winter (releasing carbon dioxide), which is large -- this fluctuation is natural and does not alter the annual mean increase due to humans. He is speaking nonsense.""

So Hansen is saying that 0 percent of the increase in climate-changing carbon dioxide emissions is coming from nature, not the 94 percent claimed by Loughlin.

We still wondered where Loughlin might have gotten his 94-percent figure. So we contacted William F. Ruddiman, author of a widely used climate textbook who is at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.

He agreed with Hansen, saying that nature sends a lot of carbon in and out of the atmosphere every year and the sources can be pinpointed because fossil-fuel carbon has a slightly different composition than the carbon that is constantly recycled by nature.

Before the industrial revolution, the atmosphere had roughly 600 billion tons of carbon dioxide, according to Ruddiman. Above-ground vegetation contains about 610 billion tons of carbon and the surface oceans contain about 1,000 billion tons. (There's another 1,550 billion tons or so hidden in the soil and more in the deep ocean, but that doesn't circulate fast enough to play a big role in changes over decades or centuries.)

Each year, the atmosphere and ocean exchange about 75 billion tons; another 100 billion tons go back and forth between the air and the vegetation.

""In those exchanges, the carbon is just moving back and forth in nature and in equal numbers, so there is no net gain to the atmosphere,"" Ruddiman said.

Now add in the pollution generated by humans.

""I think what humans are doing now is something like 30 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year,"" said Ruddiman. That amount is small compared with the amount shuttled back and forth between the air, ocean and vegetation, and perhaps half of that gets pulled out of the air.

So we did some math. When there's 175 billion tons going into the air from natural sources along with 30 billion tons of pollution (for a total of 205 billion tons), that's 85 percent from natural sources.

The only problem: the 175 billion tons comes back out every year, so when critics say humans are having only a small impact on the process, they are misunderstanding -- or misstating -- the process, Ruddiman said.

""The amount of carbon dioxide humans are putting into the atmosphere is smaller but it's not balanced, and so it builds up over time and it causes a sizable net gain,"" Ruddiman explained.

""It may be 10 billion tons a year but much of it builds up year after year after year,"" he said, and persists in the atmosphere, trapping heat like a chemical blanket.

Scientists who have used a variety of techniques to track earth's changing climate over hundreds of thousands of years have found data that show carbon dioxide levels during that period never grew faster than 30 parts per million per 1,000 years. Yet the level has risen by that amount in just the last 17 years, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the international organization widely regarded by the scientific community as a leading authority on the topic.

The result is the warmer temperatures and melting icecaps widely documented around the globe.

And what about volcanoes? People think of them as sending lots of carbon dioxide in the air. It turns out that eruptions are a drop in the bucket, generating 0.2 billion tons annually, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

We also asked Ruddiman about the concept of global cooling, which critics also focus on. The fact is, in the 1970s, geologists were saying earth was coming out of a warm period and destined for another ice age. Core samples taken from the ocean floor combined with other data had allowed them to track the timing of past ice ages as changes in the earth's orbit exposed the planet to varying amounts of sunlight.

But even as scientists were tracking those cycles, which extend over thousands of years, other researchers in the '70s were warning that a carbon dioxide build-up was going to disrupt that cycle and overwhelm the natural cooling trend.

""I remember thinking that probably in one thousand to two thousand years, at most, we would see snow start accumulating in the high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere,"" Ruddiman said. ""That was reasonable from what we knew from ice age cycles. What very few of us were aware of was the buildup of carbon dioxide. Most of us are geologists, not geochemists,"" he said, explaining that by the 1980s the problem had become obvious.

""The same people who said, 'If nature remains in control we're going into a glaciation in the next 1,000 or 2,000 years' turned around and said, 'Yeah, but nature's not in control. Humans are intervening much faster than nature can do the job and so we're going into a warmer time,' "" Ruddiman recalled.

""It's been made to sound like scientists are flip-flopping, but it's just the natural evolution of science,"" he said. ""You broaden your point of view as you gain information that changes your conclusions. And that's what happened.""

Ultimately, the Loughlin campaign did not provide any evidence that nature is responsible for the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is the key problem stoking the fears of global warming. And the NASA scientist he mentioned told us Loughlin's comments were ""nonsense.""

There's plenty of room to debate aspects of climate change, such as the best way to prevent climate-related problems, how much money should be spent on prevention, and whether it's worth the investment if other countries aren't willing to seriously limit their carbon emissions.

But Loughlin's suggestion that nature is largely responsible for the looming problem is wrong",False,"October 28, 2010"
"Says Lloyd Doggett voted for the health care, stimulus and cap-and-trade bills.","Seeking to unseat U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, Republican nominee Donna Campbell of Columbus paints him as a ""career politician"" with some questionable positions. In an ad posted online Oct. 19, the narrator compares Doggett and Campbell, an ""emergency room doctor."" ""They disagree on ObamaCare: Doggett voted yes, Dr. Campbell says repeal. Stimulus spending: Doggett voted yes, Dr. Campbell says it's a waste of money. Cap and trade: Doggett voted yes, Campbell says job killer."" We're not weighing in on whether the stimulus was a waste of money, or if cap and trade is a job killer. But since earlier this month we rated True Doggett's statement that he voted against ""big bank bailouts,"" we were curious whether Campbell accurately recapped his votes on other high-dollar issues. Amanda Tyler, Doggett's campaign manager, told us by e-mail that Doggett voted for each piece of legislation, though the campaign has reservations about the visuals in Campbell's ad; for example, she said, a shot of a foreclosure sign doesn't make sense in connection with his vote for stimulus aid. Let's review Doggett's votes one at a time. Health care On Nov. 7, 2009, the U.S. House voted on its version of health care legislation in a 220-215 vote. Doggett joined 218 Democrats and one Republican, Rep. Anh Cao of Louisiana, in passing the legislation. On March 21, 2010 , Doggett voted for legislation reconciling Senate and House versions of the proposal. The compromise passed 220-211, with no Republicans in support. Doggett said in a floor speech ""with this reform, every insured American gets valuable consumer protections, and every uninsured American can become insured."" We later rated that statement as True. Stimulus On Jan. 28, 2009, the House passed the $819 billion economic recovery bill 244-188 without a single Republican vote. Doggett voted ""aye."" ""One way this bill promotes economic recovery is by promoting educational opportunity,"" he said on the House floor the day before. ""$13.5 billion of targeted tax relief to help young people and not-so young people attend college. Today, one out of five graduating high school students does not qualify for this assistance. But because we provided a refundable tax credit, we help them, just as the appropriations section of this bill helps with expanded Pell Grants and other direct aid."" We asked Campbell's campaign why it showed an image of foreclosure sign while describing Doggett's vote for the stimulus legislation. Mike Asmus, Campbell's campaign manager, told us ""the stimulus spending Lloyd Doggett has voted for has prolonged the narrative of economic malaise, running from joblessness to foreclosure and beyond."" Cap and trade Doggett voted for a cap-and-trade measure aimed at reducing greenhouse gases. With Doggett's vote, that proposal cleared the House 219-212 on June 26, 2009, though Doggett also aired objections about the measure being too soft, saying the plan stripped too much oversight from the Environmental Protection Agency and encouraged new coal-fired plants. ""I struggled deeply about whether to support this flawed bill, but I finally determined that voting for it was my best hope for making it better,"" he said on the floor that day. ""I've been listening to the debate — not so much to those who support a bill that I'm not all that enthusiastic about, but listening to the Flat Earth Society and the climate-change deniers, and some of the most inane arguments I have heard against refusing to act on this vital national security challenge."" Tyler also told us that Doggett hoped to improve the bill by being tapped to serve as a House member of a possible House-Senate conference committee on the plan. That panel never was named; the House-approved bill stalled in the Senate. Our vote? The ad's imagery might be objectionable (at least to Doggett).

"""I don’t understand what Republicans are doing against this. It was their idea. John McCain introduced cap and trade legislation three times.""","Democratic Rep. John Boccieri has taken heat from Republicans ever since his 2009 vote for a House energy bill that would establish a ""cap and trade"" system designed to reduce emission of the greenhouse gasses thought to cause global warming.

The system would impose a government cap on allowable emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses. Companies that emit carbon dioxide, like electric utilities, would either have to reduce emissions by using cleaner technology, or purchase credits to allow continued emissions. Either way, the cost likely would be passed along to consumers. Critics of the program have said it would be particularly harmful in Ohio, where a high proportion of electricity is derived from coal-burning power plants that would be most affected by the proposed law.

Groups like the National Republican Congressional Committee have criticized Boccieri for his vote, placing ads in his district that say the system amounts to a nationwide electricity tax that would drive up the nation’s electricity rates.

Boccieri, from Alliance, Ohio, has repeatedly said that he favored the bill because it would create renewable energy jobs in his district that can’t be shipped overseas, and would protect national security by reducing dependence on foreign oil from unstable regions like the Middle East.

During an interview Aug. 18, he stated the ""cap and trade"" concept was originally a Republican idea, and expressed frustration with the GOP’s current opposition.

""Only in Washington can you propose an idea, introduce legislation and then campaign against it,"" Boccieri said. ""I don’t understand what Republicans are doing against this. It was their idea. John McCain introduced cap and trade legislation three times.""

Boccieri is correct that the ""cap and trade"" concept was pioneered by Republicans.

MIT economics professor Richard Schmalensee and Harvard Kennedy School government professor Robert Stavins noted in July that Ronald Reagan used a ""cap-and-trade"" system to phase out leaded gasoline and George H.W. Bush established a ""cap-and-trade"" system that reduced the sulfur dioxide emissions that cause acid rain.

In 2003, McCain, an Arizona Republican, and Sen. Joe Lieberman, then a Democrat from Connecticut, introduced the ""Climate Stewardship Act,"" which would have used a similar cap-and-trade approach to reduce carbon pollution linked to global warming. Versions of the bill were reintroduced in 2005 and 2007.

""The enormous economic costs of damage caused by air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions to the environment and human health are not factored into the price of power produced by fossil-fueled technologies,"" McCain said in a floor speech to mark the bill’s 2007 introduction. ""Yet, it’s a cost that we all bear, too often in terms of ill-health and diminished quality of life.""

McCain’s 2007 version was cosponsored by Illinois Democratic Sen. Barack Obama. And both McCain and Obama had cap-and-trade programs in their presidential platforms.

If cap-and-trade legislation was backed by the 2008 presidential contenders from both political parties, why hasn’t it been a shoo-in for implementation?

In short, working out the details has been complicated.

The carbon emissions that cause global warming behave differently in the atmosphere than the sulfur emissions that cause acid rain, making it harder to design a ""cap-and-trade"" program that will control them. The acid rain program created in the ‘90s ""addressed a relatively small number of major sources that could comply simply by using off-the-shelf-technology. By contrast, carbon dioxide is emitted from sources throughout the economy and cannot be sufficiently addressed by technology currently at our disposal,"" Ohio GOP Sen. George Voinovich told National Journal’s Congress Daily.

Another culprit was legislative maneuvering by the lead sponsors of the House climate bill, Democrats Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Henry Waxman of California. As The New York Times put it, in order to gain passage for the bill  ""a cornucopia of concessions and exemptions"" were granted to ""coal companies, utilities, refiners, heavy industry and agribusiness. The original simplicity was lost, replaced by a bazaar in which those with the most muscle got the best deals.""

McCain’s staff did not respond to our request to discuss his stance on the House cap-and-trade bill that Boccieri supported. Until late August, McCain faced a tough primary battle against former GOP congressman J. D. Hayworth, who had criticized McCain’s support for cap-and-trade.

"Proposed tax changes are a ""handout"" to BP.","On Sept. 2, 2010, the National Taxpayers Union -- a conservative advocacy group -- announced that it would be spending $4 million on an advertising campaign that targets higher energy taxes. Here's the narration of the TV ad: ""Our economy's hurting, but some senators want to weaken an industry creating jobs. America's energy industry supports 9 million jobs, but Congress may double-tax U.S. energy companies, helping foreign companies owned by China and Venezuela, even BP. New taxes will raise your gas prices, make us more dependent on foreign oil, and cost 600,000 American jobs. Tell Congress BP doesn't deserve a handout. No new American energy taxes."" At first, we thought this was an ad decrying the Democratic cap-and-trade proposal, a legislative effort to cap greenhouse gases that Republicans have consistently criticized as a tax on ordinary energy consumers. But that's not what the ad is about. Instead, NTU says the ad is about two changes under consideration by the Obama administration and the Democratic Congress -- rules for ""dual capacity"" taxpayers, and the Section 199 deduction. The ad is correct that the modifications being considered would primarily affect oil and gas companies. Even by the byzantine standards of tax law, these rules are highly arcane. So bear with us as we try to explain how they work and investigate whether the ad portrays them fairly. Our aim is to gauge whether the ad is accurate when it says that making these changes would amount to a ""handout"" to companies like BP. Let's start with the ""dual capacity"" rule. This rule stems from a tax code provision that lets U.S. taxpayers receive credit for taxes paid on income derived overseas, so income is not taxed twice. Say you're a U.S. oil company. You go to a foreign country to extract oil. You pay a 20 percent tax to that country on what you extract. When your U.S. taxes are calculated, you'll get a dollar-for-dollar credit for the taxes paid overseas. Where it starts getting complicated is that some foreign countries charge oil extractors a single payment that includes both the tax and a payment for the right to drill in the first place. So, rather than paying 20 percent tax on what's extracted, the company will have to pay more, because the rights to drill are included in the same levy. (The dual nature of these payments is the origin of the term ""dual capacity."") Whether the company considers this a tax or a royalty payment matters quite a bit for the U.S. company's tax bill because amounts considered to be foreign taxes provide dollar-for-dollar reductions in tax liability, whereas a royalty only permits a deduction, which is a significantly smaller tax benefit than dollar-for-dollar. So, the greater the amount that's considered a foreign tax, the larger the sum that can be deducted from U.S. taxes. Current U.S. tax law deals with this by trying to determine what part is the true tax (and thus eligible for a dollar-for-dollar tax credit) and what is being paid by the company for a specific economic benefit, such as the right to drill (which is only deductible as a business expense). This is a fairly easy process if the foreign country has a straightforward corporate tax structure. But it gets complicated if the country either taxes ""dual capacity"" taxpayers at a different rate than other corporate taxpayers or if it has no basic corporate tax rate at all. In such cases, U.S. companies have more flexibility to call the payments they've made ""taxes"" -- too much flexibility for some critics, who argue that it's an unnecessary loophole that drains the U.S. Treasury of taxes. That's why President Barack Obama, in his fiscal year 2011 budget, and some senators have proposed tightening the rules. We won't get into the guts of the proposed changes here, but the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress' official, non-partisan arbiter of tax policy changes, found that Obama's proposal would collect an additional $8.2 billion between 2010 and 2020. Oil and gas companies aren't the only sector that would be affected, but they are the main companies that will. Now for the second proposal -- eliminating oil and gas companies as beneficiaries of Section 199 of the tax code.  Section 199 is a deduction for companies that produce goods or software or undertake construction projects in the U.S. Passed in 2004, it replaced a previous tax benefit extended specifically to U.S. exporters, struck down as an illegal trade subsidy by the World Trade Organization. Under section 199, U.S. oil and gas companies can take advantage of a lower tax rate. According to Treasury Department testimony in 2009, making oil and gas ineligible is projected to increase federal revenues by $13.2 billion from 2010 to 2019. We won't address the ad's claim that these proposals could result in the elimination of 600,000 jobs, higher gasoline prices or greater dependence on foreign oil, since such estimates are speculative and ultimately not provable. Instead, we'll focus on whether the ad is justified in calling such changes a ""handout"" to BP or other foreign companies.

In the ad's defense, the changes would only affect U.S.-based companies, and by taking away a benefit from a U.S. firm, the government could, in a sense, be advantaging foreign-based firms.

Pete Sepp, NTU's executive vice president, said that the two tax provisions were created to take the sting off the U.S. corporate tax code. Because many of the United States' competitors do not tax the foreign earnings of domestic firms -- but we do -- deductions and exemptions like the two in question here help U.S. competitiveness. ""Taking away one or both these provisions for oil companies -- provisions that exist for a wide variety of firms -- will, in our opinion, necessarily increase the overhead of oil and gas firms (based) here. That means higher costs for those firms -- costs which foreign-based competitors like BP don't have to shoulder.""

Still, ""handout"" is a pretty strong word to describe what's being proposed. In Webster's New World Dictionary, the relevant definition of ""handout"" is ""a gift of food, clothing, etc., as to a beggar."" Allowing for some artistic license to exchange ""BP"" for ""beggar,"" we think the accuracy of ""handout"" depends on whether the government is affirmatively providing a direct benefit to BP. And it's not clear that the government would be doing this if it made these changes.

If the government were to pass these two policy proposals, it would certainly be taking away a benefit granted to U.S.-based oil and gas companies. But would taking away the two benefits from U.S. companies be equivalent to giving a handout to BP? We're not so sure.

Mitchell Kane, a professor at New York University Law School who specializes in international corporate taxation, said the use of the term ""handout"" in this context is ""highly misleading,"" noting that there would be no change at all to BP's tax liability. ""There could be competitive effects, but this is a highly speculative claim, and in any event is not what most people think of as a handout,"" Kane said. ""If your co-worker loses her job, and there is therefore less competition in the company for promotions and future raises, does this mean you have received a 'handout?'""

There's another reason to question whether BP's British owners are the only ones who would benefit if these provisions were to pass. In a globalized economy, some Americans would actually benefit, since foreign companies employ, do business with and pay quarterly dividends to lots of U.S. taxpayers. According to BP's website, it is the largest oil and gas producer and one of the largest gasoline retailers in the United States, as well as the largest non-U.S. company traded on the New York Stock Exchange. And U.S.-based subsidiaries of foreign companies, including BP's U.S. subsidiaries, qualify for Section 199 credits, which weakens the argument that BP would be a clear winner if these changes were made.

It's certainly understandable that U.S. oil companies doing business overseas would be opposed to these proposals -- and perhaps feel picked on, since both changes specifically target their industry. Still, we think the term ""handout"" in this context is questionable -- even hypocritical, since the tax policy the oil companies want to keep in place could easily be described as involving longstanding ""handouts"" for them",Half True,"September 10, 2010"
"A bill to cap carbon emissions ""could cost Ohio 100,000 jobs.""","The only thing better than accusing an opponent of losing jobs in Ohio’s hard-pressed economy is linking him or his party to proposals that might cause even higher Buckeye State unemployment.

That’s what Rob Portman, the Republican running for U.S. Senate, attempts in a TV commercial that says a ""job-killer"" energy tax is ""coming our way from Washington.""

""It could cost Ohio 100,000 jobs we cannot afford to lose,"" Portman says in the ad.

Portman’s concern is shared by business leaders, especially manufacturers. But he nearly steers a legitimate concern off the rails with his 100,000 job-loss figure.

The ""energy tax"" would come from a proposed bill to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Though the so-called cap-and-trade bill would not specifically impose a tax, it’s clear enough what Portman means. The bill would limit carbon emissions while creating a trading system so companies that cut their carbon output – by burning less coal, for instance – could sell their unneeded carbon credits. Companies that needed to exceed the caps could buy those credits.

Unless there was generous help to companies in coal-reliant states like Ohio, a cap-and-trade bill could hurt, because there aren’t enough alternatives right now to coal-fired electricity.

""The fact is that any carbon legislation is designed to make us not use coal,"" says Kevin Hassett, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank in Washington. ""So if you’re a state that has a lot of coal, you’re going to get hammered.""

Theoretically then, Portman’s broad fear is not off the mark, although various studies and analyses make conflicting claims. But Portman strays by claiming the cost could be 100,000 Ohio jobs, and by saying the bill ""is coming our way.""

His job-loss figure comes from an analysis of a bill that the House of Representatives passed last year. Two problems:
  
  
""I sure wouldn’t want to bet the farm on it,"" says Stephen Hess, a senior fellow emeritus at the Brookings Institution, a centrist-liberal think tank. ""I don’t think I’d even want to bet a weekend at Atlantic City.""

The House bill was sponsored by liberal members Edward Markey of Massachusetts and Henry Waxman of California. Senate Democrats don’t have enough of a majority to just rubber-stamp the Waxman-Markey bill, and Democrats like Brown are insisting on better economic protections for coal-reliant states. The campaign of Lee Fisher, Portman’s Democratic rival in the Senate race, says Fisher too believes the Waxman-Markey bill would harm Ohio unless it got better protections.

That doesn’t mean a compromise cannot be fashioned, and several are on the table. One would require provisions to keep foreign manufacturers that don’t have carbon restrictions from gaining advantage and taking jobs from the United States. Another would grant extra carbon credits to keep companies in Ohio and similar states from paying too much while they transitioned to greener energy sources. Yet another, being considered as a separate bill that has President Barack Obama’s support, would create clean-energy manufacturing grants to help companies develop jobs in wind, solar and other alternative energy sources.

Different interest groups, economists and lawmakers use different analyses to project the potential job losses or gains from these proposals. The Peterson Institute for International Economics said in May that a climate-change measure introduced by Sen. John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, would prompt enough clean-energy investment in its first decade to add 203,000 new jobs nationally. But higher energy and product prices in the second decade would offset those job gains, the Peterson economists said.

Economists at the University of California at Berkeley had a more optimistic take, saying that adoption of a House-style bill could add as many as 1.9 million jobs nationwide – with 35,000 to 61,000 of those in Ohio – by 2020. That is assuming that states have ""balanced policies"" that utilize not only a cap-and-trade system but also complementary policies for energy efficiency and clean technology, the authors said.

For an additional take, we looked at a Congressional Budget Office analysis, published in May. The CBO examined three independent economic studies by outside groups: Brookings, Resources for the Future, and CRA International, a consulting firm. The CBO’s conclusion from these: Workers who rely on coal and other fossil fuels for their jobs would be affected, but eventually, most workers who lost jobs would find new ones.

In particular, the CBO said, a ""gradually increasing tax on greenhouse gas emissions,"" as envisioned in the Waxman-Markey bill, ""would probably only have a small effect on total employment during the next few decades.""

The CBO did not quantify that, however. So we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and took out our calculator. If 100,000 jobs were lost due to cap-and-trade, as Portman claims, that would represent a loss of anywhere from 2 percent to 2.4 percent of Ohio jobs, depending on how you measure today’s employment. That’s not a small effect – which would seem to put Portman’s claim at odds with the CBO’s analysis.

A loss of 100,000 jobs ""would be quite meaningful"" in terms of overall Ohio employment, says Ken Mayfield, an economist and president of ClearView Economics of Pepper Pike.

In his commercial, Portman couches his number by saying the state ""could"" lose that many jobs. And campaign spokeswoman Jessica Towhey says that Portman uses the 100,000 number because it comes from a legitimate study of the only cap-and-trade bill that has passed a chamber of Congress, making it more realistic than Senate proposals that are speculative for now. If Obama were to demand action, Towhey said, Senate Democrats could quickly line up in support and enact a final cap-and-trade bill.

But the political roadblocks to Waxman-Markey in the Senate make its passage equally speculative -- unless there are concessions for states like Ohio. And Portman chose to use the worst-case conclusion on Waxman-Markey.

In fact, last October another fact-checking outfit, Factcheck.org, affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania, did its own full review of the National Association of Manufacturers’ claim. It examined the national prediction rather than those for individual states, focusing on the claim that cap-and-trade could cost up to 2.4 million jobs.

Factcheck.org turned to the same in-depth study by the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, that backers and detractors of Waxman-Markey were citing at the time. The EIA analyzed 11 different sets of assumptions, every one of which showed there would be fewer jobs in 2030 with the Waxman-Markey bill than without.

But ""only the most severely pessimistic set of assumptions"" produced job losses on the scale cited by the manufacturers, and now repeated by Portman. And remember, that was the worst case scenario from two groups that tend to support big business’ side of the issue",True,"August 2, 2010"
"""In the 18th Congressional District, 100% of electric generation comes from coal.""","State Sen. Bob Gibbs wants to make sure you know coal is important in Ohio’s 18th Congressional District and that he doesn’t like efforts to shrink the district’s carbon footprint.

""In the 18th Congressional District, 100% of electric generation comes from coal. That means that every single household in this district will see a huge increase in their energy bills if Cap-and-Trade would become law.""

It’s true that all electricity generated in the 18th is produced at coal-fired power plants, but that doesn’t mean when residents flick on their lights they are not also using electricity from other sources.

Much of the district gets power from rural electric cooperatives. Other areas, though, are serviced by FirstEnergy Corp.’s Ohio Edison and AEP Ohio’s Columbus Southern Power Co. and Ohio Power Co.

First Energy has ownership stakes in two nuclear power plants in Ohio and a third in Pennsylvania. AEP Ohio has two plants in Ohio that burn natural gas to generate power and a hydro-electric plant on the Ohio River.

Still, all power generating plants actually located within the district are coal-fired",True,"July 24, 2010"
"""Sen. George LeMieux voted to let oil companies off the hook and overturn pollution rules.""","In late June 2010, the Florida Conservation Alliance -- an affiliate of the League of Conservation Voters, an environmental group -- bought what it called a ""substantial"" amount of television time in the Tampa Bay area to run an ad critical of Sen. George LeMieux, R-Fla.

Here's the narration: ""It’s the worst oil disaster in American history, and Floridians are bracing for the consequences. But at a time when we need leaders who will fight for Florida’s economy and environment, Sen. George LeMieux voted to let oil companies off the hook and overturn pollution rules. Senator, when you fight to protect our coasts, we’re with you. But when you stand with Big Oil, you let us down. Call Senator LeMieux. Tell him not to disappoint us again, and to support a strong, clean energy future.""

The visuals were almost exclusively tied to the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico -- oil gushing underwater, soiled beaches, petroleum-soaked birds, the flaming Deepwater Horizon oil rig.

In this sense, the ad reminded us of one we rated recently that had been placed in several media markets by Americans United for Change, a liberal advocacy group. In both ads, the focus on the oil spill -- in both the narration and the visuals -- suggested to us that reasonable people would assume that the vote ""to let big oil off the hook"" would have something to do with the spill itself, such as a vote to limit BP's liability for paying damages.

In reality, both ads refer to a different measure in Congress -- one that has nothing directly to do with the oil spill itself.

The vote cited in an on-screen footnote was on a procedural motion to take up a joint resolution sponsored by Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. This measure would disapprove a rule submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency that classified greenhouse gasses as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act. That classification would allow the EPA to act to curb emissions by big polluters that could be causing global warming.

The resolution was the latest salvo in a fight between industry and environmentalists over curbing emissions. The EPA effort, blocked during the administration of George W. Bush, was revived after Barack Obama became president. The vote was seen as a key preliminary decision in advance of possible Senate consideration of a ""cap-and-trade"" emissions bill -- a major bone of contention between the parties.

Major oil companies could be at a competitive disadvantage if the EPA acts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, since burning oil and other fossil fuels produces a lot of carbon dioxide.

It's worth noting that the resolution failed, 47 to 53, so the Senate never really wiped out what the group terms ""protections that hold polluters accountable."" But there's little question that the vote was important. ""If ever there was a vote to find out whose side you are on, this is it,"" said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

But was it related to the oil spill? Not really. And to us, that makes it an example of an ad that isn't wrong, but is misleading.

The ad says nothing about the specific topic of the vote at issue -- be it greenhouse gasses, emissions, or global warming -- but it does mention the oil spill several times in the narration. And almost all of the imagery highlights the spill.

(The other ads are identical except that the names and campaign donation totals are personalized to the targeted senator).

What's worse than taking big bucks from big oil? Wiping out protections that hold polluters accountable. Yep. Even with disaster on our coast and Iran using oil money against us, Richard Burr voted to let big oil off the hook. Sen. Burr, next time, look out for America's clean energy future, not big oil profits."" This narration is accompanied by a string of visuals, including footage of oil gushing out of the damaged BP well head, oily water washing on a beach, an oil-covered bird, an oil burn in the Gulf of Mexico, a hand-lettered ""Beach Closed"" sign, and an aerial view of vessels working on the recovery from the oil spill. Given the focus in both the narration and the visuals on the oil spill, we think that reasonable people watching the ad would assume that the vote it references -- ""to let big oil off the hook"" -- would have something to do with the spill itself, such as a vote to limit BP's liability for paying damages.

"""A major part"" of the climate change bill sponsored by Sens. John Kerry and Joe Lieberman ""was essentially written by BP.""","The ongoing oil spill caused by a damaged BP well in the Gulf of Mexico is bringing attention to the relationship between the oil conglomerate and politicians. On June 9, 2010, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., used a floor speech to link BP and a climate-change bill sponsored by Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Joe Lieberman, I-Conn.

""The problem for Democrats is that debating the Democrat cap-and-trade bill might not fit neatly into the White House messaging plan, since it’s been widely reported that a major part of the Kerry-Lieberman bill was essentially written by BP. This is clearly an inconvenient fact: an administration that seems to spend most of its time coming up with new ways to show how angry it is with BP is pushing a proposal that BP helped write.""

McConnell touched on a lot of points in this excerpt, but the one that most interested us was whether ""a major part of the Kerry-Lieberman bill was essentially written by BP.""

When we asked McConnell's office for evidence to support this charge, a spokesman provided us with links to several news reports. These stories -- published over the past few months in the Washington Post, in the Capitol Hill newspaper The Hill, and in the energy-and-environment trade publication Greenwire -- offer ample evidence that BP was involved in the long-running negotiations over the bill, and that the company spoke favorably about the measure as it was being drafted.

The articles indicated that BP, along with Shell, ConocoPhillips and the Edison Electric Institute, would ultimately endorse the measure. In fact, one article specifically noted that BP CEO Tony Hayward -- not yet the internationally known face of the disaster -- gave a speech at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in March in which he ""indicated he was encouraged"" by the Kerry-Lieberman effort.

Aides to Kerry and Lieberman do not dispute that BP was involved in the negotiations, along with many other parties.

""The senators met with more than 60 of their colleagues and all involved stakeholders, including environmentalists, religious leaders and the business community,"" said Whitney Smith, a spokeswoman for Kerry.

""The senators worked with a diverse set of colleagues and stakeholders to develop their discussion draft,"" added Lieberman spokesman Marshall Wittmann. ""They met with the CEOs of Shell, BP and Conoco because their industry will be regulated under the bill and it was important to ensure that the bill's approach to transportation emissions would reduce oil dependence. They also met with members of the business and environmental community in an effort to ensure that the bill met all of their goals: to grow the economy, create jobs and clean our air.""

But it's one thing for a company's representatives to meet with Congressional aides, make the company's case and suggest that they may endorse a bill. It's another to actually write legislation. On this point, Kerry and Lieberman's offices are clear: ""Senators, not any industry, wrote this proposal, and any suggestion to the contrary is false and politically motivated,"" said Smith, the spokeswoman for Kerry.

Let's delve into the evidence.

On March 24, Houston Chronicle energy blogger Tom Fowler reprinted a ""discussion draft"" by BP that advocated several policy positions related to hydraulic fracking. That's a technique that allows energy companies to unlock natural gas by injecting chemicals into underground reservoirs. Critics have suggested that the procedure risks tainting adjoining water supplies, and they have urged lawmakers to establish tight controls on the process.

As reprinted in Fowler's blog, the ""discussion draft"" argued that ""governments and industry have critical roles toward continuing to assure the public that hydraulic fracturing operations are effectively managed and regulated and that human health and the environment are protected."" Among other things, the draft sought to maintain ""the confidentiality of trade secret information.""

However, this language was not included in the draft bill that Kerry and Lieberman released a month later. Quite the opposite: The bill draft said that ""a hydraulic fracturing service company shall disclose all chemical constituents used in a hydraulic fracturing operation to the public on the Internet in order to provide adequate information for the public and state and local authorities"" -- a much more stringent standard than that sought by BP.

It's also worth noting that the BP ""discussion draft"" was not even intended to be actual language in the bill. Rather, it was intended as language for a ""Sense of the Senate"" resolution, which, unlike the law itself, is not binding.

BP also sought a federal pre-emption for automobile tailpipe emissions, said Jeremy Symons, senior vice president at the National Wildlife Federation. That means that BP wanted the federal government to set a universal standard for emissions, rather than having states set their own levels, which could allow some states -- especially California -- to set stricter limits. Such a policy has been a longstanding item on the industry's agenda for climate change regulation.

In this case, too, the Kerry-Lieberman draft bill specifically maintained the right of states to set emissions limits, leaving BP's idea on the cutting-room floor.

And BP and other players in the industry proposed increasing gasoline taxes at the pump rather than curbing vehicular emissions through a direct cap, said John Coqueyt, a legislative specialist with the Sierra Club, an environmental group. After making progress initially, this idea was abandoned in the Kerry-Lieberman draft, Coqueyt said.

""On the one hand, BP did have substantial input into the Kerry bill,"" said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign at the Center for Auto Safety. BP, other oil companies, the Edison Electric Institute and other industry groups ""submitted much language and many ideas. Some are probably recognizable in the current bill. ... But I don't think it is accurate to say that BP essentially wrote a major part of the bill.""

We agree. There's no question that BP, by taking a cooperative stance with Kerry and Lieberman rather than an adversarial one, had the opportunity to float its ideas during the legislative drafting process. And by dangling the possibility that the company might back the bill -- which would provide the senators with politically valuable support on a complicated and contentious bill -- BP and other energy companies wielded some leverage in the drafting process. In fact, many on the left -- not just conservatives like McConnell-- are disappointed that Kerry and other Democratic supporters of climate change legislation worked with oil companies, including BP, while crafting the bill. But saying that the senators listened to BP's case is not the same as saying that ""a major part"" of the bill ""was essentially written by BP.""

In fact, looking at three BP-pushed initiatives that have come to light shows that none were included in the current draft of the bill, which suggests that the senators and their aides were hardly captive to BP. It may be revealing that one day after the statement we're checking, McConnell had toned down his description of BP's role. In a floor speech on June 10, 2010, McConnell said, ""Some favor the Kerry-Lieberman cap-and-trade bill, a significant portion of which, by the way, has been pushed by the oil company BP."" If he'd simply said ""pushed"" the day before, he would have been pretty close to being accurate. But McConnell went much further when he said that BP had ""essentially written"" a ""major part"" of the bill",False,"June 14, 2010"
"""Every major study that has been done by a legitimate group ... shows that there are hundreds of thousands of jobs to be created if you pass our (cap-and-trade) legislation. And if you wind up pricing carbon.""","The latest version of cap-and-trade legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gases and encouraging a shift to more sustainable energy sources was unveiled by Sens. John Kerry and Joe Lieberman on May 12, 2010. It's called the American Power Act.

One of the biggest knocks on the bill from conservative opponents is that the bill would be a job killer.

Sen. Kerry addressed that claim on ABC's ''This Week'' on June 6, 2010:

""Every major study that has been done by a legitimate group ... shows that there are hundreds of thousands of jobs to be created if you pass our (cap-and-trade) legislation. And if you wind up pricing carbon.""

Kerry accurately cited the findings of the May 20, 2010, analysis of the American Power Act's job impact by the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics.

According to the report, ""The American Power Act prompts $41.1 billion in annual electricity sector investment between 2011 and 2030, $22.5 billion more than under business as usual. Given that the United States is currently below full employment with most economists projecting a slow labor market recovery, this investment is more stimulative than inflationary in the first decade, resulting in an average annual increase in U.S. employment of 203,000 jobs above business as usual, with the net of the jobs lost in fossil fuel production and as a result of higher energy prices between 2001 and 2020. In the second decade of the program, higher energy and product prices offset the employment gains from new investment.""

But was Kerry right that every other major study done by a legitimate group came to the same conclusion that the bill would create hundreds of thousands of jobs?

First of all, we couldn't find any other studies that specifically analyzed the employment impact of the American Power Act. It was only introduced less than a month ago. Several economic groups have studies underway, but the Peterson Institute appears to have reached the clubhouse first.

But there are plenty of economic studies of generic cap-and-trade plans, as well as ones that specifically analyzed the version passed by the House last year. And some of their conclusions about job impact contradict the findings of the the Peterson Institute.

In fact, on May 5, 2010, the government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a report on how policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could affect employment. The CBO's analysis of research ""concluded that total employment during the next few decades would be slightly lower than would be the case in the absence of such policies. In particular, job losses in the industries that shrink would lower employment more than job gains in other industries would increase employment, thereby raising the overall unemployment rate.""

CBO reached its conclusion based primarily on the review of three economic modeling studies, by analysts at Resources for the Future (RFF), the Brookings Institution and the consulting firm CRA International.

The CBO ""basically found that most of the studies found there's likely to be a small decrease in employment levels, relative to not doing anything, with the cap-and-trade policy,"" said Adele Morris, policy director of Climate and Energy Economics at the Brookings Institution. They aren't the only ones. Last year, for example, the Marshall Institute produced a report that found ""estimates of job losses (due to cap-and-trade legislation) range from hundreds of thousands to millions."" Said Morris: ""It is certainly not the case that every major study done by a legitimate group found that there would be hundreds of thousands of jobs created. I would like to consider Brookings to be a legitimate group.""

The primary difference for the disparate findings, said Trevor Houser, who led the Peterson study, is that the Peterson study specifically evaluated the effect of the American Power Act, while the reports in the CBO did not. The Peterson report also assessed the bill given the real-time reality of a U.S. economy with unemployment near 10 percent and economists predicting a slow recovery. The reports cited by CBO are ""full employment"" models designed to assess the long-term impact (30 to 50 years), Houser said.

Whitney Smith, press secretary for Kerry, also stressed that the three studies cited in the CBO report were not about Kerry's American Power Act specifically. And Smith cited a Peterson Institute response to the CBO study, which argues that the ""methodological approach of the studies included in the CBO report arguably overstates potential job losses.""

So what other reports was Kerry referring to when he said ""every major study that has been done by a legitimate group, most recently the Peterson Institute of Economics...""?

According to Smith, Kerry was also referencing a report from Third Way, which describes itself as a ""moderate think-tank of the progressive movement."" The report concluded that job losses in ""old industries"" will be more than offset by an increase in clean energy jobs so that ""that carbon pricing will result in net job growth"" of somewhere between 118,000 to 1.1 million jobs.

But the Third Way report isn't a study of the American Power Act either. It's a review of two dozen studies over the last three years of various plans to put a price on carbon. Third Way rejected reports from the ideological left and right and considered just those ""in the middle.""

While the Third Way review did not specifically address the American Power Act, there is nothing in this latest cap-and-trade bill that would make it differ much with regard to the projections about the broad impact on the economy and the number of jobs gained, said Josh Freed, director of the Third Way Clean Energy Program.

If Kerry is going to hang his hat on the fact that none of the other studies (such as those cited in the CBO report) looked at the American Power Act specifically, then we are really only talking about one study, the Peterson Institute study. We aren't aware of any others. Neither are the folks at the Peterson Institute. And the Third Way study cited by the Kerry spokesman isn't an analysis of the American Power Act either.

So the question then is whether the American Power Act is so different from past versions of the cap-and-trade bill, or the generic versions modeled by various economists, that it would render their conclusions irrelevant in analyzing the American Power Act. And many economists we spoke to said that's not the case, that the earlier versions are substantially similar to Kerry's, especially for the purpose of analyzing the bills' jobs impact. And the fact that Kerry's spokesman included the Third Way study suggests they think it's fair game to consider older versions of cap-and-trade legislation for comparative purposes as well.

Economists at the Peterson Institute, the Brookings Institution -- or for that matter at, say, the conservative Heritage Foundation, which projected a cap-and-trade bill could cost millions of jobs -- certainly disagree about each others' methodology. Various economic models employ different assumptions about everything from the viability of doubling the number of nuclear power plants to the prospects for the economy. They all look at different timelines. You may agree or disagree with the findings and methodology of the Peterson Institute study, but the fact is that other ""legitimate groups"" have performed studies and reached different conclusions.

Kerry's statement suggests there is some unanimity of opinion among legitimate organizations about cap-and-trade's effect on jobs. And that's just not so. There is quite a bit of disagreement",False,"June 8, 2010"
"""My opponent in November of 2008 sent a missive to the White House, to President Obama-elect, and said, 'Here's how you need to sell cap-and-trade to the American people.' ""","On May 19 in Houston, Rick Perry revisited his objection to proposals to cap carbon emissions nationally, saying such a change would devastate the energy sector and the Texas economy, according to an online write-up by The Houston Chronicle.

Referring to Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White, Perry said: ""My opponent in November of 2008 sent a missive to the White House, to President Obama-elect, and said, 'Here's how you need to sell cap-and-trade to the American people.'""

To date, there’s no evidence of White supporting the ""cap-and-trade"" scheme. So his advising the Democratic president-elect on how to sell the idea amounts to rich campaign fodder for Perry.

Does Perry recap White's message to Obama accurately?

Some background: Cap-and-trade plans typically try to ratchet down air pollution by making a set number of pollution allowances available to industry. Companies can trade or sell the allowances if their facilities pollute less than they’re allowed. The House passed a bill last year to start such a system, but the legislation has not advanced through the Senate.

To our request for elaboration, Perry’s campaign pointed us to a Nov. 17, 2008 e-mail sent by White, then mayor of Houston, to Rahm Emanuel, who was slotted to become Obama’s chief of staff. The eight-paragraph e-mail, later noted by Perry's campaign in blog posts and an online video advertisement, surfaced on a Chronicle blog on May 18, 2010. White's campaign confirmed the e-mail's authenticity.

Several times, White’s message to Emanuel, under the subject line ""Energy Policy at the Beginning of an Administration,"" refers to the cap-and-trade possibility. Each mention advises against an early push.

White’s e-mail says Obama should focus on ""several high-impact objectives during his first year to make steady progress to meet energy policy goals while also stimulating the economy. But he should not try to do something ‘comprehensive’ on domestic carbon emissions until these tools are in place.""

Later, the e-mail says: ""Avoid during 2009 wading into the mire of cap-and-trade or user taxes on carbon before the new Administration and Congress has made progress"" on White’s energy-related recommendations.

White’s e-mail says: ""A carbon-based tax or sales (scheme) could be characterized as intrusive government increasing costs or simply another scheme to extract money from the public unless there is a clear ‘path forward’ on (a) transportation fuel efficiency; (b) efficiency of electrical power use; and (c) affordable clean power alternatives.""

The message continues: ""The public can understand why we need to lower energy costs, reduce emissions, and cut imports. We can accomplish that goal while reducing carbon emissions. But do not allow the concept of reducing carbon emissions to drive this process. Lowering energy bills with clean domestic energy is a much better approach.""

White’s recommended to-do’s? His e-mail says Obama should accelerate the use of vehicles that use 40 miles per gallon or more. More advice: fund a program to retrofit 1 million homes and apartments occupied by low-income residents. And, he writes, Obama should encourage new power plants to use cleaner-than-coal natural gas, among steps.

White’s campaign spokeswoman, Katy Bacon, said White referred to the cap-and-trade prospect because the idea was debated during the 2008 election year. In his campaign, Obama committed to creating a cap-and-trade system — a promise that PolitiFact has lately rated ""in the works."" Next, we contacted an Austin advertising firm to get another take on whether White's e-mail reads like advice on how to sell cap and trade, as Perry puts it. Patrick Cline, a partner at JH&A Advertising, credited White's message with couching in step with an understanding that a cap-and-trade plan could wreak havoc with the state's petrochemical plants. But, Cline said, White's note stops short of being a primer on selling cap and trade to the American people. Our conclusion: White's e-mail is not close to the ""how-to"" guide Perry claims. Indeed, White's message urges the incoming administration not to push a carbon emissions proposal until after it has advanced other energy-related ideas. Nowhere does the e-mail offer guidance on pitching cap and trade. Perry floats a politically potent but inaccurate, ridiculous characterization",False Pants on Fire,"June 8, 2010"
"The American Power Act ""would cut our dependence on oil in half.""","A recent TV ad from the left-leaning VoteVets.org, which represents American veterans, takes a circuitous route to its real agenda: a plug for the American Power Act, the latest version of the cap-and-trade bill introduced on May 12, 2010, by Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Joe Lieberman, I-Conn.

The ad begins with nasty images from the oil gusher in the Gulf of Mexico.

Then we are introduced to Evan Wolf, a Louisiana National Guardsman who was assigned to Gulf Coast clean up.

""When I signed on to the National Guard, I did it to help protect Americans from our enemies, like in the Persian Gulf, not to clean up an oil company's mess here in the Gulf of Mexico,"" Wolf says.

He holds up a freezer bag filled with a murky goop.

""We'll do whatever mission we're given and do it well,"" Wolf says. ""But America needs a new mission. Because whether it's deep drilling oil out here, or spending a billion dollars a day on oil from our enemies overseas, our dependence on oil is threatening our national security.

""Thing is, a clean American energy plan would cut our dependence on oil in half. It's more power for America, made here in America. Putting our people to work using all the resources we have.""

We then get images of solar and wind farms.

""Some folks in Washington say now is not the time to clean American power,"" Wolf says, and then dabs at oil staining a Louisiana beach. ""I've gotta ask -- if not now … when?"" By way of background, Wolf was a Democratic candidate for the Louisiana House in 2007. He lost, but a Democratic National Committee web page suggests he's at least mulling another run.

VoteVets explained that the ad is advocating for the American Power Act, and that it is that bill that ""would cut our dependence on oil in half."" That's the claim we are checking here.

The American Power Act is the latest version of the cap and trade bill that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Obama put in a plug for the bill in a speech on June 2, 2010, in Pittsburgh. ""The time has come, once and for all, for this nation to fully embrace a clean energy future,"" Obama said, and vowed it would become an administration priority. ""The votes may not be there right now, but I intend to find them in the coming months,"" Obama said.

VoteVets backs up the ad's claim that the American Power Act would ""cut our dependence on oil in half"" by citing a 2009 analysis from the National Resources Defense Council of the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, which was passed by the House on June 26, 2009. The bill sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through a variety of market-based (cap-and-trade) mechanisms, incentives for energy efficiency and the development of clean energy.

The Council's report on the House bill last year concluded that if the bill passed, America's dependence on foreign oil would be cut in half by 2050. But the same report projected that while oil imports would be halved, overall oil consumption would drop by about 12 percent between 2010 and 2050 (from 17.1 million barrels per day to 15 million barrels per day in 2050).

We note that in the ad, Wolf doesn't say the bill would cut consumption of foreign oil in half, it says the bill would ""cut our dependence on oil in half."" There's a difference. VoteVets, which is backing the video with a $1.5 million ad buy, contends the context of the ad makes clear that they are talking about oil imports, but we don't agree. The ad is set against the backdrop of an oil drilling catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico. In his setup, Wolf frames the discussion as ""whether it's deep drilling oil out here, or spending a billion dollars a day on oil from our enemies overseas."" That seems to us like he's talking about oil consumption in general and the need for the United States to ween off it. Reducing dependence on foreign oil would not reduce drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.

It's also worth noting that the government did an analysis of the 2009 House version of the bill and didn't paint quite as rosy a picture as the Council. The U.S. Energy Information Administration would only project to 2030 (not 2050). But the EIA's report projected relatively little change in overall liquid fuel consumption. The report did forecast that U.S. dependence on foreign oil imports would decline, from 8.26 million barrels per day in 2010 to 6.3 million barrels per day in 2030. That's a roughly 24 percent decrease.

But the report also projected a decline in foreign oil imports even without the bill. There are a numbers of reasons for that, said Jonathan Cogan, spokesman for U.S. Energy Information Administration: a slight increase in domestic oil production; increased use of bio-fuels; tighter fuel efficiency standards; and an expected rise in oil prices.

The EIA has not yet finished its analysis of the American Power Act, Cogan noted, though it should be completed in mid to late June. The goals of the Senate bill and last year's House bill may be the same, but the mechanisms are a little different, so using the EIA report on the 2009 House bill to judge the 2010 Senate bill is an ""imperfect comparison,"" Cogan said.

However, Daniel Lashof, director of the Council's Climate Center, said the basic provisions are similar enough that the 2009 analyses are legitimate. Therefore, he said, the Council is comfortable with the projection that the American Power Act has the potential to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil by 50 percent by 2050.

Lashof said part of the reason the Council's projections differed from the EIA's is that EIA did not account for the potential boost to domestic oil production by capturing carbon dioxide from power plants. Recovered carbon dioxide -- encouraged by the bill -- can be injected into depleted oil fields to enhance oil production, Lashof said. As a result, he said, the NRDC projects a slight increase in domestic oil production between now and 2050 under the bill, but in a safer way ""not subject to the kinds of risks of going into deeper and deeper water offshore.""

In summary, the ad claims that if the American Power Act is passed, it would ""cut our dependence on oil in half."" VoteVets says they were talking about cutting dependence on foreign oil in half. And they point to a credible report from the Council that projects a similar bill would cut foreign oil imports in half by 2050. A spokesman for the EIA says basing a projection of the effect of the 2010 Senate bill on an analysis of a similar, but different, 2010 Senate bill is an ""imperfect comparison.""

We also note that the EIA's analysis of the 2009 House version of the bill is less optimistic than the NRDC. But most significantly, we think the context of the ad suggests Wolf is talking about cutting overall oil consumption -- not just foreign oil imports -- in half. If they were only talking about oil imports, why would Wolf be standing on an oil-stained beach in Louisiana? Perhaps newer reports will ultimately back up the VoteVets claim, but they based their claim on a 2009 report that actually projects a much smaller reduction in overall oil consumption",Half True,"June 3, 2010"
"""Bill White ... supports the ‘ObamaCare’ socialized medicine plan, as well as ‘Cap and Trade’ legislation that would kill thousands of Texas jobs.""","We conclude our trifecta of Truth-O-Meter rulings on a February fund-raising letter sent by Texas GOP chair Cathie Adams. She levelled six charges against Democratic gubernatorial candidate Bill White including these pops: ""He supports the ‘ObamaCare’ socialized medicine plan, as well as ‘Cap and Trade’ legislation that would kill thousands of Texas jobs."" Socialist? Job-killer? We decided to test the politically potent charges. (We deal with the rest of Adams' letter in separate Truth-O-Meter items.) On Adams’ claim that White supports the ""‘ObamaCare’ socialized medicine plan,"" the Republican Party initially referred us to an August article in the El Paso Times. The story makes no reference to ""Obamacare"" or ""socialized medicine."" Instead it quotes White saying he backs President Barack Obama’s goals of allowing people to keep their current doctors and insurance plans and expanding the availability of health coverage while containing costs. The article also quotes White referring to his support for employers, employees and public-private partnerships to enable affordable basic health care. His campaign says White was among advocates who persuaded state lawmakers to permit ""3-share"" partnerships.

White also has called for expanding the enrollment of children in Medicaid, which serves the poor, and the federally supported Children's Health Insurance Program, which serves the working poor.

Surprisingly, considering White was a Senate candidate through much of last year, White's campaign says he has not voiced support for any particular health-care plan before Congress.

For Adams’ statement about White supporting a cap-and-trade approach to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the party pointed us to an article published in December's Texas Monthly magazine. Cap-and-trade plans typically try to ratchet down air pollution by making a set number of pollution allowances available. Companies can then trade or sell the allowances if their facilities pollute less than they're allowed.

The article doesn't reveal White’s position on the cap-and-trade idea. Rather, it quotes a press release from a Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman speculating about something White's campaign spokeswoman, Katy Bacon, told the Austin American-Statesman in September: That White had advised Obama on energy topics. The GOP spokesman said: ""President Obama has proposed massive tax hikes on Texas energy companies and a cap-and-trade scheme that would raise energy prices on Texas families. Is this the result of the ‘advice’ Mayor White’s spokesperson referred to today? Texas voters deserve to know exactly which aspects of President Obama’s energy scheme White supports.""

Earlier, White told the American-Statesman he didn't consider the cap-and-trade plan narrowly approved by the U.S. House of Representatives in June ""an effective piece of legislation for accomplishing its goals at a reasonable consumer cost... I’ve shared some of those thoughts with senators, of how we could have an energy policy that’s sustainable and also affordable."" Last week, White said he's never endorsed a cap-and-trade proposal, preferring approaches that would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by encouraging utilities to use more natural gas and renewable energy. ""The closer somebody comes to that approach, the more I support it,"" White said. White also has called for Texas to follow states including California, New York and Massachusetts in adopting state-level low-emission vehicle standards so that ""we help drive down the cost of more fuel-efficient, lower-emission vehicles for all people in our country. Texas is the biggest state not to have adopted these standards. And I think the auto makers will see the writing on the wall if we do so."" Any politico can appreciate why Republicans want to portray White as favoring ""socialized medicine"" and cap-and-trade legislation critics say would slam the state's economy.

"The Climatic Research Unit e-mails show that the science behind climate change ""has been pretty well debunked.""","The newest tool in climate skeptics' arsenal: a series of  hacked e-mails  from the Climatic Research Unit, a branch of the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom.

The correspondence, which was stolen from CRU's server sometime around Nov. 20, has some saying that the scientific underpinnings of climate change are false.

When asked on Dec. 7, 2009, about the Environmental Protection Agency's recent announcement that it will now consider carbon dioxide a pollutant, a move that clears the way for stricter regulations of the greenhouse gas, longtime climate change critic Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., had this to say on CNN's  The Situation Room  :

""We see that that science [behind the announcement] has been pretty well debunked,"" he said referring to the e-mails. ""I remember a long time ago ... I made a speech on the Senate floor where I talked about all these scientists coming in, talking about how they can't get their side on there and the science is all rigged. ... Sure enough, what is happening today in this whole debate is just what we said was happening four years ago.""

Specifically, Inhofe was talking about data that the EPA used to form its decision. It came from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a scientific body that ""reviews and assesses the most recent scientific, technical and socioeconomic information produced worldwide relevant to the understanding of climate change."" Thousands of scientists contribute data to the organization voluntarily, including scientists at CRU, the group whose e-mails were hacked.

We've been following the complicated e-mail controversy for weeks, but there have been a number of issues that make fact-checking claims about the issue difficult. To start, the e-mails were obtained illegally, which raises questions about their validity. Some e-mails simply demonstrate a professional rivalry between scientists, a phenomenon that's nothing new to the profession. Scientists are disputing the meaning of some of the language in the e-mails. Finally, CRU has announced that it is conducting its own investigation into whether data were tossed out or otherwise manipulated unethically; that investigation is not complete.

We do know that these e-mails clearly demonstrate some petty professional backstabbing and a degree of skepticism within the CRU circle about opinions that do not match their own.  Read our story on the e-mail controversy  .

We also know this: The e-mails do not prove that climate change is a hoax.

Here's why: Independent of CRU's data, agencies and academics all over the world are coming to essentially the same conclusion: Climate change is happening.

Just take a recent report issued by the  United States Global Research Program  , an arm of the government that, since 1989, has been coordinating and integrating federal research on changes in the global environment and their implications for society. The report states that ""global warming is unequivocal and primarily human-induced. ... Warming over this century is projected to be considerably greater than over the last century. The global average temperature since 1900 has risen by about 1.5ºF. By 2100, it is projected to rise another 2 to 11.5ºF.""

There are other ways to quantify these changes. NASA, for instance, tracks data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado at Boulder to see how temperatures are affecting the arctic. The most recent data show that 2009 marks the third-lowest Arctic sea ice minimum on record.

Similarly, data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration show that sea levels over the past 100 years are rising at an average rate of 1.7 millimeters annually, ""which is significantly larger than the rate averaged over the last several thousand years. Since 1993, global sea level has risen at an accelerating rate of around 3.5 mm/year. Much of the sea level rise to date is a result of increasing heat of the ocean causing it to expand.""

And here's an important point on NOAA's Web site:

""A number of agencies around the world have produced datasets of global-scale changes in surface temperature using different techniques to process the data and remove measurement errors that could lead to false interpretations of temperature trends,"" the Web site says. ""The warming trend that is apparent in all of the independent methods of calculating global temperature change is also confirmed by other independent observations, such as the melting of mountain glaciers on every continent, reductions in the extent of snow cover, earlier blooming of plants in spring, a shorter ice season on lakes and rivers, ocean heat content, reduced arctic sea ice, and rising sea levels.""

In short, temperatures are rising.

So, to say that the CRU e-mails debunk the science supporting climate change leaves out the important point that CRU isn't the only organization looking at the issue. Indeed, there are reams of data that show temperatures are increasing and that greater concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are largely to blame",False,"December 11, 2009"
"""President Obama's proposal calls for serious cuts in our own long-term carbon emissions,"" but China and India will still be allowed to increase their emissions.","On Day 2 of the climate talks in Copenhagen, Denmark, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin decided to weigh in.

Her op-ed, published in the Dec. 9, 2009, edition of the  Washington Post  , enumerated her concerns about a series of e-mails that skeptics say show disagreement over the seriousness of climate change and President Barack Obama's plan to pledge to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent below 2005 levels. We wrote  a separate story on the e-mails  . Here, we'll look at the emissions questions.

Palin argues that developing countries, like India and China, should at least be equal partners in the effort to slow global warming; it's unfair for the United States to shoulder the burden. ""Unlike the proposals China and India offered prior to Copenhagen -- which actually allow them to increase their emissions -- President Obama's proposal calls for serious cuts in our own long-term carbon emissions,"" she wrote.

Is that really what is happening? On Nov. 27, 2009, China announced it will lower emissions 40 to 45 percent below 2005 levels by 2020.

That may sound like a lot, but it's important to read the fine print here. China is talking about lowering carbon intensity. It's a measurement of how much energy it takes to produce a given amount of economic output. Climate experts say this means emissions from China will likely continue to grow along with its economy, but not as quickly as they would have otherwise.

""Let's say you commit to an intensity target of -6% per year in carbon/GDP,"" wrote climate scientist Jonathan Koomey, professor at Yale University’s School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. ""If your GDP grows at 10% per year, that means your carbon emissions will still grow 4% per year. So you're improving your carbon efficiency but absolute emissions are still increasing.""

Indeed, China's GDP is growing rapidly. In the third quarter of this year, it grew 8.9 percent, likely bringing the total annual growth to 8 percent.

On Dec. 4, India offered a similar proposal. Officials there say the country is prepared to cut carbon intensity from 20 to 25 percent by 2020. It's a landmark announcement for India; traditionally, the country has argued that it cannot afford to curb greenhouse gas emissions. But like China, India's economy is growing rapidly, and with it its carbon emissions.

Obama, on the other hand, is arguing for a cut large enough that the United States would see an absolute reduction in emissions, explained Koomey. (Obama's plan to trim emissions by 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 is part of a cap-and-trade change bill pending in the House of Representatives. A Senate bill would require a 20 percent cut.) Koomey, like many climate scientists, say overall cuts -- even from developing countries -- are necessary to really slow down climate change. While the United States' proposed cuts are more stringent than those proposed by China or India, they're less aggressive than the 25 to 50 percent emissions reduction scientists say countries must adopt to hold global average temperature increases to about 2 degrees Celsius.

So, where does that leave Palin's claim? She's correct that China and India's plans will allow them to increase emissions, while the United States would have to cut back",True,"December 11, 2009"
"The ""post-Soviet industrial meltdown is responsible for most of the progress in reducing carbon emissions that Europe is able to claim.""","This week, world leaders are meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark, to try to hammer out a global climate accord.
 
Washington Post  columnist Eugene Robinson had this to say about the upcoming summit in his Dec. 1, 2009, column:
 
""When the Copenhagen climate summit convenes next week, the European nations that have led the crusade against global warming will be able to report that the continent has met the targets for carbon-emission reductions set in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. There may be shoulder dislocations from all the self-congratulatory back-patting,"" Robinson wrote. ""But the Kyoto targets were well on the way toward being met before they were even established. The targets are based on 1990 emissions levels -- after the Soviet Union and the East Bloc had been fouling the air for years with their antiquated, carbon-spewing heavy industries. When the communist regimes -- and their creaky economies -- collapsed in a heap, emissions from the former Soviet-dominated zone fell by nearly 40 percent. ... This post-Soviet industrial meltdown is responsible for most of the progress in reducing carbon emissions that Europe is able to claim.""
 
Like Robinson, we expect the next 10 days to be full of complicated discussion about carbon emissions and reductions -- and a lot of boasting by the United States, Europe and other countries about all they're doing to slow climate change. So his claim about emissions reductions in former Soviet territory intrigued us.
 
But before we dig into this statement, a little background on the meeting in Copenhagen will be useful. It's arguably the most important climate gathering since 1997, when participating countries adopted the Kyoto Protocol in Kyoto, Japan. Collectively, 38 industrialized countries -- otherwise known as Annex B countries -- committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 5 percent below 1990 levels. At the time, 15 of those countries were members of the nascent European Union. The rest included Canada, Australia, and a handful of Eastern European countries recently liberated from the former Soviet Union; the protocol refers to these nations as ""economies in transition.""
 
The United States never ratified the treaty. In fact, according to data from the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Web site -- an international treaty written in 1992 meant to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations  -- our emissions have increased 17 percent over 1990 levels.
 
The protocol went into force in 2005, and it expires in 2012. So, world leaders are gathering in Copenhagen with the hope of laying the groundwork for the next round of emissions reductions. However, it's unclear what will actually be accomplished at the meeting. Congress has been  slow to act  on a  cap-and-trade bill  , which was initially considered the United States' strongest bargaining chip. And negotiations haven't been helped by news of hacked e-mails between climate scientists at Climate Research Unit that skeptics say  show disagreement  on the seriousness of global warming.
 
Historical data from the UNFCCC show that greenhouse gas emissions in Eastern Europe dropped dramatically after the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991. For example, Ukraine's annual carbon dioxide emissions dropped from 715 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 1990 to 426 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 1994.
 
All the experts we spoke with agreed this drop was due to the collapse of the Soviet Union. They also told us that a specific drop of ""nearly 40 percent"" was also in the ballpark. We asked Robinson, and he pointed us to  this post  on the Green Grok, a respected blog about environmental issues maintained by the Nicholas School of the Environment at Duke University, that includes a chart of emissions reductions derived from the most recent UNFCCC data. Indeed, in 2007, emissions from eastern European countries were still about 37 percent below 1990 levels, according to the blog.
 
They agreed that Robinson's second point -- that the ""post-Soviet industrial meltdown is responsible for most of the progress in reducing carbon emissions that Europe is able to claim"" -- has some truth to it. But they also told us that the story is more complicated than Robinson makes it seem.
 
Emissions in Europe have fallen for several reasons, said Michael Levi, director of the program on energy security and climate change for the Council on Foreign Relations. For example, during the 1990s, the United Kingdom switched from coal energy to natural gas, which helped trim emissions. And Europe's population has remained relatively flat.
 
But more importantly, Europe has had some pretty serious policies in place to reduce emissions, Levi said, including a carbon trading plan and incentives for alternative energy production.
 
""Overall, [Robinson's] point is correct, but it's overstated,"" he said.
 
Prasad Kasibhatla, associate professor at Nicholas School, agreed.

""The essence of the claim by Eugene Robinson is indeed correct,"" he wrote us in an e-mail. ""According to the latest year of reporting (2007), emission reductions in the EU-15 were driven largely by large reductions in Germany and the U.K. Part of the large reductions in Germany were driven by reunification with East Germany and part of the large reductions in the U.K. were driven by switch from coal to natural gas due to reforms of energy markets.""

Those variables paired with new climate change policies have reduced emissions in Western European countries by 4 percent, according to UNFCCC data.

In an e-mail, Robinson agreed that he may have glossed over that point.

""The EU countries did reduce emissions by 4 percent; I gave them credit for holding emissions down but perhaps not enough credit for the actual reduction.""

We also think it may have been more accurate for Robinson to clarify that the ""Europeans"" included the transitioning economies from the former Soviet bloc.

But Robinson argued that his overall point stands.

""The point I was trying to make, and I still believe it's valid, is that the Soviet bloc collapse created a huge, one-time fall-off in emissions that makes the numbers look better than they otherwise would against the Kyoto targets,"" he wrote.

With that point, we concur. Our experts tell us that it's widely understood that the fall of the Soviet Union meant major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. But they also said that Robinson glosses over important points in his statement, including that many European Union countries have taken key steps to slow climate change",Mostly True,"December 9, 2009"
"""The Congressional Budget Office -- supposedly non-partisan -- estimates that in just a few years the average cost to every family of four (from cap and trade) will be $6,800 per year.""","Critics of the Democratic cap-and-trade proposal have many complaints about the plan, but their biggest is cost. They say it will cost so much that it will be a significant burden on a typical American family.

The latest variation of this comes in a chain e-mail that contends the cap-and-trade plan will require more energy-efficient homes (a claim we rated  Pants on Fire  ). The e-mail says, ""The Congressional Budget Office -- supposedly non-partisan -- estimates that in just a few years the average cost to every family of four will be $6,800 per year. No one is excluded.""

We've spent a lot of time  looking into claims  about how much the cap-and-trade plan could cost families, and one thing's for certain: There's no consensus. The Environmental Protection Agency says it could cost as little as $80 per year while the conservative Heritage Foundation says it could cost as much as $1,241 annually in higher energy bills.

We've explained the pros and cons of the various estimates in those previous items, so here we're going to look into the chain e-mail's claim that the CBO estimates cap-and-trade will cost a family of four $6,800 a year.

The bill in question is called the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009. It is sponsored by Henry Waxman of California and Edward Markey of Massachusetts, and aims to reduce carbon emissions 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Companies, particularly utilities, would have to either buy pollution credits or adopt cleaner technology.

Critics say that either way, the cost of energy will go up, and that cost will be passed on to the consumer.

The CBO is a key player because it is a widely respected nonpartisan branch of Congress that calculates cost estimates. In June 2009, the CBO released an analysis of the House bill, saying that the economywide cost of the cap-and-trade program in 2020 would be $22 billion -- or about $175 per household. The individual cost would vary depending on your wealth. Low-income consumers could expect to save $40 a year because of credits from utilities, while high-income consumers would see a net cost for energy of $235 to $340 annually. It's also important to note that the costs are expected to vary year to year because of the way the law would be phased in. The CBO chose 2020 as a milestone for its analysis because it's a point at which the program would have been in effect for eight years, giving the economy and polluters time to adjust. But had the CBO chosen a later date, the cost per family may have been higher because the government would gradually be charging polluters more.

We traced the $6,800 estimate back to a report from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that has been very critical of the cap-and-trade plan. In the report, the group criticizes the CBO for failing to consider the harm that the cap-and-trade plan could do to the economy. The conservative group says the law could cause companies to produce less, which would reduce the GDP in 2020 by $161 billion in 2009 dollars. By 2035, it would be $650 billion lower, which works out to about $6,800 per family of four per year.

So the chain e-mail has taken the estimate from a conservative think tank and falsely attributed it to the CBO, a nonpartisan branch of Congress. There are many legitimate questions that can be raised about the cost of cap-and-trade, but it's simply incorrect to say the CBO came up with the $6,800 figure",False,"November 27, 2009"
"A cap-and-trade plan promoted by Barack Obama would hit hardest ""those already struggling to make ends meet.""","In her new book,  Going Rogue  , Sarah Palin says President Barack Obama's support for a cap-and-trade plan is ""misguided."" ""The president has already admitted that the policy he seeks will cause our electricity bills to 'skyrocket.' Sadly, those hit hardest will be those who are already struggling to make ends meet. So much for the campaign promise not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000 a year."" Before we examine her claim, here's a quick summary of cap and trade for those who aren't familiar with it: To slow climate change, the government would set a cap on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. To comply, companies such as electric utilities must either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits — also known as allowances — to continue polluting. Companies can buy and sell the credits as necessary to conduct their business. We were familiar with Barack Obama's original quote from his campaign for president. It came from a videotaped interview he did with the  San Francisco Chronicle  editorial board very early in the campaign in January 2008.

""Under my plan of a cap-and-trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket,"" Obama told the  Chronicle  . ""Coal-powered plants, you know, natural gas, you name it, whatever the plants were, whatever the industry was, they would have to retrofit their operations. That will cost money. They will pass that money on to consumers.""

(Separately, we rated Palin's statement on this comment  True  .) Ordinarily, higher electricty rates would hit hardest those ""already struggling to make ends meet,"" because it's awfully hard in this day and age to do without a basic level of electricity. But the actual legislation being considered in Congress now takes that into account, and includes measures intended to lower electricity rates for consumers. Reps. Henry Waxman and Edward Markey, Democrats from California and Massachusetts, respectively, wrote the bill that passed the House in June. Their goal is to lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Under their plan, most pollution permits initially would be given to companies for free. But eventually, they would have to buy those permits from the government. Under the bill, 30 to 40 percent of the revenues raised would go back to electric utilities to be passed on to consumers to offset higher rates they would have to pay. The money would be passed to consumers through rebates or expanded efficiency programs, and an additional 15 percent of the revenue would go directly to low-income consumers. So how much would rates go up for consumers? It's hard to say. There has been much debate about the costs, and it's been difficult to come up with a reliable number because the bills have been changing as they move through the House and the Senate. Republicans have cited numbers as high as $3,000 per year, a claim that when it was combined with a falsehood on health care, earned our  Pants on Fire  rating. Recent estimates by the Congressional Budget Office and the Environmental Protection Agency are much lower — between $80 and $340 a year, depending on income. But we do know that the bill seeks to offset those higher costs through rebates for low-income consumers. In fact, the poorest people might see a net benefit from cap and trade, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan, independent arm of Congress. It analyzed the effect on rates by household income in 2020 and found that the lowest 20 percent of households would see a net benefit of $40 per year. The next 20 percent of households would see an added cost of $40 per year. The middle 20 percent would pay $235 a year more; the second-highest 20 percent would pay $340 a year more, and the top 20 percent would pay $245 a year more. (The top tier does a little better because of credits for businesses.) The House bill is not the final version of cap and trade; the Senate still needs to consider its own bill. Palin is correct in that lower-income households would feel the impact of higher utility costs, but the House bill contains significant offsets to help people of modest means. Thanks to its offsets, the plan is not entirely regressive because the lowest one-fifth of households would see a net benefit",Half True,"November 17, 2009"

They will pass that money on to consumers.""

Obama also said the biggest challenge would be making sure voters understand why such a plan is necessary. ""The problem is, can you get the American people to say this is really important,"" Obama said. Obama was talking in general about cap and trade, but there is now a specific bill making its way through Congress, written by Reps. Henry Waxman and Edward Markey, Democrats from California and Massachusetts, respectively. Their goal is to lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050.

Legislators have opted to give 85 percent of the polluting permits away for free instead of putting them up for sale, as Obama pledged to do on the campaign trail. In theory, this approach should reduce costs to consumers. So how much would rates go up for consumers? It's hard to say.

"""For the last decade the climate has been cooling.""","Skeptics of climate change often say the world has been cooling in the past decade.

Conservative pundit Mary Matalin made that claim on CNN's  Situation Room  on Oct. 22, 2009. Matalin warned that the Obama administration is pushing too many big legislative initiatives such as a cap-and-trade plan to slow global warming when the administration should be focusing on the deficit.

""If they care about reducing the deficit, which should be their No. 1 priority ... they're not going to be able to do this — all this other nonsense, cap and trade and all the rest of it. Too much, too fast,"" Matalin said. ""Climate change is a fake issue anyway. ... There is not consensus science on what is causing global climate change. There is climate change, but for the last decade the climate has been cooling. There is the science. There is the data on that. They want to do this because they like to have all these programs being controlled by the government.""

So, Matalin acknowledges that the Earth's temperature is changing, but she's not so sure that those changes are man-made. We'll save the debate over whether climate change is caused by human activity for another day. For now, we're going to check Matalin's claim that the Earth has been cooling in recent years.

Last spring, we checked  a similar claim  made by the Cato Institute, a free-market think tank. The group claimed that there has been no net global warming for over a decade; we found that False because the climate scientists we spoke with said that, while temperatures have remained relatively static over the last decade, very little can be learned about climate change in a 10-year window.

Matalin's office sent us a few articles pertaining to the issue,  two   about  a new book by Christopher Booker, a British author and climate change skeptic, who wrote in the Oct. 25 issue of the British newspaper the  Telegraph  that, ""as the world has already been through two of its coldest winters for decades, with all the signs that we may now be entering a third, the scientific case for (carbon dioxide) threatening the world with warming has been crumbling away on an astonishing scale.""

Another study  , published by Bob Carter, a professor of geology at Australia's James Cook University, in the Jan. 20 issue of the  Australian  newspaper argued that ""global atmospheric temperature reached a peak in 1998, has not warmed since 1995 and, has been cooling since 2002.""

Carter is correct that global temperatures hit a high point in 1998. Several entities — including NASA, the Climate Research Unit in the United Kingdom and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States — track temperature changes. Generally speaking, their records show that 1998, a year when a warming pattern called El Nino ruled the weather, is the hottest we've had since scientists started collecting temperature information in the mid 1800s. NASA, on the other hand, pins 2005 as the hottest year on record.

But no matter how you slice the data, temperatures have indisputably fluctuated in the last decade, contrary to Matalin's suggestion that they have cooled.  This graph  from NASA shows that the temperature increased slightly between 2000 and 2001, dropped in 2002, and rose once again the following year. In this case, the annual mean temperature goes up and down, and the five-year mean is on a steady rise.  This graph  from NOAA shows a similar trend, with temperatures dipping slightly at the beginning of the decade and peaking once again in 2005.

We asked Richard Heim, a meteorologist at the NOAA National Climatic Data Center Climate Monitoring Branch, what to make of all these ups and downs.

At the most, it shows a plateau, he said. But certainly not a cooling trend.

""With climate change, not every year is going to be warmer,"" Heim said. ""It's two steps up, two steps down — that's not a indication we're on a massive cooling trend.""

NOAA climate monitoring chief Deke Arndt recently  told the Associated Press  the same thing:

""The last 10 years are the warmest 10-year period of the modern record,"" he said. ""Even if you analyze the trend during that 10 years, the trend is actually positive, which means warming.""

If 1998 is the starting point, a year many climate skeptics tend to cite, everything looks cooler in comparison, said Raymond Bradley, a climate scientist at the University of Massachusetts. He also pointed out that, when evaluating the impact of climate change on temperature, it's misleading to look at only the last 10 years.

A decade is such a small period of time that ""it's like saying, 'It was cold here last week. What happened to climate change?'"" Bradley said.

It's a point we heard repeatedly from the climate experts we interviewed. They all agreed that, while climate temperatures may dip from year to year, it's shortsighted to say changes within a decade mean that climate change is going away.

""If you just take a one-year comparison — say that it's cooler in 2008 than it was in 2007 — that's an improper use of statistics"" to make judgments about climate change, said John Reilly, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""It still remains much warmer than it was in the 1960s. To the extent that there has been some slight cooling, we still remain half-a-degree above what it was then.""

Indeed,  climate   records  show that temperatures have been on the rise since the middle of the century, and that fluctuations between recent years are relatively small compared to overall increase. NASA estimates that global temperatures have risen a total of 2.3 degrees since 1895, and that 13 of the warmest years since 1850 have occurred in the last 14 years.

Jim Hurrell, a senior scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., says these natural temperature variations are expected.

""In the same way that El Nino made 1998 warm, in 2007 and 2008, La Nina made global temperatures a bit cooler than they have been running, but still much warmer than the long-term average,"" Hurrell said referring to El Nino's cooler counterpart.

Citing just the last 10 years ""is a classic case of taking the data and letting it tell a very misleading story,"" he said.

Matalin said, ""for the last decade the climate has been cooling."" That suggests there has been a distinct reversal of the steady warming that scientists have documented for many years. But a review of the data shows that's not the case. The numbers show that in the past 10 years, global temperatures have not continued their sharp increase. But they have not cooled either. In fact, some years in the last decade have been hotter than the previous years. At most, they could be described as hitting a plateau. But they haven't cooled as Matalin said",False,"October 27, 2009"
"""Not only is there no scientific evidence that CO2 is a pollutant, higher CO2 concentrations actually help ecosystems support more plant and animal life.""","With Congress deep in a debate over legislation to slow climate change, the  Washington Post  has become a  popular place  for climate change claims, including this one from an organization called PlantsNeedCO2.org:
 
""Not only is there no scientific evidence that CO 2 is a pollutant, higher CO 2 concentrations actually help ecosystems support more plant and animal life,"" according to an ad the group published Oct. 5, 2009, in the  Post  .
 
To check this claim, we'll first need to travel back in time to high school biology, when we learned about a little life-sustaining process called photosynthesis. Plants pull carbon dioxide through tiny openings in their leaves where it combines with water and sunlight to create sugar and oxygen. Aside from maintaining normal oxygen levels in the atmosphere, life depends on photosynthesis as a source of energy.
 
Carbon dioxide also plays an important role in climate change. This is naturally occuring — we release it into the atmosphere every time we exhale — but is also emitted when we burn fossil fuels. Along with other greenhouse gases, such as methane and sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide traps energy from the sun in the atmosphere, which causes the Earth's surface temperatures to rise. Most scientists agree that greenhouse gases are primarily responsible for climate change.
 
PlantsNeedCO2.org  is skeptical. The organization, which is still awaiting its nonprofit status, is the brainchild of Leighton Steward, a self-described geologist, environmentalist, author and retired energy industry executive. He authored a diet book called  Sugar Busters!  and is the chairman of the board of the Institute for the Study of Earth and Man at Southern Methodist University. We sent an e-mail to the organization but our inquiry was not returned.
 
PlantsNeedCO2.org has one mission: ""to educate the public on the positive effects of additional atmospheric CO 2 and help prevent the inadvertent negative impact to human, plant and animal life if we reduce CO 2 .""
 
The Web site is chock-full of links to papers, videos and other evidence that more carbon dioxide is actually good for the environment.
 
""Far from being a pollutant, rising atmospheric CO 2 concentrations will never directly harm human health, but will indirectly benefit humans in a number of ways,"" according to the site. ""In addition to increasing the quantity of food available for human consumption, the rising atmospheric CO 2 concentration is also increasing the quality of the foods we eat.""
 
We're going to take the group's claims — that there is no scientific evidence that CO 2 is a pollutant and that higher CO 2 concentrations actually help ecosystems support more plant and animal life — one at a time.
 
First, PlantsNeedCO2.org claims that there is no scientific evidence that carbon dioxide is a pollutant.
 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency disagrees.
 
On April 17, 2009, the agency said that thorough scientific review proved that carbon dioxide, along with several other greenhouse gases, are pollutants that threaten human health; it is taking steps to regulate the gases under the Clean Air Act, a law typically reserved for monitoring traditional pollutants including ozone and sulfur dioxide.
 
""This finding confirms that greenhouse gas pollution is a serious problem now and for future generations,"" said EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson in a press release. ""In both magnitude and probability, climate change is an enormous problem. The greenhouse gases that are responsible for it endanger public health and welfare within the meaning of the Clean Air Act.'""
 
The EPA's findings were ""based on rigorous, peer-reviewed scientific analysis of six gases — carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride — that have been the subject of intensive analysis by scientists around the world. The science clearly shows that concentrations of these gases are at unprecedented levels as a result of human emissions, and these high levels are very likely the cause of the increase in average temperatures and other changes in our climate,"" according to the press release.
 
PlantsNeedCO2.org's second claim — that higher carbon dioxide concentrations boost plant and animal life — is not so clear-cut. To be sure, carbon dioxide is essential to life as we know it, and climate change skeptics have used the argument to reject efforts to reduce greenhouse gases.
 
""Plant physiologists have known for a long time that most vegetation loves more carbon dioxide,"" wrote Roy Spencer, a scientist at the University of Alabama at Huntsville in a 2008  National Review  article. ""It grows faster, is more drought-tolerant, and is more efficient in its water use. While the pre-industrial CO 2 concentration of the atmosphere was only about 280 parts per million (ppm) by volume, and now it is around 380 ppm, some greenhouses pump it all the way up to around 1,000 ppm. How can environmentalists claim that helping vegetation to grow is a bad thing?""
 
So, there's an argument to be made that carbon dioxide concentrations increase plant growth and abundance.
 
But the claim leaves out some important facts, said Rob Jackson, a professor of global environmental change and biology at Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment.
 
""Is carbon dioxide good for plants? The narrow answer is yes,"" said Jackson. ""But I think it's misleading to say that, if CO 2 is good for plants, it's good for the environment. ... It's kind of like saying that steroids are good for people — they build bone and muscle — but they also have other effects.""
 
For example, Jackson's research shows that with higher carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere we would see more wood growth, but that there may also be more pests due to higher temperatures, and longer droughts due to more evaporation.
 
Beyond the  reams  of  scientific research  to demonstrate how dramatically the Earth could change with increased carbon dioxide levels, some studies indicate that more is not necessarily better for plants. For instance, a two-decade study of the Panama and Malaysia rainforests demonstrated that temperature increases of more than 1 degree could lead to 50 percent reduction in tree growth.
 
A study launched in 1997 in California studied the effects of climate change on grasslands. Scientists doubled atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, raised the temperature by 2 degrees, increased precipitation by 50 percent, and raised levels of nitrogen, which is also a product of fossil fuel consumption, to simulate how the Earth might look decades from now. When carbon dioxide levels alone were raised, plants grew quite a bit.
 
""But when we factored in realistic treatments — warming, changes in nitrogen deposition, changes in precipitation — growth was actually suppressed,"" Christopher B. Field, a professor at Stanford, told ScienceDaily in 2002.
 
But back to PlantsNeedCO2.org's claim. They are wrong that carbon dioxide is not considered a pollutant. According to the EPA, it is. And the claim that ""higher CO 2 concentrations actually help ecosystems support more plant and animal life"" leaves out some important details. While carbon dioxide is good for plants, increased amounts of it in our atmosphere will have auxiliary effects that are decidedly bad for ecosystems. For PlantsNeedCO2",False,"October 7, 2009"
"The cap-and-trade bill will mean ""2 million jobs lost.""","EnergyCitizens.org  has a new complaint about the cap-and-trade bill: It's a job killer.
 
In an Oct. 4, 2009, ad in the  Washington Post  , the group said that ""2 million jobs lost"" is ""another unfortunate truth about Congress's climate bill.""

The organization, which includes business associations, antitax groups, transportation companies and the American Petroleum Institute, has ramped up criticism of the sweeping cap-and-trade bill since the Senate took up its own version of the legislation in late September. The House has already passed its version of the bill; it aims to lower carbon pollution 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050 by capping carbon emissions and requiring firms to buy credits, either from the government or from other companies, to continue polluting.
 
Opponents of cap-and-trade argue that forcing industry to buy pollution credits will ultimately harm consumers and business. They argue that phasing out fossil fuels will require big job cuts and many employment opportunities will be sent overseas.
 
EnergyCitizens.org is among the critics.
 
The group's ad cites a May 27 study of the House bill written for the National Black Chamber of Commerce, which opposes the bill, by private consulting firm CRA International. The study predicts that net job losses could be as high as 2.5 million by 2030 and 3 million in 2050.
 
CRA International does not dispute the fact that cap-and-trade would create new jobs. But, ""despite the promise of green jobs, ACESA would, if enacted, inevitably depress total employment from baseline levels. The bill would divert resources now used to produce additional goods and services into the work of obtaining energy from sources that are more costly than fossil fuels.""  That outlook doesn't square with what we've been hearing from lawmakers who support a cap-and-trade plan. The backers of the House version say the legislation would create ""millions of new clean-energy jobs.""

The authors of the Senate version say, ""This bill includes targeted protection for our manufacturing sector to ensure that American companies remain competitive and jobs remain here at home. New programs will train workers to succeed in the new energy economy. Agriculture and rural America will see a boom in investments in biofuels and alternative energy sources.""
 
Both bills include funding for worker training and expanded unemployment benefits; for example, the House bill would provide 156 weeks of benefits, helping to pay for health insurance, job training and employment search assistance  to those who lose their jobs  as the result of cap-and-trade.
 
But neither House nor Senate lawmakers working on the legislation have pinned down exactly how many jobs their bills would eliminate and create, so we decided to look at other estimates.
 
The Center for American Progress, another liberal group, says the bill could create a net increase of about 1.7 million jobs so long as $150 billion is dedicated to the clean-energy industry every year.
 
""These job gains would be enough — on their own — to reduce the unemployment rate in today’s economy by about one full percentage point, to 8.4 percent from current 9.4 percent levels — even after taking into full account the inevitable job losses in conventional fossil fuel sectors of the U.S. economy as they contract,"" according to the June 2009 report.
 
And a second analysis done by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a group that is supporting the bill, estimates that the cap-and-trade bill could create anywhere between 600,000 and 1 million new jobs by 2030.
 
Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office issued a report in September 2009 that the cap-and-trade plan would have a minor effect on employment in the long-run.
 
""The small effect on overall employment would mask a significant shift in the composition of employment over time,"" according to the report. ""A cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide emissions would reduce the number of jobs in industries that produce carbon-based energy, use energy intensively in their production processes, or produce products whose use involves energy consumption, because those industries would experience the greatest increases in costs and declines in sales."" But ""the shifts in demand caused by the policy would also create new employment opportunities in some industries.""

Stephen Seidel, vice president for policy analysis and general counsel at the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said, ""Estimating jobs is a very difficult task for the limited modeling tools that we have."" Jobs will almost certainly be lost and created under a cap-and-trade program, it's just a matter to what degree, he said. The CRA International report used in the EnergyCitizens.org ad ""falls on the high end.""

So, back to EnergyCitizens.org's claim that 2 million jobs will be lost under cap-and-trade. As we've shown, the job predictions are all over the map. Supporters of cap-and-trade predict an increase. CRA, which was hired by an opponent of the proposal, says jobs will be lost. The independent CBO characterizes it as a wash.

Of all these groups, we're inclined to believe the CBO, since it is independent. But we can't rule out the possibility that there could be gains or losses on either end, as the predictions aligned with supporters and opponents suggest",True,"October 5, 2009"
Gas will reach $4 a gallon under a cap-and-trade plan.,"In a full-page ad in the Sept. 30, 2009, edition of the  Washington Post  , was this eye-catching claim about gas prices:
 
""$4 GAS - Another unfortunate truth about the House's climate bill,"" said the ad from  EnergyCitizens.org  . ""As Congress considers new climate legislation, Americans aren't getting the whole truth. A recent study found the House-passed bill could lead to $4 per-gallon gasoline. America is in the middle of a harsh recession. Think about the impact of $4 gas.""
 
We've heard a lot about the cap-and-trade plan — that it  will increase   the cost   of energy  and that it will  eliminate jobs  — but it's been a while since we put  claims about the price of gas  to the Truth-O-Meter.
 
The concept of cap-and-trade is relatively easy to understand. A cap is put on greenhouse gas emissions, and firms are required to buy credits, either from the government or from other companies, to continue polluting. Iterations of a cap-and-trade plan have been introduced in Congress previously, but the most recent legislation, written by Democrats Henry Waxman of California and Ed Markey of Massachusetts, has been passed by the House of Representatives. Their bill aims to lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Under their plan, most pollution permits initially would be given out free. But eventually, companies would have to buy those permits from the government.
 
Opponents of cap-and-trade argue that forcing industry to buy pollution credits will ultimately harm consumers and business. Firms will have no choice but to pass on the cost of buying those permits. And that's where the argument from EnergyCitizens.org comes into play. The group, a coalition of business organizations, antitax groups, transportation companies, and Washington heavy hitters such as the American Petroleum Institute and the American Farm Bureau Federation, says those higher prices will hit consumers in the form of higher gas prices.
 
The ad cites a Heritage Foundation study of the bill published on June 16. The conservative think tank, which has been critical of the Waxman-Markey bill, contends higher energy prices ""will spread throughout the economy as producers everywhere try to cover their higher production costs by raising their product prices. ... Even after adjusting for inflation, gasoline prices will rise 58 percent over the 2035 baseline price.""
 
We checked with the Heritage Foundation to find out if EnergyCitizens.org was correctly interpreting Heritage's study, and were told that the group was. Heritage also pointed us to another study the think tank did that looked at gas prices per state. Heritage assumes that under Waxman-Markey, gas will be at a minimum $3 a gallon in 2035, depending on where you live. A 58 percent price increase as a result of cap-and-trade would put the cost of a gallon of gasoline at more that $4.
 
So, based on Heritage's data and assumptions, EnergyCitizens.org is in the ballpark. However, the group leaves out an important detail in its ad: These predictions are for 2035, 26 years from now when, presumably, our economic landscape will be very different. EnergyCitizens.org plays on people's anxiety about the recession by portraying these prices as something that would take effect immediately.
 
To get more perspective, we looked at other estimates. For comparison, keep in mind that the current national average is $2.60 for unleaded regular.
 
The Energy Information Administration, a branch of the Energy Department, published an analysis of the bill on Aug. 4, 2009, which predicts gas price increases will be relatively small compared to increases in the electricity sector, in part because emissions reductions from the fossil-fuel sector will only account for 12 to 20 percent of overall reductions. If the bill is enacted, gas prices will only be about 20 cents more per gallon in 2020 and 35 cents more in 2030, the report predicts.
 
Another analysis by the Environmental Protection Agency predicts impacts on future gas prices would be minimal under the Waxman-Markey bill. Specifically, prices would go up $0.13 in 2015, $0.25 in 2030, and $0.69 in 2050, according to the June 23 report.
 
Clearly, there's a difference of opinion on how much the price of gas will change as the result of cap-and-trade. For the most part, those differences have to do with what kind of assumptions are made about nonfossil fuels, such as nuclear and wind power. The EPA, for example, assumes that cleaner technologies and renewable energy will replace fossil fuel more quickly, which would translate to lower costs to consumers. Heritage takes an austere approach, assuming that traditional energy sources would be scaled back to meet new emissions standards, but would not be immediately replaced by new technology or renewable fuels. As a result, fossil fuel prices will go up and continue to rise.
 
Another point to put this all in perspective: Gas prices fluctuate dramatically. In January 2009, a gallon of gas cost about a $1.80 a gallon. This week, gas costs $2.60 — about a $1.20 less than it was a year ago. So predicting how much gas will cost next week — let alone in 2035 — is an imperfect science.

Based on the estimates, it's probably a safe bet that the price of gasoline will ultimately increase as a result of cap-and-trade. And the estimates vary based on reasonable disagreements about methodology. But Energycitizens.org is guilty of a significant exaggeration because the ad strongly implies the price hike would happen very soon. It fails to mention that $4-a-gallon gasoline wouldn't be the norm until 2035 — if it ever is. The group also leaves out other important studies that predict smaller increases",True,"September 30, 2009"
"The Obama administration's cap-and-trade plan would create ""a $1,761 yearly energy tax.""","It's hard to keep track of all those estimates about how much a cap-and-trade bill would cost American families. So, the latest prediction, coming from Sen. Lamar Alexander and other Republicans, is just adding to the confusion.
 
In a Sept. 16, 2009, press release, the Tennessean said, ""American families can’t afford a new $1,761 yearly energy tax.""
 
Similar numbers were widely posted on conservative blogs. A story on the  Weekly Standard  was headlined, ""Obama Admin Concedes: Cap and Trade Will Raise Your Taxes by 15%.""

Those were new numbers to us, so we decided to look into the claim.
 
But first, a little recap. At its heart, cap-and-trade is a simple concept: To slow climate change, the government would set a cap on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. To comply, companies such as electric utilities must either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits — also known as allowances — to continue polluting.
 
The cap-and-trade bill currently making its way through Congress was written by Reps. Henry Waxman and Edward Markey, Democrats from California and Massachusetts, respectively. Their goal is to lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Under their plan, most pollution permits initially would be given out for free. But eventually, companies would have to buy those permits from the government. It's an issue we've explored  several   times   over  .
 
Opponents of cap-and-trade argue that forcing industry to buy pollution credits is nothing more than a tax on consumers and business. Firms will have no choice but to pass the cost of buying those permits on to consumers. There has been much debate about how much those costs could be, and it's been difficult to come up with a reliable number because the bills have been changing as they move through the House and the Senate. Republicans have cited numbers as high as $3,000 per year, a claim that when it was combined with a falsehood on health care, earned our Pants on Fire rating. Republicans often refer to it as a tax, although we have found that is incorrect. Only utilities that exceed their limits would have to pay for the allowances, which does not sound to us like a tax on families. Recent estimates by the Congressional Budget Office and the Environmental Protection Agency are much lower — between $80 and $340 a year, depending on income.
 
The new numbers spring from some Treasury Department documents recently acquired by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, through a Freedom of Information Act request. Some of the documents are from 2008, shortly after the election, according to the group, and others are undated, though they appear to be from early 2009.
 
Nowhere in the documents does the Treasury Department cite the $1,761 figure. It seems Alexander got that number from a Sept. 15, 2009, story by Declan McCullagh, a blogger who writes the ""Taking Liberties"" column for CBS News. (Our calls to Alexander's office were not returned.) So it's worth noting that Alexander is relying not on a study by an economist, but on an estimate from a blogger.
 
""The Obama administration has privately concluded that a cap and trade law would cost American taxpayers up to $200 billion a year, the equivalent of hiking personal income taxes by about 15 percent,"" McCullagh wrote. ""A previously unreleased analysis prepared by the U.S. Department of Treasury says the total in new taxes would be between $100 billion to $200 billion a year. At the upper end of the administration's estimate, the cost per American household would be an extra $1,761 a year.""
 
We contacted McCullagh via e-mail, and he told us that he came up with $1,761 per household annually by simply dividing the number $200 billion by the number of households in the United States. According to the census, there are about 113.5 million households in the country this year.
 
We reviewed the estimate with people involved in the climate change debate who told us there are significant flaws in McCullagh's methodology. Stephen Seidel, vice president for policy analysis and general counsel for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said the math is too simple and doesn't reflect the true impact of the House bill, which specifies that any revenue from the plan be rebated to consumers to offset higher electrical bills they might have to pay. ""What [Treasury] was looking at was a situation where 100 percent of the permits were auctioned, and ignored what would be done with revenue,"" he said. The Waxman-Markey bill ""uses revenue to offset cost to consumers.""
 
There also have been changes to the bill since that Treasury document was created. Obama originally envisioned that every polluting permit would be sold, starting when the bill was enacted. But in the spirit of compromise, Waxman and Markey scaled back that plan by giving about 85 percent of the permits for free in the early years of the bill's implementation.

Also, under the latest version of the Waxman-Markey bill, which passed the House in June, 30 to 40 percent of the revenue would go back to electric utilities to be passed on to consumers to offset higher rates they would have to pay. The money would be passed to consumers through rebates or expanded efficiency programs, and an additional 15 percent of the revenue would go directly to low-income consumers.

""The bottom line is that it goes back to the consumers,"" Seidel said.
 
Seidel said there's another problem with the blogger's report, as quoted by the senator: the Treasury documents report that $100 billion to $200 billion in revenue raised each year by selling those pollution permits we mentioned earlier. Alexander and McCullagh incorrectly portray them as taxes. There are legitimate questions that can be raised about how much the cost might ultimately be passed on to consumers, but it is not correct to refer to the revenue as a tax.

And higher energy costs are not a sure thing. Regional cap-and-trade programs in Europe and in the northeast United States show that auctioning most or all credits have actually decreased the cost of energy, said Barry Rabe, a public policy professor at the University of Michigan.
 
""What we've seen is that there's a lot of volatility,"" he said. ""It's hard to make those projections and say how these things are going to work as a result. That just underscores the difficulty of attaching numbers to these things that people can live with.""

Alan Krueger, the Obama administration's assistant treasury secretary for economic policy, sent us this statement via e-mail:
 
""The reporting on the Treasury memo is flat-out wrong,"" he wrote. ""Treasury's summary is consistent with public analyses by the EIA [Energy Information Administration], EPA, and CBO, and the reporting and blogging on this issue ignore the fact that the revenue raised from emission permits would be returned to consumers under both administration and legislative proposals.""
 
We spoke with Christopher Horner with the Competitive Enterprise Institute about the documents. He conceded that they don't reflect legislation currently under consideration, but he pointed out that the Senate is planning to start from scratch on the climate issue.
 
""Congress writes legislation for one reason,"" Horner said. ""This [document] sets forth the administration's desire and expectations.""
 
In the meantime, McCullagh has been  fielding criticism  about his column. On Sept. 16 he defended his analysis and wrote that revenue returned to consumers in the form of tax cuts and rebates is uncertain.
 
""The tax revenue might end up being directed at income tax cuts (or rescuing kittens and feeding orphans, for that matter), or it could end up being wasted on boondoggles,"" he wrote. ""If it is returned to American citizens, it's unlikely to be a wash: some people will end up paying much more in taxes, some will pay a little more, and some will see a net benefit.""
 
But back to Alexander's original claim. His statement that households will pay $1,761 in new taxes every year is based on a blogger's incorrect assumptions and overly simple math. The estimate does not account for revenue that will be returned to consumers in the form of rebates and other efficiency measures. Furthermore, the number is based on old numbers; the Treasury estimate was written on the premise that all permits would be sold, which, ultimately, is not the form that the Waxman-Markey legislation has taken. Finally, both Alexander and McCullagh portray money raised by selling these permits as a tax",False,"September 18, 2009"
"""Cap-and-trade is wildly unpopular with Americans.""","The editorial board of  Investor's Business Daily  says the supporters of a cap-and-trade bill face an uphill battle. 
 
In a Sept. 2, 2009, op-ed about the European stake in a climate change bill passed by the House of Representatives, the editors wrote, ""Cap-and-trade is wildly unpopular with Americans. No matter how many suave European continentals you send here, it won't change voters' minds.""
 
To support their claim, the board included a June 28-29 Rasmussen poll that shows that 56 percent of Americans said they wouldn't pay more taxes to cut greenhouse gases. The question — and the op-ed — leave out the important fact that the bill doesn't impose new taxes (though it's likely people would see higher utility bills as the result of cap-and-trade, which would raise the cost of energy at least slightly).
 
But the claim piqued our interest nevertheless, so we decided to check other polls to see how the plan is playing among voters.
 
The background: Cap-and-trade is a way to slow climate change by reducing carbon emissions. The idea is to cap emissions and require firms to either buy polluting permits or upgrade to cleaner technologies. House lawmakers included such a plan in a bill passed on June 26 that will lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050.
 
So let's look at how much support it has. A  Washington Post  /ABC News survey published on June 25, a day before the bill was passed, showed that 75 percent of Americans think the government should regulate greenhouse gas emissions to reduce global warming. About 52 percent support a cap-and-trade program to accomplish that. Opposition has grown to 42 percent, up from 34 percent in the summer of 2008.
 
The same pollsters did a follow-up survey Aug. 13-17 and found that support for cap-and-trade was unchanged. This time, however, the poll provided more detail. About 58 percent said they would support the idea if it raised monthly electric bills by 10 dollars. But when that cost went up to 25 dollars, support dropped to 39 percent.
 
(We've already explored different opinions on how much the legislation might cost, and you can read about them  here  .)
 
Meanwhile, a Zogby poll published on Aug. 11 found that 71 percent of Americans support the legislation that was passed in the House.
 
It's worth noting that all those numbers are up from polls that were taken earlier in the year, before the bill was debated and passed in the House. For example, in April, a Zogby poll found that 30 percent of respondents supported cap-and-trade. And a CNN poll done one month later found that 44 percent favor a cap-and-trade plan. 
 
So, given the most recent polling, it would be fair to say that a slight majority of Americans support cap-and-trade but that those numbers may decrease depending on how much it would cost in higher utility bills. Even so, at its lowest, nearly 40 percent of Americans would still support cap-and-trade even if it meant heftier energy bills",False,"September 3, 2009"
"""Scientists project that the Arctic will be ice-free in the summer of 2013.""","Sen. John Kerry says climate change is happening faster than we think.
 
In an Aug. 31, 2009, op-ed in the Huffington Post, the Massachusetts Democrat wrote that the threat of climate change ""is not an abstract concern for the future.""
 
""It is already upon us and its effects are being felt worldwide, right now,"" he wrote. ""Scientists project that the Arctic will be ice-free in the summer of 2013. Not in 2050, but four years from now. Make no mistake: catastrophic climate change represents a threat to human security, global stability, and — yes — even to American national security.""
 
We don't debate that the effects of climate change are already being felt. However, Kerry's claim that the Arctic will be ice-free in as little as five years is ominous and worth putting to the Truth-O-Meter.

Arctic ice has long been considered a canary in a coal mine for climate scientists; they watch it closely because significant melts indicate an acceleration of climate change effects. In fact, temperatures actually rise faster in icy regions because of something known as ice albedo feedback loop. Ice is more reflective than land or water. When ice melts, the reflectivity of the Earth's surface decreases as well, and more solar radiation is absorbed by the land and the oceans. So, as ice melts, more and more heat from the sun is absorbed, accelerating the warming process.

Melting has recently become a more serious problem, and 2007 was a particularly bad year for the Arctic. Then, about 552 billion tons of ice melted from Greenland's ice sheet during the summer — about 15 percent more than the summer average.

The summer of 2009 didn't look much better. According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, the average rate of melt in July of this year is nearly identical to that of July 2007, in part due to unusual weather patterns and an underlying trend toward higher temperatures.

But does this mean ice will be completely gone in the next few years? We talked to Julienne Stroeve, a researcher for the NSIDC, for some perspective.

Climate scientists ""agree that we'll lose summer ice cover,"" she said. ""As to the exact date, it varies between groups."" The summer ice cover is what's left of the sea ice after the annual seasonal melting. It refreezes when temperatures drop. Indeed, predictions are all over the map. Kerry got his data from Wieslaw Maslowski, a researcher from the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif., who as early as 2007 predicted the Arctic would be ice-free by the summer of 2013. Similar projections have been trumpeted by a handful of other scientists, including Warwick Vincent, director of the Center for Northern Studies at Laval University in Quebec and NASA climate scientist Jay Zwally. (A Kerry spokeswoman directed us to this 2007  article  about Maslowski's work.)

Meanwhile, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations group relying on the consensus of hundreds of climate scientists, estimated in 2007 that summer ice would largely be gone in the latter part of the 21st century; and Stroeve said NSIDC supports a prediction of 2030.

NASA climate researcher Gavin Schmidt wrote in an e-mail to us that Maslowski's prediction isn't necessarily a communitywide opinion.

""A fair statement would be that some scientists have predicted summer ice free Arctic Ocean as soon as 2013, but others expect it to happen a little slower — say 2040-2060,"" Schmidt wrote.

Differences occur when research focuses on the area of the Arctic — based on aerial satellite photographs — or on thickness and volume of the ice as well as area, according to Maslowski. In both cases, scientists have seen melting, Maslowski said. However, when estimates are based on the latter method, as Maslowski and his team of researchers have done, melting seems to be happening much faster.

""There is no crystal ball, there is no final prediction, just estimates,"" Maslowski said. ""All we are trying to show is that we better start thinking [ice-free summers] could start earlier than 2100 or 2030. We should be prepared for the worst-case scenario.""

Kerry's claim also leaves out an important nuance; as Stroeve said, most climate scientists agree that  summer  ice is likely to disappear at some point, but that the oceans will still freeze in the winter for a very long time. However, Kerry's op-ed could make it sound as if the Arctic will devoid of ice all year long.

As always with the climate change debate, we've found that there's a wide range of informed opinion on the issue of Arctic melting. In a general sense, Kerry is correct that Arctic ice is melting at a quickening rate. However, he has based his prediction on the earliest and most extreme estimate, when a much wider range of estimates are available and most project the turning point will occur decades from now. And he makes it seem as if the Arctic will be totally ice-free within a few short years when in fact that would only be true for the summer",True,"September 2, 2009"
"""Job losses are so certain under this new cap-and-tax plan that it includes a provision accommodating newly unemployed workers from the resulting dried-up energy sector, to the tune of $4.2 billion over eight years. So much for creating jobs.""","Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has been making waves in the blogosphere with a recent op-ed on cap-and-trade.
 
Her critics say Palin's July 14, 2009, piece in the  Washington Post  gets it all wrong. It ""displays an ignorance for the subject so profound it's almost gutsy,"" Conor Clarke wrote in the  Atlantic  .  Keith Olberman said on  Countdown  that she uses ""the sky-is-falling tactics.""
 
We've explored other aspects of the cap-and-trade bill before, including  how much it would cost  lower-income consumers (Palin says it would hit them hardest, but the independent Congressional Budget Office predicts it would actually put money in the pockets of the poorest), as well as  how much of an impact  the bill would really have on climate.
 
Today, we're tackling this claim from Palin's op-ed: ""Job losses are so certain under this new cap-and-tax plan that it includes a provision accommodating newly unemployed workers from the resulting dried-up energy sector, to the tune of $4.2 billion over eight years. So much for creating jobs.""
 
Before we dig into Palin's statement, here's a quick summary of how the cap-and-trade bill, authored by Reps. Henry Waxman of California and Edward Markey of Massachusetts, would work. The bill aims to slow climate change by lowering carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. To do that, the bill would cap yearly carbon emissions, and to comply, companies will have to either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits to continue polluting. Initially, the government's permits for polluters would be given out for free. But eventually, companies would have to buy those permits from the government.

Palin and other Republicans say they are concerned that the transition will be costly to industry — particularly companies in the energy sector — and that workers will lose their jobs as a result.
 
The authors of the bill are also concerned — so much so that they included the program Palin refers to. Should workers lose their jobs, they would get 156 weeks of benefits, including 70 percent of their average weekly wage, help paying for health insurance, job training and employment search assistance.
 
So, Palin is correct that the bill has a program for displaced workers.

Funding for the program would come from selling those pollution allowances we mentioned earlier.

Supporters of cap-and-trade argue that Palin's statement is misleading because she makes it seem like, overall, the bill is killing jobs. They say she neglects to point out that it will add thousands of jobs in industries that will grow because of the dramatic policy change. Bracken Hendricks, a senior fellow with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, recently predicted the bill would create 1.7 million new jobs. The program Palin's talking about will also help train those workers to participate in the emerging industry.
 
""In an economic shift from pollution to clean energy, some sectors will see impacts,"" he said. ""But this policy isn't about job loss, it's about anticipated growth. ... The expectation is that there will be a net job creation.""
 
So, back to Palin's claim. She's correct that there is a program in the bill that would help displaced workers, but she paints a narrow view of how the bill will affect employment. Yes, some workers will be displaced and need to be retrained, but some experts are projecting growth and new jobs in industries that benefit from the new policy",Mostly True,"July 16, 2009"
"""If the United States moves ahead by itself (on cap-and-trade)... after 30 or 40 years, we're going to reduce CO2 by less than 1 percent.""","Shortly after the House of Representatives passed a cap-and-trade bill, some Republicans made this claim about the plan: Lowering carbon emissions in the United States will do little to slow climate change unless other countries do the same.

The GOP's position is that putting a cap on carbon dioxide emissions will be too costly for businesses and for consumers, and if the United States is going it alone those costs outweigh the environmental benefit.

Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, who has been one of the more vocal skeptics, made this argument on June 28, 2009, on  This Week with George Stephanopoulos. 

""If the United States moves ahead by itself (on cap-and-trade) ... after 30 or 40 years, we're going to reduce CO2 by less than 1 percent,"" he said.

He reiterated his opinion during a conference call with reporters on July 1, 2009, saying, ""If the United States would go ahead — because we're supposed to so-called set an example for the rest of the world — and if the rest of the world doesn't go along, then we're turning out to be suckers because we're — we're going to just reduce total CO2 by a spit in the ocean by ourselves.""

We wondered whether our cap-and-trade plan could be as limited as Grassley maintains — or at least whether Grassley's 1 percent prediction is even close.

Before digging into his claim, here's a little background on this complicated issue, one we've  already   explored  in terms of how much it  might cost  consumers. The bill, authored by Democratic Reps. Henry Waxman of California and Edward Markey of Massachusetts, was approved by the House of Representatives on June 26, and would essentially limit the amount of carbon dioxide companies can emit each year. The cap will become tighter and tighter over time, and ultimately, lawmakers say their plan will reduce carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020, and 83 percent by 2050.

Of course, those big reductions apply only to carbon emissions produced in the United States. Cap-and-trade opponents say it's foolhardy for the United States to move forward without some indication that other countries will adopt similar restrictions. But the European Union already has agreed to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020. And in July, members of the Group of Eight are expected to hammer out a deal on global emissions reductions.

Of greatest concern remains China, a country that has recently become the world's biggest producer of greenhouse gases. According to the Energy Information Administration, a government-run database of energy statistics, the United States contributed about 5,907 million metric tons in 2006 — or about 20 percent of the world's total. In the same year, China surpassed that amount by about 100 million metric tons, becoming the leading contributor to global warming.

New York Times  columnist Paul Krugman pointed out exactly this problem in a May 14 op-ed about China's economic development.

""China cannot continue along its current path because the planet can’t handle the strain,"" he wrote. ""The scientific consensus on prospects for global warming has become much more pessimistic over the last few years. Indeed, the latest projections from reputable climate scientists border on the apocalyptic. Why? Because the rate at which greenhouse gas emissions are rising is matching or exceeding the worst-case scenarios. And the growth of emissions from China — already the world’s largest producer of carbon dioxide — is one main reason for this new pessimism.""

The Pew Center on Global Climate Change, an organization that produces analysis on climate issues, had this to say: ""Climate change is a global problem and will require nations of the world to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It is true that the United States has recently been overtaken by China as the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, but the United States still contributes 20 percent of global emissions, so what we do is critically important. It is also true that if the United States acts alone, we cannot solve climate change.""

And Harvard economics professor Martin Feldstein offered some numbers to back up a similar opinion:

""Since the U.S. share of global CO2 production is now less than 25 percent (and is projected to decline as China and other developing nations grow), a 15 percent fall in U.S. CO2 output would lower global CO2 output by less than 4 percent,"" he wrote in a June 1  Washington Post  op-ed. ""Its impact on global warming would be virtually unnoticeable. The U.S. should wait until there is a global agreement on CO2 that includes China and India before committing to costly reductions in the United States.""

Less than 4 percent is close to what Grassley said, but we wanted to see some real data. So, we turned to a memo produced by two professors at Duke University's Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions who concluded that, ""the success of (Waxman-Markey) depends on whether other nations also pursue equivalent reductions.""

To illustrate their point, professors Tim Profeta and Prasad Kasibhatla plotted three possible scenarios using this handy  modeling system  (yes, you can  play along  , too). In the first, most developed countries — including the United States and some European nations — adopt something similar to Waxman-Markey, but developing countries do not; in the second, developing nations reduce emissions as well; and in the third, developing nations delay a reduction in their emissions, but eventually participate.

Their work shows that, under the first scenario, there would actually be a steady increase in carbon emissions, while under the other two scenarios — where developed countries pitch in — carbon emissions would decline over time.

So, Grassley's prediction is right — sort of, said Profeta.

""It's true that if the U.S. acts solo, we will see little impact,"" he said, adding that he's not sure where Grassley got his ""1 percent"" prediction. ""But that's a very unlikely assumption.""

We're more likely to see something along the lines of scenario three, he said, where China will adopt cap-and-trade at a later date, when its per capita carbon emissions equal those from developed countries.

We posed a similar question to Mark Radka with the United Nations Environment Program via e-mail.

""With no one else doing anything other than growing — a lot — and the U.S. singlehandedly reducing emissions along a not so aggressive path you might come up with a number like 1 percent,"" he wrote.  ""This would be one of those absurd baseline scenarios that really doesn’t represent a baseline in any other than a theoretical sense.""

And Alden Meyer with the Union of Concerned Scientists said it's a myth that China's doing nothing, pointing out that the country has embraced renewable technologies and set fuel economy standards that are arguably more stringent than those  announced  by the Obama administration earlier this year. ""You could say it's a drop in the bucket, but that could be said for any country,"" Meyer added. ""The risk of not adopting Waxman-Markey is that we give China the excuse to say, 'Why should we do it if the wealthiest country isn't doing it?'"" So where does that leave us? The experts we spoke with all agree that our impact on climate change will be relatively small without the involvement of other countries, particularly China. On this point, Grassley is correct. But, those same experts say it's highly unlikely that we would be the only nation limiting our carbon emissions in the coming decades. In fact, Grassley's statement is misleading in this regard because Europe already has adopted stricter goals than the targets we're considering, and China is taking other steps to reduce carbon production. As for Grassley's prediction that our cap-and-trade bill alone would only reduce climate change emissions by 1 percent, things are still murky. His office did not return calls or e-mails to back up that claim, our experts had never heard the statistic before, nor could we find any studies or documents to support it. The only number we've got comes from an opinion article written by a Harvard economist, who says 4 percent, which is in the Grassley ballpark",Half True,"July 2, 2009"
"Contends that President Obama ""literally said (if) his cap-and-trade proposals were to pass, that utility rates, his words now, would, 'necessarily skyrocket.'""","With Congress debating a cap-and-trade plan to reduce global warming, House Republicans are touting an alternative that they say will be less expensive.

Instead of regulating carbon dioxide by forcing power companies to buy and trade polluting credits, why not subsidize renewable fuel production and build new nuclear reactors, posited GOP Congressman Mike Pence on MSNBC's  Morning Joe  on June 10, 2009. Otherwise, he said, power companies will pass the cost of buying those credits on to the consumer, driving up the price of energy.
 
Pence wanted to make clear that he was not taking credit for that economic prediction.

""I don't think you need to look any further than the president himself ... who literally said [if] his cap-and-trade proposals were to pass, that utility rates, his words now, would, 'necessarily skyrocket,'"" said Pence. He added that Democrat ""John Dingle of Michigan and the Commerce Committee said people don't realize this is a tax, and a 'great big one.'""

It didn't take us long to find Barack Obama's original quote, which came from a videotaped interview he did with the  San Francisco Chronicle  editorial board very early in the presidential campaign, January 2008.

""Under my plan of a cap-and-trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket,"" Obama told the  Chronicle  . ""Coal-powered plants, you know, natural gas, you name it, whatever the plants were, whatever the industry was, they would have to retrofit their operations. That will cost money. They will pass that money on to consumers.""

While Obama was talking specifically about cap-and-trade, he was also making a larger point that the biggest challenge will be making sure voters understand why such a plan is necessary.

""The problem is can you get the American people to say this is really important,"" Obama said.

So, Pence is right. Obama did say that cap-and-trade would be costly to power plants and to consumers.

What's fuzzy, however, is  how  costly. PolitiFact has already  looked into the issue  and found that estimates vary. Republicans say each household will pay $3,100 a year, a figure they came up with based upon a Massachusetts Institute of Technology study that predicted a cap-and-trade proposal would generate $366 billion annually. On March 24, 2009, we gave the claim a Pants on Fire ruling because the GOP's calculation was badly flawed and because the GOP used the figure even though the author of the MIT study had told them it was wrong. And in an April 1 letter to House Republicans, authors of the MIT study said that the report was being misinterpreted; by their count, estimates hover closer to $340 per family.

Congress has its own estimate: A 15 percent cut in carbon emissions would cost the average household about $1,600, according to a March 12, 2009, Congressional Budget Office testimony.

It is worth noting that the climate debate has changed substantially since Obama sat down with the  Chronicle  nearly a year and a half ago. Legislators have opted to give 85 percent of the polluting permits away for free instead of putting them up for sale, as Obama pledged to do on the campaign trail. In theory, this approach should reduce costs to consumers. Furthermore, revenue from auctioned permits will help consumers pay for increased energy prices, according to Obama's first budget.

Despite those potential cost cuts, there's still little disagreement that consumers will pay for cap-and-trade, whether it's $3,100 a year or $340",True,"June 11, 2009"
"""There has been no net global warming for over a decade now.""","A recent full-page newspaper ad from the libertarian Cato Institute takes issue with President Barack Obama's convictions about global warming. The ad cites then-President-elect Obama's Nov. 19 statement: ""Few challenges facing America and the world are more urgent than combating climate change. The science is beyond dispute and the facts are clear."" ""With all due respect, Mr. President, that is not true,"" the ad states in bold letters. Below that is a statement they say was signed off on by more than 100 named scientists. ""We, the undersigned scientists, maintain that the case for alarm regarding climate change is grossly overstated. Surface temperature changes over the past century have been episodic and modest and there has been no net global warming for over a decade now. After controlling for population growth and property values, there has been no increase in damages from severe weather-related events. The computer models forecasting rapid temperature change abjectly fail to explain recent climate behavior. Mr. President, your characterization of the scientific facts regarding climate change and the degree of certainty informing the scientific debate is simply incorrect."" Global warming is a complicated subject, and we're not going to flesh it all out here. But we did want to address the underpinning of this ad, the claim that ""there has been no net global warming for over a decade now."" First off, we should note that while there are some who disagree about the existence of global warming, the overwhelming consensus among scientists who study the climate is that it does, and that humans are worsening it. The definitive statement on global warming comes from a 2007 study by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of scientists from more than 130 nations. They concluded that the ""warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice and rising global average sea level."" The group also concluded that there is ""very high confidence that the global average net effect of human activities since 1750 has been one of warming."" The problem with the assertion in the Cato statement is that it is impossible to make meaningful conclusions about climate trends based on looking at a 10-year window, said Richard Heim, a meteorologist at the NOAA National Climatic Data Center Climate Monitoring Branch. People tend to think of global warming as a steady trend upward, Heim said, but that's not how it works. if you were to look at long-term trends, like a century, it looks more like steps. Temperatures wil rise for a few years, then level off or even go down a little bit, then go back up. That's why you've got to look at temperatures over many decades, he said. And if you look at the trends over the last 100 years, Heim said, ""the overall linear trend shows clear, unequivocal, unmistakable warming over that period."" Take a look for yourself at the  NOAA graph  of 100 years of global temperatures. Now, over the last dozen years, he said, global temperatures have largely plateaued. That's consistent with the trends. Typically, he said, climates will go up, then plateau until they reach a tipping point, and then rise again. ""What you are seeing in the last eight or 10 years is kind of like one of those steps,"" Heim said. ""The fact that it's not getting warmer doesn't mean we are not experiencing global warming. You can't talk about global warming over a 10 year period. The time scale is too short."" When you grab short time frames, say 10 years, it's easy to cherry-pick starting points that are particularly high or low to make your argument one way or the other. But even if you did select a 10-year frame — as cited by Cato — it would show a slight warming over time, Heim said. If you looked at just the last eight years, it would look flat. In fact, if you looked at the last four years, it would seem to be cooling. ""But this is crazy,"" Heim said. ""You have to look at the big picture."" Gavin Schmidt, a NASA climate scientist who was a reviewer on the IPCC study, called the Cato argument that there has been no global warming over the last 10 years ""fatuous and false.""

""What if I said that there had been no global warming for an hour? You would rightly tell me that this was too short a period for it to be meaningful,"" Schmidt said. ""The same is true for a 'decade'. But even so, it is false."" Schmidt directed us to a graph showing the 10-year climate trends using the four main temperature indices. The line bounces up and down like a lie detector graph, but the overall lines  all trend upward  . ""To be clear, the globe has warmed for the last decade,"" Schmidt said. ""You can get different results if you pick out your start dates carefully, a practice known as cherry-picking since it is trying to use the data
to say something other than what it generally shows, but you are much better off looking at the longest time scales you have (such as  these from NASA  )."" Cato cited a study on the internal variability of the climate system to support its claim. But the paper, from Kyle Swanson and Anastasios Tsonis, doesn't dispute the long-term trend of climate change, Schmidt said. He cited this conclusion from the paper: ""If the role of internal variability in the climate system is as large as this analysis would seem to suggest, warming over the 21st century may well be larger than that predicted by the current generation of models, given the propensity of those models to underestimate climate internal variability.""

Said Schmidt: ""Quoting this paper to support a claim that global warming has stopped is like quoting Ronald McDonald in support of vegetarianism."" In conclusion, most scientists who study climate say that cherry-picking a 10-year window is inappropriate. But in this case, cherry picking exactly 10 years (Cato said a decade) still doesn't support their claim",False,"April 1, 2009"
