“Let’s be clear: ‘drag shows’ are strip shows.”,"In recent years, drag shows have become a target for conservatives. For instance, drag story hours have drawn protesters and ire on conservative talk shows, and drag performers have been accused of ""grooming"" children to be assaulted. In Wisconsin, that rhetoric recently focused on a drag show organized by Madison East High School that was postponed because of backlash and concerns about the safety of performers and attendees.  In a Jan. 5 tweet, former Gov. Scott Walker took aim at the event, sharing a photo of the school’s January newsletter, which said the show was ""family-friendly"" and ""meant to celebrate, affirm and support EHS students and staff in our LGBTQIA+ as well as our larger school community.""  ""Let’s be clear: ‘drag shows’ are strip shows,"" Walker tweeted. ""They are wrong. They are particularly wrong at school. They are definitely not ‘family-friendly.’""  Let’s focus on the first part of Walker’s claim — that ""drag shows"" and ""strip shows"" are the same.  In short, they are not. When we asked Walker about his tweet, he defended his position.  ""In my opinion, if people take off clothing or play music or are given dollar bills by members of the audience, that is a strip show, regardless of gender,"" he said in an emailed statement. But Walker is painting a distorted picture of what a drag show actually is.  According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, drag is ""entertainment in which performers caricature or challenge gender stereotypes (as by dressing in clothing that is stereotypical of another gender, by using exaggeratedly gendered mannerisms, or by combining elements of stereotypically male and female dress) and often wear elaborate or outrageous costumes.""  Essentially, drag is the ""art of dressing and acting exaggeratedly as another gender, usually for entertainment,"" according to an Oct. 22, 2022, article from PBS NewsHour. Though, as the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defmation notes in its definition of ""drag performance,"" drag shows include performers who are gay, cisgender men as well as transgender women and other gender-diverse people.  Its origins actually stretch deep into the history of theater.  ""Drag is a term derived from ancient Greek theater, a Greek word meaning ‘masquerade,’ and its roots have remained in theatrical performances generally involving cross-dressing,"" Finn Enke, a professor of gender and women’s studies, history and LGBTQ+ studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told us in a Jan. 10 email.  Cross-dressing is an ancient theater practice, from before the time of Shakespeare, with male actors often playing a variety of gender roles on stage, Enke said. The term drag likely stems from the fact that the dresses or petticoats worn by male actors onstage would drag across the floor, or perhaps as an acronym, used in some scripts to mean ""dress as a girl,"" according to the NewsHour article.  Walker’s claim also hints at another argument made repeatedly by opponents of drag shows: that the performers are in a way ""grooming"" children.  According to the NewsHour article, the term is used to describe how child molesters entrap and sexually abuse their victims. It’s used by opponents of drag to falsely equate the shows and performers with pedophilia and other forms of child abuse.  ""Perpetrators of the false rhetoric can then cast themselves as saviors of children and try to frame anyone who disagrees – a political opponent, for example – as taking the side of child abusers,"" the article said.  ""Despite some opponents’ claims, drag cannot ‘turn’ a child gay or transgender, although its playful use of gender may be reassuring to kids who are already questioning their identity.""  Now, let’s take a look at what a ""strip show"" is.  According to Merriam-Webster, to strip is to ""take off clothes"" or ""to remove one’s clothes gradually piece by piece in a seductive or provocative manner especially to the accompaniment of music.""  Of course, there is also music, dancing and often money given to the performers by spectators.  But drag doesn’t inherently imply nudity or the removal of clothes, according to the NewsHour story.  ""Every performer makes different choices, but drag queens often wear more, not less, clothing than you’d see on a typical American woman of the 21st century, a public beach or on network TV,"" the article said. ""Drag does not typically involve nudity or stripping, which are more common in burlesque, a separate form of entertainment.""   When asked whether he had ever attended either a strip show or a drag show, Walker did not respond.  Walker claimed that ""strip shows"" and ""drag shows"" were the same type of performance.  Although both types of performance do include music and dancing, drag shows typically don’t include the central feature of strip shows: nudity or the removal of clothing",False,"January 25, 2023"
Harvard Medical School students “learn how to care for LGBTQIA+ infants.”,"Harvard University has come under scrutiny after reports that it offers a course teaching students how to care for babies who identify as LGBTQ. ""This is not a joke,"" a man says in a TikTok video with the label ""Harvard med students learn how to care for LGBTQIA+ infants."" The TikTok video also was shared on Facebook, and the claim was amplified on that platform by conservative commentator Candace Owens.  The man reads aloud a Jan. 11 story from a conservative blog called Hot Air that claims a Harvard Medical School elective teaches students about babies with various gender identities or sexual orientations.  But the blog post and several other stories from conservative news outlets distort the content of the course, which does not teach students that babies can identify as LGBTQ.

Harvard Medical School’s four-week course, titled ""Caring for Patients with Diverse Sexual Orientations, Gender Identities, and Sex Development,"" trains students to care for patients of all ages, according to its description.

When it comes to infants, the class teaches only about the physical development of babies who are born intersex, Dr. Alex Keuroghlian, the associate professor who teaches the class, told The Associated Press.  Intersex is a general term used for a variety of physical conditions in which a person is born with reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn’t fit the typical definitions of female or male. The conditions may or may not be noticeable at birth.  In a statement, Harvard Medical School said the claims ""neglected to mention that some infants are born with variations in sex development.""  The school’s statement said the course teaches about providing care for infants who have ""physical variations in sex development that arise in utero and are present at birth. These include chromosomal, gonadal, and anatomical variations, all of which are relevant to medical care and treatment to ensure healthy development.""

“All ‘gender affirming care’ for children is 100% experimental. There are zero long term studies on the effects the drugs and surgeries will have on them.”,"The word ""experimental"" can trigger fear of the unknown and may suggest unforeseeable consequences or complications. Lawmakers aiming to restrict access to gender-affirming care have embraced the term, arguing that their proposals will protect children from such ""experimental"" treatments. A Jan. 1 Instagram post echoed that alarm. ""All ‘gender affirming care’ for children is 100% experimental,"" read the Instagram post featuring a screenshot of a tweet. ""There are zero long term studies on the effects the drugs and surgeries will have on them."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.)  (Screenshot from Instagram.) Gender-affirming care is an individualized approach to health care that centers, encourages and supports a person’s gender identity, experts said.  The World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s standards of care noted that gender-affirming care is more than just transition-related medical treatments such as hormone therapy or surgical procedures. Gender-affirming care for children might include allowing a child to wear whatever clothes they like or encouraging the use of the name and pronouns that align with the child’s gender identity, said Dr. Michelle Forcier, a pediatrics professor who specializes in gender and sexual and reproductive health at The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University. Those types of emotional and social affirmation — which also include creating a safe space to explore gender identity — are important elements of pediatric gender-affirming care, said Dr. Jason Rafferty, a pediatrician and child psychiatrist at Hasbro Children’s Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island.  Forcier and Rafferty emphasized that gender-affirming care for children is based on individual needs and goals. Social support is the only type of gender-affirming care recommended for children before puberty, said Shane Diamond, a World Professional Association for Transgender Health spokesperson. As children reach adolescence, medical treatments might become part of their care. Dr. Renata Arrington-Sanders, an adolescent and young adult medicine associate professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, said there is ""an extensive body of evidence-based, peer reviewed research on gender-affirming care"" that informs current standards set by organizations, including the Endocrine Society, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health.  Puberty-blocking medication might be an element of gender-affirming care for children who reach puberty and experience gender dysphoria — a feeling of distress when their bodies don’t align with their gender identity. Puberty blockers ""help delay unwanted physical changes that don’t match someone’s gender identity,"" according to St. Louis Children’s Hospital. They were first used in the U.S. for gender-affirming care in 2007, Rafferty said. But they have been prescribed in Europe at least since the mid-1990s to treat adolescents with persistent gender dysphoria. The medication gives children time to explore their identities and consider additional treatment options. Research, including a 22-year follow-up study, shows that medication helps alleviate psychological distress in adolescence and supports a child’s development into adulthood. Puberty blockers contain gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs, which suppress the body’s release of sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone.  Although puberty blockers weren't designed for gender-affirming care, their use for this purpose has been studied and isn't considered ""experimental"" by experts. ""‘Experimental’ in this context is a political term designed to create drama, confusion, and terror,"" said Forcier. ""Medical care is always being evaluated and studied so we can provide the best care."" Every medication has side effects, Arrington-Sanders said, but doctors monitor the side effects of medications used to suppress puberty. Studies demonstrate the long-term efficacy and positive impacts that gender-affirming care such as puberty blockers has on transgender youth, said C.P. Hoffman, senior policy counsel at the National Center for Transgender Equality. Hoffman pointed to a gender dysphoria research overview by doctors and researchers at the Yale School of Medicine, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Children’s Medical Center Dallas and other institutions.  The researchers noted that studies in 2015 and 2022 found that puberty blockers helped young people with gender dysphoria.  California state Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, discusses his proposed measure to provide legal refuge to displaced transgender youth and their families on March 17, 2022, at a news conference in Sacramento, California. (AP) Feminizing or masculinizing hormone therapies might be another element of gender-affirming care that may be recommended when a patient is capable of giving informed consent —  around age 16, according to the Endocrine Society. Like puberty blockers, gender-affirming hormone therapy medications aren’t approved specifically for gender affirmation use, and instead are approved and commonly used for contraception, managing menopause, for male pattern baldness and more. But the hormones themselves are ""considered safe (and) effective, especially when medically monitored,"" said Forcier of Brown University. Substantial evidence shows that access to gender-affirming hormone therapies when young reduces the long-term risk of suicide, anxiety, depression and gender dysphoria. Gender-affirming surgeries are typically recommended for and provided to adults.  Certain gender-affirming surgeries, such as masculinizing chest surgery, are sometimes provided to teenagers, though this is rare. There is not much research on the long-term impact they have on adolescents, Rafferty said. Some things about gender-affirming care, such as how it affects fertility, are still being researched. But experts said this is the nature of medicine and pediatrics.  Rafferty said, ""When most people hear ‘experimental’ they feel it means that providers do not know what they are doing or (are) guessing when making clinical decisions."" But additional studies and research happen routinely to learn more about a topic and to develop better practices and standards of care. An Instagram post claimed, ""All ‘gender affirming care’ for children is 100% experimental. There are zero long term studies on the effects the drugs and surgeries will have on them."" Experts said it is inaccurate to call all gender-affirming care for children ""experimental,"" because the approach, including the use of puberty blockers, is evidence-based. Research also shows that gender-affirming care reduces the risk of suicide, anxiety, depression and gender dysphoria. For prepubescent children, gender-affirming care does not involve medication or surgeries; instead, it’s about social affirmation such as allowing a child to wear gender-affirming clothes or adopt a gender-affirming hairstyle.  There’s an element of truth to the claim: There aren’t many long-term studies on the effects of gender-affirming surgeries for youth, but that’s because they aren’t done on children and rarely on teenagers",Mostly False,"January 17, 2023"
"""Joe Biden and the New Left even promote surgery on teens and young adults, removing breasts and genitals.""","A radio ad targeting care for transgender kids began airing in cities around the country this fall — from Spanish-language stations in Corpus Christi, Texas, to sports talk shows in Tennessee to pop radio in Detroit. The ads, paid for by a political advocacy group founded by Stephen Miller, a longtime speechwriter and senior adviser to former President Donald Trump, were deemed so incendiary by one radio station owner that they were pulled in major markets. The minute-long script from America First Legal, titled ""Not Anymore,"" accuses President Joe Biden of ""pushing radical gender experiments"" with hormone therapy. ""Joe Biden and the New Left even promote surgery on teens and young adults, removing breasts and genitals,"" the ad claims. With a man’s voice speaking over ominous music, the ad says the White House is pushing boys to appear more feminine by taking estrogen and girls to grow facial hair by taking testosterone. The ad also suggests Democrats are pushing puberty blockers ""to keep kids from developing into normal men and women."" In August, PolitiFact rated a similar statement by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as Mostly False.  The state’s medical boards, appointed by DeSantis, in early November banned hormonal treatment and surgeries for minors. But because the America First Legal ad is aimed directly at a Biden administration policy and highlights what’s become a hot topic on the midterm elections campaign trail and in broader cultural debates, we decided to investigate further. First, we checked with America First Legal about the basis for its statements. The group didn’t respond to repeated emails and phone calls. But General Counsel Gene Hamilton released a statement to Politico regarding a news report about the ad: ""We believe in biology and we believe that confused children should not be harmed permanently by individuals with radical agendas."" A document from America First Legal that was filed by Detroit radio station WDRQ-FM with the Federal Communications Commission and obtained by KHN and PolitiFact revealed more specific justifications for the ad’s claim. It cites a two-page explainer published by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Population Affairs in March 2022. The first two paragraphs explain that gender-affirming care ""consists of an array of services that may include medical, surgical, mental health, and non-medical services"" for transgender people, and that ""early gender-affirming care is crucial to overall health and well-being as it allows the child or adolescent to focus on social transitions."" The document seems to communicate that gender-affirming care is important for transgender and nonbinary kids but makes no specific endorsement of surgeries. The Biden administration was asked about the ad in a White House briefing, and spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said simply: ""Transgender rights are indeed human rights."" HHS declined to explain its position on gender-affirming surgeries but released a statement to KHN describing what spokesperson Adam Sarvana called ""a disturbing wave of radical attacks on some of our country’s most vulnerable children."" ""The Biden-Harris administration trusts parents, but we are unfortunately seeing interference in people’s medical decisions that jeopardizes potentially life-saving care,"" he said. The message is unequivocal support for gender-affirming care, especially to address the high rate of suicide among trans teens. One White House fact sheet says the administration is ""confirming the positive impact of gender affirming care on youth mental health."" The White House frames access to care as a civil right for transgender people. The White House statements largely echo those of leading medical groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics. The professional association representing 67,000 pediatricians has similarly been accused of pushing gender-affirming care, but Dr. Moira Szilagyi, the academy’s president, has been fending off what she calls ""extremists."" ""Critics of our gender-affirming care policy mischaracterize it as pushing medical or surgical treatments on youth; in fact, the policy calls for the opposite: a holistic, collaborative, compassionate approach to care with no end goal or agenda,"" she wrote in an August blog post. The America First Legal ad points specifically to surgery for teens and young adults. This, in itself, is complicated. The guidelines from the World Professional Association of Transgender Health were updated in September, and they do broaden allowances for genital surgery for minors. But such surgeries are rare. Vanderbilt University Medical Center, which has been at the center of a firestorm over its pediatric transgender care clinic, said it has never performed genital surgery on a minor. Breast removal is also more acceptable for older teens under the new WPATH guidelines. The numbers have grown in recent years but remain relatively small compared with hormone therapy, which is a far more common treatment for teens. Data analysis of insurance claims by Reuters found ""top surgery"" — which refers to the removal of the breasts — is growing each year, but fewer than 300 minors a year are having the operations. Dr. Michele Hutchison, chief of pediatric endocrinology at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, laughed at the notion the Biden administration is pushing such surgery. ""The only people that I’ve ever met that push it are the patients,"" said Hutchison, who also cared for transgender youth in Arkansas. ""If anything, it’s usually us, as medical professionals, saying, ‘Hey, let’s take a beat. Let’s stop and think about it.’"" Hutchison said she has never recommended a minor for genital surgery. The ad’s truth hinges on whether the White House is promoting or pushing gender-affirming care. What concerns Dr. Michael O’Brien, a pediatrician in South Carolina and an LGBTQ advocate, is that the materials used to justify the ad read like ""objective information."" ""The document from HHS does not promote or push any medical treatment so much as it describes it in technical terms,"" he said. Even leaders of the Society for Evidence-based Gender Medicine, who are skeptical of the acceleration in gender-affirmation care, said ""it is not accurate to say that the Biden administration is pushing these interventions on kids."" ""Presumably, children don’t read the statements by the administration endorsing gender-affirming care,"" a society spokesperson said. ""We find the politicization of transgender health deeply problematic and unhelpful. Unfortunately, much of the U.S. has taken a politicized approach, on both sides of the debate."" The ad says: ""Joe Biden and the New Left even promote surgery on teens and young adults, removing breasts and genitals."" Experts in the field, LGBTQ advocates, and even critics of gender-affirming care, say they find the message misleading. Some media outlets such as the Florida-based Beasley Media Group took the ad off the air, noting in internal emails published in FCC filings that the company’s attorneys found ""the substantiation is inadequate to support the claims"" and that the spot is ""not in the best interest of our company and or listeners."" Some of the ad spots also were pulled by iHeartMedia stations in Pittsburgh. The Biden policy specifically lists surgery among the ""array of services"" that should be available  and notes that ""early gender-affirming care is crucial."" But the adleaves out other types of care — such as mental health services — that are considered the starting point for caring for this  at-risk population. The ad’s key factual problem is the use of the words ""promote"" and ""push."" Ensuring a treatment option is available doesn’t mean it’s being pushed, and to cast it as such is hyperbolic",False,"November 8, 2022"
"California state Sen. Scott Wiener “doesn’t just want to sterilize California kids, but sterilization of kids everywhere!”","Forced sterilization is the stuff human rights organizations rail against. The International Justice Resource Center, for example, calls it ""a human rights violation and can constitute an act of genocide, gender-based violence, discrimination, and torture."" But an Instagram post suggests that one California lawmaker is advocating sterilization of children everywhere. The Oct. 23 post showed a Halloween event in which three adults in costumes stand next to a man in everyday attire who offers handfuls of candy to children. ""That is senator Scott Weiner handing candy to that little girl,"" the Instagram post said. ""She looks very uncomfortable doesn’t she?

The post was flagged as part of Instagram’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) Wiener, a Democrat and an attorney whose district includes San Francisco, has been a member of the California Assembly since 2016. He sponsored California Senate Bill 107. It does not call for youth sterilization, as this post suggests. The legislation is meant to protect transgender youth and their families who seek refuge in California after fleeing states that have banned gender-affirming health care for youths.  The measure also clarifies that California courts have jurisdiction over any custody cases that may arise from parents taking their children to the state for care. California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the bill, also known as the gender-affirming health care bill, Sept. 29; it will become law in 2023. As defined by the World Health Organization, gender-affirming (also referred to as gender-affirmative) health care broadly refers to any ""social, psychological, behavioral or medical (including hormonal treatment or surgery) interventions designed to support and affirm an individual’s gender identity."" In a statement to PolitiFact via a spokesperson, Weiner called the claim ""vile"" and ""untrue.""  ""Opponents to the law are willfully mischaracterizing it, including claiming lawmakers support the ‘sterilization’ of children,"" he said. ""The only thing that SB 107 does is ensure that parents and doctors won’t go to jail for allowing trans kids to be who they are by allowing life-saving healthcare."" Earlier this year, a host of states introduced varied proposals that would make it a crime for legal guardians to help their children gain access to gender-affirming care. Texas’ Republican governor, Greg Abbott, wrote a letter to state health agencies saying that offering gender-affirming care ""constitutes child abuse"" and requiring doctors, nurses and teachers report such cases to Texas’ Department of Family and Protective Services. A judge partially blocked the directive’s enforcement, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said denying said care to trans youth breached federal law. An Instagram video claimed that Wiener, a California state lawmaker,  ""doesn’t just want to sterilize California kids, but sterilization of kids everywhere!""

California’s Senate Bill 107 means “your child can now be taken from your custody if you do not affirm gender-reassignment surgery.”,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom recently signed into law a measure that aims to strengthen protections for transgender youths and their families. Senate Bill 107 contains an array of safeguards for families who arrive in California from states where their children have been denied gender-affirming health care. It bans courts from enforcing subpoenas from other states regarding minors seeking that care. It prohibits health care providers from releasing medical information. And it clarifies that California courts have jurisdiction over any child custody cases arising from parents taking their children to the state for care. But a Sept. 29 Facebook post went further to suggest the law says something else:  ""Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Senate Bill 107 into law. In the state of California, your child can now be taken from your custody if you do not affirm gender-reassignment surgery."" The post, shared by the American Council, is a screenshot of a tweet by the group’s founder, Tanner DiBella. The American Council describes itself as an organization dedicated to increasing voter turnout among Christian evangelicals.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) DiBella told PolitiFact the California Legislative Counsel’s summary of the law backs up his reasoning. He pointed specifically to a passage of the summary at the top of bill’s text that reads, ""The bill would authorize a court to take temporary jurisdiction because a child has been unable to obtain gender-affirming health care."" But experts we spoke to said that doesn’t mean the state would take custody of the child — it clarifies that California courts would assume jurisdiction of the legal matter. Current law allows California courts to decline jurisdiction in multistate custody matters in certain circumstances. Courtney Joslin, a Martin Luther King Jr. professor of law at the University of California, Davis School of Law, said the law has nothing to do with who gets custody of a child during a dispute and makes no mention of allowing the court to take custody. ""It’s just describing which courts have jurisdiction in those multi-state (custody disputes),"" she said. ""There’s no possibility that this bill could be interpreted to do what this person is claiming."" Asaf Orr, a senior staff attorney and Transgender Youth Project director at the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said the bill doesn’t give California carte blanche to remove a child from a parent’s custody.  If parents disagree over whether their child should receive gender-affirming care in California, a state court would hear that case and rule based on evidence provided by both parents, Orr said. Out-of-state laws would not apply to the court’s determination.  Orr said this isn't a new thing, as a state already has jurisdiction over court cases related to children who recently entered that state, for reasons such as escaping from domestic violence.  ""It just ensures that, in situations like this, the court recognizes they have jurisdiction to hear these cases and that they’re going to decide them based on the evidence,"" he said. ""Both parties, as in any court case, will have the opportunity to present evidence and it’s going to be individualized for that young person."" Wendy Seiden, a visiting professor at Chapman University’s Fowler School of Law, said there is nothing in the law that would allow California to take custody of a child. But it does allow California to resist another state’s attempt to remove a parent’s custody if the proposed removal is based on that parent’s efforts to get gender-affirming care for their child. California state Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, an attorney and Senate Bill 170’s author, described DiBella’s interpretation of the text as ""categorically false."" ""It doesn’t change custody laws in any way,"" Wiener said. ""It just means that, rather than having to go back to Texas or Alabama, they can do it in court here.""  Weiner said he authored the bill in response to proposed legislation in other states involving transgender youth. It provides guidance, he said, for California courts concerning custody hearings involving transgender youths and it helps protect parents who decide to bring their children to the state. ""This bill literally protects parents’ ability to make decisions about children's health care without having to be thrown in prison,"" Wiener said. At least 24 states have proposed bills since Jan. 1 targeting transgender or nonbinary youths’ ability to receive gender-affirming care.   In Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott issued a directive earlier this year that ordered state officials to launch child abuse investigations of parents suspected of allowing their child to receive gender-affirming care.  Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey signed a law in April that makes providing gender-affirming care for youths a felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison. A Facebook post claims that a recently signed California law dealing with gender-affirming care for transgender youth will allow that state to take custody of a child from a parent.  Experts said that’s not so.

Says “Tim Michels doesn’t think gay people should be out in public.”,"Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and his Republican challenger in November’s gubernatorial election don’t see eye to eye on a critical issue for LGBTQ Wisconsinites: Same-sex marriage.  Evers, who was the first governor to fly the Pride flag over the Capitol in 2019, said in his most recent comment on the issue that he wanted to see federal legislation to protect gay marriage. (The U.S. Supreme Court struck down all bans on it in 2015, but some worry that could change in a future ruling.) His opponent, construction executive Tim Michels, said in a June 15, 2022, interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that he believes marriage should be between a man and a woman.  It’s the same opinion he held in 2004 when he ran for one of Wisconsin’s Senate seats. Then, a majority of the American public agreed with him. Today, that viewpoint is in the minority, with 71% of Americans supporting same-sex marriage according to a June 1, 2022, Gallup poll — a new high.  As the general election nears, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin seized on a related comment from Michels during his Senate run, which he made in an Oct. 16, 2004, debate against then-incumbent Democrat Russ Feingold.  When asked how the candidates would protect the rights of LGBTQ Wisconsinites, Michels responded that every American ""deserves to be treated as an American, but I think when you bring it out of your house, and onto the public street, that's where I differ. I believe in family values.""  He went on to say that he would support a constitutional amendment that would specify marriage as being between a man and a woman.  ""Tim Michels doesn’t think gay people should be out in public,"" an Aug. 8, 2022, news release from the Democratic Party of Wisconsin read, outlining what it described as ""radical"" positions Michels and his primary challenger, former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, held over their careers.  Michels’ position on same-sex marriage is crystal clear. But the Democratic Party’s statement is a major stretch.  Let’s take a look.  When asked for evidence of the party’s claim, a spokesperson provided a link to the debate and news coverage of both that event and Michels’ most recent reiteration of his stance on same-sex marriage.  The debate was the only specific instance the party was referring to when it made its claim, the spokesperson said.  But that portion of Michels’ debate statement was rather ambiguous — prompting Feingold to say he was ""confused"" by the remark and did not understand what his opponent was trying to say, according to an Oct. 17, 2004, story by The Associated Press.  That article also includes a key clarification that the Democrats ignored: that Michels ""later clarified that he did not mean (LGBTQ people) should not bring their sexuality into public, but people shouldn’t have ‘gay values’ imposed upon them.""  It’s certainly not a statement friendly to the LGBTQ community. But Michels explicitly said he didn’t mean that they shouldn’t be allowed to be out in public — which directly refutes what the Democratic Party of Wisconsin is now claiming, 18 years later, that he said.  A spokesperson for Michels’ campaign said the attention to the old quote is ""the latest sad example"" of Democrats ""grasping at straws"" to attack their opponent. She pointed to a June 28, 2022, radio interview Michels did with WISN radio host Dave Michaels in which he said the issue of gay marriage was settled by the U.S. Supreme Court seven years ago and that it’s not a priority given other issues he’d want to focus on as governor. Still, Michels has made his personal viewpoint on these issues clear. He opposes same-sex marriage and has slammed his rivals for supporting it, saying in a July 22, 2022, campaign event in Menomonee Falls, ""the Democratic Party now is all about LGBTQ IQ, and it’s all about drag shows for third-graders.""  He didn’t answer a June question from a reporter about whether he would take steps as governor to limit gay people’s rights, saying, ""As a businessman, what I do is I look at what’s in the legislation and it’s all about the details. So, I am very hesitant to do hypotheticals on a broadly stated question like that."" But the claim that he doesn’t believe gay people should be able to own their identity in public — especially when its one reference comes from a decade plus-ago debate — is an exaggeration.  A news release from the Democratic Party of Wisconsin claimed that ""Tim Michels doesn’t think gay people should be out in public.""  Michels has made clear his opposition to a critical issue for the LGBTQ community and has criticized Democrats for focusing on such issues.

The headline read, ""He fuels the right’s cultural fires (and spreads them to Florida),"" a reference to his support for a new Florida law prohibiting some teachers from discussing L.G.B.T.Q. issues with students.  The subheadline explains: ""Christopher Rufo helped make critical race theory a conservative rallying cry. Now he sees L.G.B.T.Q. issues as an even more potent line of attack."" There’s also a portrait of Rufo standing on a beach with his thumbs hooked in his pockets.  That same picture appeared in another supposed New York Times story that’s spreading on social media. In what looks like a screenshot from the newspaper’s website, the headline says: ""He was one of the right’s most outspoken leaders. Then he got sick.""

"“In Virginia, we actually do protect same-sex marriage.”","Gov. Glenn Youngkin was elusive when recently asked if he would take action to guarantee same sex-marriage under Virginia law. ""In Virginia, we actually do protect same-sex marriage,"" Youngkin, a Republican, told a national television audience June 10 on ""Face the Nation."" ""That’s the law in Virginia and therefore, as governor of Virginia, we protect same-sex marriage."" A number of state Democrats later accused Youngkin of spreading — to put it nicely — malarkey.  ""The Governor either doesn’t know Virginia’s constitution or he’s lying & assuming we won’t notice,"" tweeted U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger. State Sen. Adam Ebbin of Alexandria told the Richmond Times-Dispatch, ""Either [Youngkin] is ignorant of the status of gay marriage in Virginia or chose to lie."" So, we fact checked Youngkin’s statement.   Same-sex marriage in Virginia and across the nation is guaranteed by the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges.   But here’s what Youngkin didn’t mention on camera: The Obergefell decision, made on a 5-to-4 vote, supersedes a still-existing provision in Virginia’s constitution that prohibits same-sex marriage. Should the current conservative majority on the high court reverse Obergefell, same-sex marriage would instantly become illegal in Virginia. Virginia’s constitutional ban on same-sex marriage was approved by voters in 2006. The General Assembly passed a bill in 2021 to ask voters to repeal the amendment. But proposed amendments to Virginia’s constitution must be passed by the legislature two straight years before they’re placed on ballots and, earlier this year, a subcommittee in the Republican-led House killed the bill on a 6-to-4 vote. Youngkin’s press secretary, Macaulay Porter, noted that the General Assembly passed legislation that repealed a state law barring same-sex marriage. But state laws are subservient to Virginia’s constitution, which still has the ban. The constitutional amendment ""makes it clear that no other relationship may, by law, be given the status of a legal marriage,"" A.E. Dick Howard, a professor at the University of Virginia’s law school, wrote in an email. ""If Obergefell were to be overturned, then, in Virginia, the marriage amendment would take precedence over any conflicting provision of state law. Same-sex marriages would not be recognized in Virginia."" Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond’s law school, agreed. ""If the Supreme Court reversed itself, same-sex marriage would become illegal [in Virginia],"" he said. A key question is whether the Obergefell decision is in danger of being reversed, a matter Youngkin dismissed as ""hypothetical."" But many legal observers and members of the LGBTQ+ community see it as a real possibility following the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade in June, a 49-year-old precedent guaranteeing abortion rights. The court empowered states to set their own abortion laws. Justice Clarence Thomas deepened concerns in his concurring opinion, writing that the court should review its decisions in Obergefell and other ""demonstratively erroneous"" cases that have granted rights not specifically mentioned in the U.S. Constitution. Other justices in the majority did not echo Thomas’s sentiment and stressed that their ruling only applied to abortion.  Youngkin said, ""In Virginia, we actually do protect same-sex marriage. That’s the law in Virginia and therefore, as governor of Virginia, we protect same-sex marriage."" His statement is disingenuous. The only reason Virginia protects same-sex marriage is because a 2015 Supreme Court ruling requires all states to do so. Virginia law tacitly allows same-sex marriage. But it is superseded by the state constitution that specifically bans such unions, a provision that the Republican-led House stood by earlier this year. Should the high court reverse its 2015 ruling, as Thomas would like to see, same-sex marriage in Virginia would instantly end. Younkin told viewers of ""Face the Nation"" a small piece of the story. Although Virginia allows gay marriage, the state law he cites as protecting it is meaningless",Mostly False,"July 15, 2022"
The official pride flag was altered to include Ukrainian colors.,"An image of an LGBTQ pride flag that incorporated Ukraine’s yellow and blue colors is circulating on social media as if it were an official gay pride flag, with users sharing the image and mocking the addition. ""They officially added Ukraine to the pride flag,"" one Facebook user wrote alongside the image and another graphic that said ""I sexually identify as Ukrainian!"" ""I’m starting to think this isn’t about gay rights anymore,"" a person on Twitter said.  It even caught the attention of Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who shared the image on Twitter as if it were legitimate and wrote: ""Do the Nazis in the Ukrainian army know?"" But the flag is fake — it was created as satire.  We reached out to Greene’s office for comment. Her spokesperson responded that the pride flag ""itself isn’t real."" The image appears to have originated with a Twitter account with a gay slur in its handle as a means of mocking LGBTQ activists’ efforts to demonstrate inclusivity. Many people are familiar with the rainbow flag as a symbol of gay rights and the LGBTQ community. June is the traditional month when gay pride is celebrated and rainbow flags abound.  In 2018, trans activists added a chevron and more colors to the rainbow flag and called it the progress pride flag, to specifically include transgender people, people of color and AIDS patients. Flags associated with and used by the LGBTQ community have been in a state of evolution since the original rainbow flag was created by Gilbert Baker for the 1978 Gay Freedom Day Parade in San Francisco.  It’s important to note that there isn’t one official gay pride flag.  Activists created other flags over the years to represent different groups of the LGBTQ community. These include a trans pride flag, which has five horizontal stripes that are light blue, light pink and white, and a bisexual pride flag, which has pink on the top, royal blue on the bottom, and a purple stripe in the middle. While the image with Ukraine’s colors originated as a joke and isn’t affiliated with any official LGBTQ organizations, Snopes reported that Dublin’s LGBTQ Pride Festival used a different flag on a flyer with Ukrainian colors on the top and bottom to welcome displaced refugees from the country. Greene and others shared an image that showed the pride flag altered to incorporate the colors of the Ukrainian flag as if it were real. This isn’t a genuine flag used by the LGBTQ community.

A Reddit post shows a parent admitting to forcing their child to continue transitioning by sneaking hormone medication.,"As states across the country continue to introduce a flurry of legislation targeting the LGBTQ+ community, a Reddit post gives the impression that a parent is forcing their child to continue to transition from male to female. ""Anyone else having trouble convincing your teen kids to continue transitioning,"" the post said. ""My 14-year-old daughter (AMAB) has started refusing her estradiol so I’ve been crushing the pills and putting it in her cereal."" AMAB stands for assigned male at birth. ""This is f------ child abuse and I’ll die on this Hill,"" read one tweet that re-shared the screenshot. ""Good parenting,"" read another, sarcastically. The post isn’t legitimate. The ""r/transparenttranskid"" subreddit it was shared on was created so people could roleplay as transgender parents and promote inflammatory comments and fabricated abusive practices in the transgender community. It has since been removed by Reddit. An August 2021 conversation in an online forum found by Reuters revealed  that users were planning on creating false posts on the subreddit to escalate outrage. ""Don't make the bait posts too obvious,"" the author wrote, ""but you don't have to try too hard either since redditors will eat up anything that makes them mad.""  A person with the username ""Funkyduffy"" responded to a call to ""snap up"" the subreddit and fill it with fake stories. The same username was behind the post about the forced estradiol. The ""r/transparenttranskid"" subreddit was eventually shut down by Reddit because it violated the website’s rules and spread hateful stereotypes, a platform moderator said in an August 25, 2021, post about the channel’s shuttering.  Trolls created the account to ""roleplay as transgender parents of transgender children, in order to platform hateful stereotypes of transgender people,"" the moderator wrote. ""That subreddit has now been shuttered by Reddit for generally violating the Reddit Rules; They were engaged in promoting hatred of transgender people, as well as targeted harassment."" Estradiol typically treats symptoms caused by menopause. While it is used as a hormone to promote feminine characteristics when a person is transitioning, it is not routinely part of gender-affirming care for a 14-year-old.  Gender-affirming care encompasses a range of social, psychological, behavioral and medical interventions designed to support and affirm a person's gender identity when it conflicts with the gender they were assigned at birth. For teens, this is most often social transitions — name, personal pronouns, clothes — as well as puberty blockers. Gender-affirming hormone therapy is typically approved to begin at age 16, though it can vary.

New York City is “wasting taxpayer money on” billboards in Florida.,"New York City Mayor Eric Adams approached a lectern flanked by signage that bore the word ""Gay,"" and addressed the state of Florida.  It was Monday, April 4, and standing alongside the 61-year-old mayor were 10 adults, one of whom wore a rainbow-colored face mask.  ""This is the city of Stonewall,"" Adams said, invoking the historic 1969 gay rights demonstrations that followed a police raid at the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in New York City. ""This is the city where we are proud to talk about how you can live in a comfortable setting and not be harassed, not be abused — not only as adults but also as young people."" At the City Hall event, Adams chastised Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for signing into law HB 1557, dubbed the ""don’t say gay"" bill by critics. The legislation prohibits classroom instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade. Then the mayor announced an ad campaign to address the issue.  For eight weeks — starting April 4 — five pieces of creative art condemning the law will be displayed on billboards across major cities in Florida. The ad campaign was spotted on a billboard in Jacksonville, Florida, following the announcement.  We have a message for Florida’s LGBTQ+ community: come to a city where you can be you. Join us now at City Hall. https://t.co/0OOg7zigSB The move drew national media coverage and seemed to touch a nerve with DeSantis. ""Now, New York is doing billboards telling people come, come to New York from Florida,"" DeSantis said at a press conference on April 5. ""You know, they're wasting taxpayer money on doing that. I don't know why they would do it."" DeSantis’ claim sounded at odds with what Adams said when he announced the ad campaign, so we looked into it.  Adams said at the event that the campaign is ""costing New York City taxpayers nothing.""  The artwork that will be displayed on the billboards is being created by a multinational marketing company, WPP, and its subsidiaries, VMLY&R and Kinetic, among others, that won’t charge New York City for that effort. Kinetic is paying for the costs associated with putting up the billboards.  Graham Smith, the managing director of VMLY&R and the company’s lead on the effort, confirmed to PolitiFact that the creative content was donated.  The head of public affairs at WPP North America, Brian Ellner, also confirmed his firm is donating creative work and is securing donated media. Adams, Ellner said, ""pledged that no tax dollars would be used to support"" the ad campaign.  DeSantis did not return PolitiFact’s request for comment. We found no news reports or credible evidence to suggest that the city paid for the ad campaign. DeSantis said that New York City is ""wasting taxpayer money on"" placing billboards in Florida. Adams and the private marketing firms involved in the ad campaign have denied this characterization. WPP developed the creative content used in the campaign on a pro bono basis, and the billboard space was secured through one of its agencies.  We found no evidence to support that the city contributed financially to the campaign.

"Virginia Tech swimmer Reka Gyorgy tweeted, “My finals spot was stolen by Lia Thomas, who is a biological male.”","An imposter Twitter account claiming to belong to Virginia Tech swimmer Reka Gyorgy purported to show Gyorgy tweeting that her ""finals spot was stolen"" in a race won by Lia Thomas, who became the first transgender woman to win an NCAA swimming tournament. ""My finals spot was stolen by Lia Thomas, who is a biological male,"" said the March 20 tweet, posted by a hoax account named @RekaGyorgy_. ""Until we all refuse to compete nothing will change. Thanks for all the support retweets and follows I wont stop fighting.""  Before the account’s suspension, the tweet was retweeted tens of thousands of times, including by Caitlyn Jenner, a transgender woman, who wrote, ""This is not OK on any level."" Screenshots of the tweet took off on Facebook and Instagram, racking up nearly 450,000 interactions in a matter of days, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool. The screenshots were shared by prominent right-wing media organizations such as Breitbart News and the Blaze, conservative commentators like talk radio show host Ben Ferguson, and Republican politicians, including Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala.  A tweet from an imposter Twitter account was shared by conservative media, commentators and politicians. But the viral tweet did not come from Gyorgy, and the @RekaGyorgy_ account does not belong to her. ""I don't have a Twitter account,"" Gyorgy told PolitiFact in a message sent via LinkedIn. Others involved with Virginia Tech’s athletics confirmed the same.  Sergio Lopez Miro, the director and head coach of Virginia Tech’s swimming and diving team, said the account was ""fake"" and did not belong to Gyorgy. He said he reported it to Twitter. Twitter permanently suspended the account for violating its policy against platform manipulation and spam, and specifically its rules against the creation of fake accounts, a spokesperson said. The hoax Twitter account joined the platform in November 2021. It had posted only one tweet and a handful of retweets of conservative politicians and a Daily Caller reporter, according to the Internet Archive.  The imposter account was originally listed under the Twitter handle @amanda191923 before changing to @RekaGyorgy_, Reuters and the Associated Press reported. Gyorgy did publicly criticize the NCAA over its rules allowing Thomas’ participation. In February, USA Swimming announced a policy that would require transgender athletes to lower their testosterone levels for three years before competing. The new rule would have excluded Thomas from competition, but the NCAA opted not to adopt it mid-season, thereby allowing her to compete in the collegiate championships, according to the New York Times. Gyorgy, who swam for Hungary in the 2016 Olympics and finished No. 17 in the women’s 500-yard freestyle race Thomas won, penned a letter of complaint to the NCAA on March 20. Finishing outside of the top 16 meant she missed the cut to advance to the finals. ""I respect and fully stand with Lia Thomas; I am convinced that she is no different than me or any other D1 swimmer who has woken up at 5am her entire life for morning practice,"" Gyorgy wrote in the letter. ""On the other hand, I would like to critique the NCAA rules that allow her to compete against us, who are biologically women. I’m writing this letter right now in hopes that the NCAA will open their eyes and change these rules in the future."" She continued:  ""This is my last college meet ever and I feel frustrated. It feels like that final spot was taken away from me because of the NCAA’s decision to let someone who is not a biological female compete. I know you could say I had the opportunity to swim faster and make the top 16, but this situation makes it a bit different and I can’t help but be angry or sad … Every event that transgender athletes competed in was one spot taken away from biological females throughout the meet."" Social media posts claimed that Virginia Tech swimmer Reka Gyorgy tweeted, ""My finals spot was stolen by Lia Thomas, who is a biological male.""  The tweet came from an imposter Twitter account that has since been banned for violating the platform’s policies against the creation of fake accounts, a fact that was confirmed by Gyorgy as well as Virginia Tech’s swimming coach and athletics department.  Gyorgy did write a letter to the NCAA over the issue, but she didn't use those words",False,"March 24, 2022"
Says Rachel Levine supports “government-funded sex reassignment surgery without parental notification or authorization” for all children.,"Since being nominated for the post of assistant health secretary, Dr. Rachel Levine has faced repeated attacks focusing on her identity as a transgender woman.  One of these attacks circulated on social media platforms in the form of a viral image, which features a picture of Levine photoshopped next to a group of prepubescent children.  ""Dr. Rachel Levine, US Assistant Secretary for Health, believes that all children should be allowed to select their gender and have access to government-funded sex reassignment surgery without parental notification or authorization,"" reads the text beside the image. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  In support of their claims, Levine’s critics have surfaced a 2017 lecture she gave at Franklin & Marshall College, where she described professional standards of care for transgender youth. They have also referenced a tweet in which Levine cited a study that found that access to puberty blockers decreases the likelihood of suicide and mental health problems for adolecents with gender dysphoria. However, we could not find any instance where Levine advocated for children to receive government-funded gender confirmation surgery without parental consent. Performing genital surgery on prepubescent minors violates professional standards of transgender medicine.  During her lecture at Franklin & Marshall, Levine described the standards of care for transgender patients laid out by professional organizations such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health. Current U.S. health guidelines do not recommend surgical treatment for minors.  At one point of the lecture, Levine explicitly notes that the guidelines do not recommend any form of medical treatment for children prior to puberty. ""For prepubertal children (with gender dysphoria) there is no medical treatment,"" she says. ""The idea would be to see a counselor or therapist who is supportive and has knowledge about these issues, to work with the parents.""  At another point of the lecture, Levine discusses standards of care for transgender youth, laying out a three-tiered protocol drawn up by professionals in transgender medicine.  Before doctors prescribe any physical interventions, the guidelines require patients to undergo counseling and psychological evaluation by a team of health professionals, including psychologists, pediatricians and endocrinologists. This process also allows kids to begin the process of socially transitioning to another gender by using different names and wearing different clothing.  If a patient has begun to go through puberty and is determined to have experienced ""persistent, well-documented gender dysphoria"" for a long period of time, the youth becomes eligible to receive puberty blockers. These drugs suppress the release of testosterone and estrogen during puberty. The goal of this phase of treatment is to allow transgender youth more time to reflect on their decision. Different youth experience the onset of puberty at different ages, so the guidelines don’t provide a strict age threshold at which patients become eligible for the first stage of treatment. However, most studies of transgender youth have featured subjects at least 12 years old.  If the youth completes this phase of treatment, doctors can slowly start off with interventions such as hormone therapy to masculinize or feminize the body. Some of these changes (such as the deepening of the voice caused by testosterone) are irreversible. Others may require reconstructive surgery to be reversed. Many hospitals, such as the Duke Health Center for Gender Care for Children and Adolescents, will only offer hormone replacement therapies for adolescents 16 or older.  Genital surgery, the last phase of the process, is generally restricted to adults. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health guidelines state that genital surgery shouldn't be performed until the patient reaches the age of majority, which is at least 18 across the U.S. — and there are many other factors besides age that should also be considered. ""Genital surgery should not be carried out until (i) patients reach the legal age of majority to give consent for medical procedures in a given country, and (ii) patients have lived continuously for at least 12 months in the gender role that is congruent with their gender identity. The age threshold should be seen as a minimum criterion and not an indication in and of itself for active intervention,"" the guidelines read.  During her lecture, Levine noted that homeless youth could be eligible for an accelerated transition process. Since these youth lack parental support and are more likely to purchase dangerous black market hormones, she suggested that it might be necessary to skip the puberty-blocker phase of treatment and go straight to hormone therapy. However, at no point in the lecture did Levine state that homeless youth could be eligible for genital surgery before reaching the age of majority.  Facebook posts said that Rachel Levine supports ""government-funded sex reassignment surgery without parental notification or authorization"" for all children. There is no record of Levine supporting genital surgery for young children. In a lecture, Levine stated that ""there is no medical treatment"" for prepubescent children with gender dysphoria.  Performing genital surgery on prepubescent children violates the standards of care laid out by professionals in transgender medicine",False,"March 2, 2021"
"""Schools are trying to make a law that teachers can see girls' private parts to make sure they're not trans.""","In a video seen by tens of thousands of people, someone sketches in pencil as a computerized voice speaks over a recording of the song ""Michelle"" by the indie band Sir Chloe. ""This is f---ing disgusting,"" the voice says. ""Schools are trying to make a law that teachers can see girls' private parts to make sure they're not trans."" The sound in the clip has been used in more than 13,000 other posts on the video-sharing platform TikTok, which is popular with teenagers and young adults.  The posts came days after President Joe Biden signed an executive order that said Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, a federal civil rights law, prevents discrimination based on sex and gender identity. ""Every person should be treated with respect and dignity and should be able to live without fear, no matter who they are or whom they love,"" the order says. ""Children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports."" While the order itself did not change policies for public school districts, it signaled a departure from the Trump administration’s position that schools may exclude students from athletic teams based on their identities. In response, several state legislatures introduced bills that would prohibit transgender students from being part of teams that don’t match their sex assigned at birth. (Screenshot from TikTok) The viral TikTok posts contain a hint of truth about this legislation, but their primary claim is misleading. Congress and state legislatures — not schools — have introduced bills targeting transgender student-athletes. None of the pending legislation would force teachers to examine students’ genitalia. Some bills would open up the possibility for doctors to examine students before they can participate in sports. Lawmakers in at least 17 states are considering legislation that would limit opportunities for transgender student-athletes, according to a tally from the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy organization.  Cathryn Oakley, state legislative director and senior counsel for the HRC, has been tracking those bills. She said the TikTok posts leave out some key details. ""None of them require a teacher to do a physical examination for a student,"" Oakley said. ""However, several of them would require that a student would undergo a physical examination by a doctor — and that doctor would have to attest that they've done a variety of different things. In some of the states, it’s really invasive, gruesome testing."" As an example, Oakley pointed to a passed Idaho law that banned transgender women and girls from participating in women’s sports. (The law is currently not being enforced as it undergoes a legal challenge.)  ""If disputed, a student may establish sex by presenting a signed physician's statement that shall indicate the student's sex based solely on: (a) The student's internal and external reproductive anatomy; (b) The student's normal endogenously produced levels of testosterone; and (c) An analysis of the student's genetic makeup,"" the March 2020 law said. In an April 2020 lawsuit, the American Civil Liberties Union argued that the Idaho law ""discriminates on the basis of sex and transgender status"" and the doctor’s examinations would ""intrude upon the privacy and bodily autonomy of all women and girls engaged in student athletics."" The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Lindsay Hecox, a transgender woman who wanted to run cross-country at Boise State University. In August, a federal judge blocked the law, saying the ACLU was ""likely to succeed in establishing the Act is unconstitutional as currently written."" The law now awaits legal review in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Meanwhile, several other states — including neighboring Montana and Utah — are trying to pass their own versions of the Idaho law. RELATED: Biden signs executive order banning discrimination against transgender service members And in Congress, Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla., recently reintroduced a bill that would require schools to interpret Title IX to recognize student-athletes based on their sex assigned at birth. ""The bill does not say anything about physical exams — it is based on what was determined at birth,"" said Carson Steelman, Steube’s communications director. ""Genetics at birth is shown on an original birth certificate."" (Some states, however, allow transgender individuals to change the sex listed on their birth certificate.) While some proposals, including legislation in Iowa and Georgia, contain specific provisions about doctors’ exams, we could find no evidence that lawmakers are pushing for teachers to examine transgender students. Utah state Rep. Kera Birkeland, a Republican, said ""the physical required for sports participation will not change at all"" under her bill. Several TikTok posts say ""schools are trying to make a law that teachers can see girls' private parts to make sure they're not trans."" That claim is a misunderstanding of how some states are trying to legislate against transgender students.

Some of those bills would require doctor’s exams, but none of them say teachers would examine students’ genitalia.

Prominent public figures from state Senate Republican Leader Shannon Grove to former San Francisco Giants baseball player Aubrey Huff to some Democratic state lawmakers have spoken out against the bill, though their statements do not go so far as to describe the bill as legalizing sex with minors. With so many claims swirling, we decided to check the facts.  The Facts About SB 145 Current state allows a judge to decide whether to place a young man convicted of statutory rape, in which vaginal intercourse takes place with a minor, on the sex offender registry based on the facts of the case.  There is no such discretion when the offense includes anal or oral sex.  SB 145 would eliminate automatic sex-offeder registration for young adults who are convicted of having voluntary anal or oral sex with a minor. Instead, a judge would make the decision, as with cases involving vaginal intercourse. The law would not apply in cases where a one party does not believe the sexual contact was voluntary. LGBTQ advocates, including the bill’s author state Sen. Scott Wiener (D–San Francisco), say it would do away with a discriminatory law, one that’s a relic of a penal code that criminalized those acts until 1975, even between consenting adults.  ""This distinction in the law is irrational and discriminatory towards LGBTQ youth,"" Wiener said in a fact sheet on the law produced by his office, Equality California and the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office, all of which support the bill. ""SB 145 ends this irrational distinction by treating all sex the same way that the law currently treats penile-vaginal intercourse."" Decades ago, police used the fact that certain sex acts were illegal to raid gay clubs and charge people with crimes, said Asm.

Kamlager said the disparity in the law was ""put in place during a more conservative time in California and historically these [police raids] were done systematically to target folks to remove people who identified as being LGBT from our society."" Sex With A Minor Remains Illegal, In All Cases, Under SB 145 Some of the claims on social media say the bill protects rapists or lessens penalties for statutory rape. That’s not the case.  Nothing in the legislation would change penalties for statutory rape, which prosecutors in California can charge as either a misdemeanor or felony. It is illegal under current law for any adult to have any type of sex with a minor and that remains illegal under SB 145.  Also, the bill does not apply to any sex offenders convicted of forcible rape.  The legislation is supported by the California Coalition Against Sexual Assault and by law enforcement groups such as the California Police Chiefs Association and the California District Attorney’s Association. Claim About A 21-Year-Old Having Sex With An 11-Year-Old The second part of the Facebook post that we fact-checked claims, ""Now a 21 year old can have sex with an 11 year old, and not be listed on the sex registry as a sex offender."" That’s also wrong.  SB 145 only applies to young people ages 14, 15, 16 or 17 and any offender within a 10 year age range. ""The vast, vast majority of cases where a judge may decide NOT to put someone on the registry will be cases where the age range is close,"" the bill’s fact sheet estimates. ""At the end of the day, a judge will have full discretion to place someone on the registry, and a prosecutor can seek it."" Our Rating A widely-shared Facebook post claimed California had legalized ""pedophilia,"" and that ""Now a 21 year old can have sex with an 11 year old, and not be listed on the sex registry as a sex offender.""  That post and many like it are simply wrong.  They grossly distort the proposals in state SB 145, which aims to eliminate a disparity in how LGBTQ young people are treated on California’s sex offender registry.  The legislation would eliminate automatic sex offeder registration for young adults who are convicted of having voluntary anal or oral sex with a minor and are within 10 years of age of the victim. Instead, a judge would make that decision, just as existing law allows judges to decide whether to place offenders in cases involving vaginal intercourse on the registry. The bill would not, in any fashion, make it legal for any adult to have any type of sex with a minor. The only change involves giving a judge discretion over whether to list an offender on the sex registry for certain sex acts",False Pants on Fire,"September 2, 2020"
Photo shows Bernie Sanders at the 1969 Stonewall riots.,"Some Instagram users are misrepresenting an old meme to try and make Sen. Bernie Sanders look like a gay icon. A post published Feb. 14 by @indiesauce claims to show the Democratic presidential candidate at the June 1969 Stonewall riots. It depicts a man in a black turtleneck standing alongside four women. (Screenshot from Instagram) The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.) It has more than 7,700 likes. The Stonewall uprising was a series of confrontations between police and LGBTQ people outside the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in New York City. It is viewed as the catalyst for the modern gay rights movement and the reason that Pride celebrations are typically held in June. No one knows who threw the first brick at Stonewall, but it definitely wasn’t Sanders. The Instagram photo does not depict the Vermont senator, nor does it depict the Stonewall riots — it’s a meme that’s been around since at least 2015. It originally served as a way to make fun of hipsters and Tumblr users. via MEME Sanders is no stranger to protests, though; he was arrested in 1963 during a civil rights demonstration in Chicago. He also has a history of advocating for gay rights. But there’s no evidence that Sanders was at the Stonewall riots. The Instagram post is inaccurate",False,"February 18, 2020"
"Says justices of the peace in Texas are being asked to choose: ""give up your career or violate your religious beliefs"" and perform same-sex marriages.","During an interview on a Fort Worth radio program with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, host Chris Salcedo pressed his guest about the case of a Waco justice of the peace who was sanctioned by a state commission earlier this month for only officiating opposite sex, but not same-sex, marriages. The State Commission on Judicial Conduct issued Justice of the Peace Dianne Hensley a public warning over her refusal to perform same-sex ceremonies; the commission could take further action if she refuses to stop the practice. Paxton, a Republican, reiterated the stance of his office, one that has not changed since just after the 2015 Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage. He said people are entitled to religious exemptions when it would violate their faith to carry out the duties of their job. On the show, Salcedo characterized the case as such: ""I shouldn’t have to give up my career — make a choice, either give up your career or violate your religious beliefs,"" Salcedo said. ""The government shouldn’t put me in that position."" Saledo’s description of Hensely’s situation is inaccurate. No one is asking Hensley to violate her religious beliefs to keep her career: officiating marriages is an optional activity. A state commission’s opinion on the matter suggested she could officiate all or no marriages, but not selectively choose one type. Protection of religious beliefs Justices of the peace handle low-level civil and criminal cases, including traffic and other Class C misdemeanor cases and civil cases involving up to $10,000. They can also officiate marriages, but this is considered ""extra-judicial,"" an optional activity that earns them thousands per year in personal income. So while there may be some financial incentive to do it, it is by no means required.  In fact, some justices of the peace in Texas have chosen not to officiate any marriages in order to avoid the religious dilemma, including in McLennan County, where Hensley hails. The commission decided to investigate Hensley based at least in part on a Waco Herald-Tribune article in which she was quoted about her decision to decline same-sex marriages and how she believed she was entitled to a religious accommodation. It found that she had refused to perform same-sex marriages since 2016, instead only performing opposite-sex marriages and referring same-sex couples to other officiating JPs and clergy. The state commission that sanctioned Hensley said her actions cast ""doubt on her capacity to act impartially to persons appearing before her as a judge due to the person’s sexual orientation."" Now, Hensley can appeal the sanction, start performing same-sex marriages or stop performing marriages altogether. Hensley has argued that she is entitled to a ""religious exemption,"" but there is no law or legal precedent in Texas establishing such an exemption for a justice of the peace in this context. This question varies by state, depending on whether the state’s Supreme Court has taken up a case and established a precedent.  In separate interviews, Douglas Laycock and John Dzienkowski, law professors at the University of Texas, said they weren’t aware of any such cases in Texas.  Two legal opinions on the subject that have been issued by state agencies — a 2015 opinion from the attorney general’s office and the Judicial Commission sanction — are nonbinding. In a 2015 opinion filed after the U.S. Supreme Court case on same-sex marriage, Paxton supported people’s right to assert a religious exemption under the First Amendment, though he noted that fines and litigation were possible. The recent Judicial Commission opinion punished Henlsey for giving off the appearance of bias, seeming to indicate an exemption would not be possible. But Laycock said neither document is legally binding. ""The basic answer is we don’t know yet,"" Laycock said. ""This may well wind up in the courts."" Some states, such as North Carolina, have passed laws on this subject, but Texas has not.  The North Carolina law allows some officials, similar to a justice of the peace, to decline to administer any marriages if they have a ""sincerely held religious objection"" to same-sex marriage, but they may not be selective and only marry opposite-sex couples. Other positions have different requirements People in other government positions, like county clerks who issue marriage licenses, have less flexibility, as issuing marriage licenses can be part of their job description.  Perhaps most famously, Kim Davis, a clerk in Kentucky, refused to issue a license to a same-sex couple and, in a high-profile case, she was sued. When she refused to comply with the judge’s order compelling her to follow the law, she was jailed for six days for being in contempt of court. Davis was later released after agreeing not to interfere with other clerks in the office issuing licenses. Some county clerks in Texas are allowing those officials who object to same-sex marriage to find another clerk within the office to issue a license in their place. But if everyone else in the office also refuses, the office as a whole can’t deny a couple the right to marry in defiance of the law, Laycock said. That may explain why no religious exemption case has risen to the Supreme Court level in Texas, Laycock said. As long as the couple receives their license or has their marriage officiated, the damages they can claim in court are limited to emotional distress. That someone in Hensley’s position should not be forced to choose between their job and religious belief, as Salcedo commented, is ""not a settled rule of law yet; it’s an opinion about what the law ought to be,"" Laycock said. Our ruling Salcedo said justices of the peace like Hensley are being asked to choose: ""give up your career or violate your religious beliefs."" Justices of the peace are not required to officiate marriages and do so mainly for their own benefit, not as an integral duty of the job. Clerks, on occasion, may not have the luxury of that choice, but that is not what Salcedo called out in the statement. Plus, there hasn’t been an authoritative ruling in Texas on either situation",False,"December 17, 2019"
"Says Chick-fil-A funds the National Christian Foundation, which ""paid a preacher to go to Uganda and help their lawmakers"" with a bill that would impose the death penalty for homosexuality.","Some Facebook users are implicating Chick-fil-A in a Ugandan bill that would impose the death penalty for gay sex. ""Today Uganda announced a bill to legalize murdering gay people,"" reads one popular post, which was published Oct. 14. ""National Christian Organization paid a preacher to go to Uganda and help their lawmakers with the bill. Chick-fil-a (sic) funds National Christian Org."" ""If you eat at Chick-fil-a, this is what your money goes to."" The post, which is a screenshot of a tweet, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post refers to a bill in Uganda, where homosexuality is already illegal, that would punish gay sex with death. The bill was nullified five years ago on a technicality, but lawmakers have announced plans to revive it. In essence, the post is claiming that Chick-fil-A’s charitable contributions have been used to promote the death penalty for gay people in Uganda. Similar claims about the fried chicken chain and the Uganda bill have been shared thousands of times, so we wanted to check it out. Here’s what we found: • The nonprofit the Facebook post is referencing is the National Christian Foundation. • The preacher mentioned in the post did travel to Uganda around the time lawmakers were debating an anti-LGBTQ bill, but there’s no evidence he helped craft it. • The foundation run by Chick-fil-A’s owners has donated to the National Christian Foundation in the past, but it doesn’t currently. An American evangelical preacher supported by the National Christian Foundation did travel to Uganda in 2010, the same year the country was debating an anti-LGBTQ bill. But Colorado-based preacher Lou Engle didn’t ""help their lawmakers with the bill,"" as the Facebook post claims. Let’s focus first on what Engle did or didn’t do while in Uganda. Engle is the co-founder of TheCall Ministries, a defunct evangelical Christian group known for anti-LGBTQ views. It aimed to start ""a John the Baptist type movement to fast and pray in preparation for a 3rd great awakening."" In 2010, Engle traveled to Kampala, Uganda, to be the guest of honor at a Sunday prayer and rally about ""homosexuality, witchcraft, corruption and the fear of violence leading up to the country’s presidential election next year,"" the New York Times reported. Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni signs a new anti-gay bill that sets harsh penalties for homosexual sex, in Entebbe, Uganda Monday, Feb. 24, 2014. (AP) At the time, Ugandan lawmakers were debating a bill that broadened the criminalization of homosexuality and imposed the death penalty. A different version of the bill, which imposed life sentences instead of the death penalty, was signed into law in 2014, resulting in sanctions from the United States and other countries. A court annulled it later that year due to a legislative technicality. Engle was not directly linked to the legislation in Uganda, and he issued a statement ahead of his rally condemning the bill’s harsh penalties for homosexuality. However, during his rally in Kampala, Engle did praise the country’s ""courage"" and ""righteousness"" in pursuing the bill, the Times reported. The National Christian Foundation is a Georgia-based religious nonprofit and one of the largest charities in the United States. It was founded in 1982 by tax attorney Terry Parker, financial adviser Ron Blue and evangelical Christian author Larry Burkett. The National Christian Foundation gave TheCall $500 in 2009 and $300 in 2010, according to the group’s public tax documents. In 2008, TheCall received a much larger donation from the foundation — more than $160,000. It’s unclear to what extent those donations were explicitly for traveling to Uganda, if at all. TheCall announced it was closing sometime in 2018, according to the Wayback Machine. A 2012 investigation from the Atlantic found that, in 2008, the National Christian Foundation gave money to Ed Silvoso, a minister who founded a fundamentalist group called Harvest Evangelism, to work with a Ugandan bishop advocating for legislation imposing the death penalty for gay sex. Chick-fil-A did not support Uganda’s anti-gay bill, and connecting the company to it requires several steps. Most of the company and its owners’ charitable giving is conducted through two nonprofit foundations: the Chick-fil-A Foundation and the WinShape Foundation. The former was created by the company in 2012 and the latter was founded by the Cathy family 1984. Public tax records show the Chick-fil-A Foundation has not contributed money to the National Christian Foundation. However, the reverse is true — the National Christian Foundation gave the Chick-fil-A Foundation hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2014 and 2015. The WinShape Foundation’s tax records paint a different picture. We analyzed the foundation’s returns dating back to 2009, when the National Christian Foundation was donating to Engle’s TheCall. We found that WinShape’s contributions to the National Christian Foundation totaled $240,000 in 2009 and $247,500 in both 2010 and 2011. The National Christian Foundation has also donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to WinShape over the past decade. We asked Chick-fil-A and the WinShape Foundation why they passed money back and forth over the years. WinShape didn’t respond, and the company didn’t comment on the tax returns. ""The WinShape Foundation is a private family organization. The Chick-fil-A Foundation is the official philanthropic arm of Chick-fil-A, Inc.,"" the spokesperson said. ""Chick-fil-A has not supported legislative campaigns of any kind in Uganda."" The National Christian Foundation has a track record of donating to anti-LGBTQ groups, such as the Alliance Defending Freedom and the Family Research Council. The former has supported sterilizing transgender people while the latter has defended the discredited practice of conversion therapy. In 2012, following comments from Chick-fil-A CEO Dan Cathy opposing same-sex marriage, Chick-fil-A said it would ""leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the government and political arena."" But 2017 tax documents from the company and its owners’ foundations show it still donates to organizations with negative views of homosexuality, including the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and the Paul Anderson Youth Home. A Facebook post of a tweet claimed that Chick-fil-A has contributed to the National Christian Foundation, which then funded a preacher to travel to Uganda to help lawmakers craft an anti-gay bill. News reports show that the evangelical preacher Lou Engle did travel to Uganda in 2010, around the time that lawmakers were crafting a bill that would have imposed the death penalty for gay sex. However, Engle did not directly contribute to the legislation. While he complimented Ugandans for their stance against homosexuality, he denounced the harsh penalties proposed in the bill. Federal tax returns show that the National Christian Foundation contributed to Engle’s evangelical Christian group in 2009, before his trip. Documents also show that the WinShape Foundation, which is run by Chick-fil-A’s owners, donated to the National Christian Foundation in 2009, but the link between the company and Uganda’s anti-gay legislation is weak.

"""The majority of Americans across ALL parties favor these nondiscrimination policies for LGBTQ people (liberals at 81%, moderates at 76% and conservatives at 55%).""","Taylor Swift has 118 million followers on Instagram, the photo and video sharing app. Nearly 850,000 of them liked a letter she posted there supporting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people. The letter, which drew national news coverage, was to Republican Lamar Alexander, one of the U.S. senators from Swift’s home state of Tennessee. She asked him to vote for the federal Equality Act, which would ban discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation and gender identity. Then she wrote: ""A recent study shows that over 64 percent of Tennesseeans support laws for protection of LGBTQ people against discrimination. Reports are that the majority of Americans across ALL parties favor these nondiscrimination policies for LGBTQ people (liberals at 81%, moderates at 76% and conservatives at 55%)."" We wondered if, on a national level, LGBTQ support is as strong as Swift says it is. Swift relies on a poll done by PRRI (Public Religion Research Institute), a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit. It’s the most recent poll we found that’s on point. Polling was done in 40,000 landline and cellphone interviews from March 2018 through December 2018 under the supervision of Pennsylvania-based SSRS, a survey research firm. Several polling experts told us that PRRI specializes in polling in this topic area and that PRRI and SSRS do solid work. The key question was: ""Do you strongly favor, favor, oppose or strongly oppose laws that would protect gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people against discrimination in jobs, public accommodations and housing?"" In releasing the poll results in March 2019, PRRI said: ""Majorities of Democrats (79%), independents (70%) and Republicans (56%) say they favor laws that would shield LGBT people from various kinds of discrimination. … Majorities of liberals (81%), moderates (76%) and conservatives (55%) all favor nondiscrimination protections for LGBT people."" So, based on the poll, Swift is correct in saying that majorities of Democrats, independents and Republicans support nondiscrimination protections for LGBT people, at least when it comes to jobs, public accommodations and housing. And she accurately cites figures for liberals, moderates and conservatives. (The polling did not ask about queer people — the ""Q"" part of Swift’s statement. The Human Rights Campaign says that regarding gender, queer people ""may see themselves as being both male and female, neither male nor female or as falling completely outside these categories."") ""Americans generally do not want to discriminate, so the results aren’t surprising,"" American Enterprise Institute senior fellow and polling expert Karlyn Bowman told us. ""That’s not the same thing, of course, as supporting a particular policy or behavior."" We did find some other recent polls that asked more specific questions, with varying results when it comes to Republicans. A Quinnipiac University poll released in May 2019 found that the vast majority of Republicans, Democrats and independents said employers should not be allowed to fire someone based on their sexual orientation or sexual identity. But a PRRI poll released in June 2018 found that a majority of Republicans favor allowing business owners to claim religious exemptions from serving gay and lesbian customers. ""Firing someone based on orientation is clearly unacceptable to nearly everyone,"" said Kathleen Weldon, director of data operations and communications at the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at Cornell University. ""Other sorts of laws might not be perceived as discrimination, allowing some people to support the principle of nondiscrimination protections, but not support some specific policies."" The Equality Act pushed by Swift would ban discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation and gender identity in areas including public accommodations and facilities, education, federal funding, employment, housing, credit and the jury system. It was approved in May 2019 by the U.S. House of Representatives, which is controlled by Democrats. But the Washington Post reported that the measure is unlikely to get a vote in the Republican-led Senate, and that the White House has signaled that President Donald Trump would veto the measure if it ever reached his desk. Swift says: ""The majority of Americans across all parties support these nondiscrimination policies for LGBTQ people (liberals at 81%, moderates at 76% and conservatives at 55%)."" Swift accurately describes the results of the latest poll we found that’s on point, which asked about support for laws that would protect gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people against discrimination in jobs, public accommodations and housing. She made the statement in seeking support for a federal bill that would prohibit discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation and gender identity, and the poll did not ask about that bill",Mostly True,"June 5, 2019"
"""California to teach kindergarteners there are 15 genders.""","Conservative critics have pounced on a new health guidance in California schools about gender. ""California to teach kindergarteners there are 15 genders,"" states the text on a Facebook video created by the Freedom Project Media’s Dr. Duke Show, a podcast that focuses on education. The show features University of Wisconsin Oshkosh English professor Duke Pesta, who describes himself as an education reformer. ""The state of California is now moving to mandate that kindergarten teachers teach 5-year-olds 15 different genders in every single California kindergarten school,"" Pesta says. The post has been circulating since Freedom Project Media first posted it in January. One video we found, shared by another group May 28, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found the video’s claim outdated and misleading. Duke’s video stems from the California Department of Education’s health education curriculum framework, which provides guidance for K-12 school districts. In 2018, the department released draft revisions and opened it up for public comment. Hundreds of pages long, the document provides guidance on many health topics, such as nutrition and physical activity, injury prevention, alcohol and drugs, and yes, gender. While the LGBTQ community praised the new recommendations, sections on sex education and gender drew some criticism. Pesta’s video, for instance, zeroed in on a section about gender lessons for kindergarteners through third graders. But it does not interpret the guidance correctly. The framework states that many children have encountered gender stereotypes by kindergarten. ""The goal is not to cause confusion about the gender of the child but to develop an awareness that other expressions exist,"" the framework states. The framework suggests lessons and activities, such as showing images of children who don’t conform to stereotypes and inviting adults who might be a stay-at-home dad or a female firefighter to visit the classroom. The lessons are intended to dispel myths and link families with resources to help prevent bullying. The document mentions several books that can help, and The Dr. Duke Show focused on one in particular. The book, titled, ""Who Are You?: The Kids Guide to Gender Identity,"" reads: ""Some people say there are only two genders. But there are really many genders. I am … girl boy both neither just me! You are who you say you are, because YOU know best. For some people, the grown-ups guessed right about their body and their gender. This is called cisgender — when someone’s identity matches their sex assigned at birth. And for some people, there are more than just two choices. These are just a few words people use: trans, genderqueer, non-binary, gender fluid, transgender, gender neutral, agender, neutrois, bigender, third gender, two-spirit … and there are even more words people are using to describe their experience. This is called the gender spectrum."" Melina Sevlever, a psychologist with the Columbia Gender Identity Program, said there are actually more than 15 terms to describe gender identity, and some overlap. The suggested book idea didn’t last. On May 8, following objections by some parents about the sex education or gender lessons, the State Board of Education removed several recommended books about sex or gender, including ""Who Are You?"" While the book is still mentioned in the framework document from April, a spokesman for the state Department of Education told us that it will add a disclaimer stating that it is in the process of revisions expected in a couple of months. But even when the book was included in the document, there was nothing stated suggesting it was a mandatory lesson for kindergarteners statewide. That wasn’t the point. The book was mentioned as a potential resource that could be shared with parents and caretakers: ""Parents, guardians, or caretakers receive a handout with suggestions on how to initiate a conversation on growth and development with their child. Books such as It’s Not the Stork! A Book About Girls, Boys, Babies, Bodies, Families and Friends by Robie H. Harris (2008) or Who Are You?: The Kids Guide to Gender Identity by Brook Pessin‐Whedbee (2017) can be shared together."" Freedom Project Media went further than the draft suggested reading list, writing that the gender lesson was mandatory and pointing to the state policy that parents can’t opt their children out of programs about gender identity. But that isn’t right either. Under the California Healthy Youth Act, parents can opt out of sex education. The law doesn’t provide a way for parents to opt out of general instruction related to LGBTQ people if the lesson itself does not fall under the umbrella of sex education, which is education about sexual activity itself. For example, a lesson on Harvey Milk, who was California’s first openly gay elected official, would not be described as sex ed. A video Facebook post said, ""California to teach kindergarteners there are 15 genders."" The recently shared video from January criticized California’s draft health curriculum framework. At the time, the state document included some recommended books for parents including ""Who Are You?: The Kids Guide to Gender Identity."" The book listed various gender identity terms. But it was not included in the state guidance as a mandatory lesson for teachers of all kindergarten students in California. The controversy is also out of date, which some Facebook groups may not know about. On May 8, the California Board of Education decided to remove the book, among others, and the state is in the process of updating the document that lists the book",False,"May 31, 2019"
"29 states still don’t have ""comprehensive protections"" for people in the LGBTQ community.","Congressional Democrats recently introduced the Equality Act, a bill aimed at expanding existing civil rights legislation to ban discrimination against LGBTQ people in employment, housing, education, credit and other aspects of life. In arguing for the measure, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin noted that in much of the country there is little legal protection for such individuals. Baldwin was the first openly gay member of the Senate. In 2018, U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona became the first bisexual member. The two are the body’s only LGBTQ members. ""The Equality Act recognizes the fact that more than half of the states in the United States do not have legal protections for people preventing or giving them the tools to fight back against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity,"" Baldwin told Jonathan Van Ness on the March 12, 2019 episode of his ""Getting Curious"" podcast. Specifically, Baldwin claimed that 29 states lack ""comprehensive protections"" for LGBTQ individuals. In 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that bans on gay marriage were unconstitutional. And Wisconsin has included protections from discrimination against sex and sexual orientation since 1982, becoming the first state to enact these laws. (Wisconsin did not go as far to fully protect transgender people, as PolitiFact Wisconsin found in 2015.) Is Baldwin right about other states?
  The Equality Act proposal The Equality Act was first introduced in the House in 2015 and is an updated version of one introduced in 1974, which aimed to extend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prohibit discrimination on the account of ""sex, marital status, or sexual orientation in places of public accommodation."" The new version extends the 1974 law to add gender identity, defining it ""as gender-related identity, appearance, mannerisms, or characteristics, regardless of the individual’s designated sex at birth,"" which would include transgender individuals. The places where discrimination is specifically prohibited are also extended, adding in gyms, stores, banks, travel agencies and more. Supporters of the measure say it’s a step toward full equality for the LGBTQ community, while some conservative opponents say the bill is a threat to religious liberty and free speech -- particularly for those who choose to run businesses in accordance with their religious beliefs. The state of the states As of today, 21 states and Washington D.C. have laws that prohibit discrimination against sexual orientation and gender identity, according to Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit advocacy group for equal rights. The group compiled its data from existing state statutes. Wisconsin prohibits sexual orientation discrimination but doesn’t go as far to address gender identity. Thus, it is not counted among the 21. Of course, if 21 states have such protections, then 29 would not. ""Currently, federal anti-discrimination statutes such as Title VII (Civil Rights Act of 1964) which prohibits discrimination in the employment context do not on their face prohibit sexual orientation or gender identity discrimination,"" said Adam Romero, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law. ""The statutes don't say the words sexual orientation or gender identity."" Thus, as it stands, LGBTQ individuals living in states that have anti-discrimination laws have stronger civil rights protections than those who don’t. Some may also be covered by city or county ordinances that prohibit discrimination. Indeed, those living in states without such provisions face even less protection. ""If you live in California, you have protections from employment discrimination or Nevada or New Mexico and these other states,"" Romero said. ""But, if you live in Texas or Oklahoma or Florida, or the many other states without these state statutes, you are not protected under state law from discrimination (based on) sexual orientation or gender identity under these state statutes. ""The Equality Act would benefit all LGBTQ people across the country but it would be especially beneficial to those living in states without state level protections.""

Here, we look at whether Blackburn in fact voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. Blackburn did vote against the bill, but she voted in favor of a Republican alternative. The differences were not great, but they hung on the very issue of gender orientation that Swift wrote about. The Violence Against Women Act was two decades old in 2013 when Congress wrestled with renewing the funds to support it. The law paid for programs to prevent domestic violence. It provided money to investigate and prosecute rape and other crimes against women. It supported counseling for victims. The $630 million price tag was less the problem than some specific language on non-discrimination. The Senate approved its bill first on Feb. 12, 2013, by a wide bipartisan margin of 78 to 22. That measure redefined underserved populations to include those who might be discriminated against based on religion, sexual orientation or gender identity. There were also changes in the recognition of the authority of Native American tribes to enforce the law within the tribal justice system. When the bill came over to the House, a key sticking point had to do with orientation and identity. House Republicans crafted a version of the legislation that omitted the sexual orientation and gender protections. The American Bar Association opposed the GOP version, saying ""the House substitute eliminates certain critical improvements."" Domestic violence shelters in some southern states said they had heard from governors’ offices that they couldn’t use federal funds for LGBTQ victims because the law didn’t explicitly say they were covered. ""You show up bleeding at the door and we’re going to address the bleeding, not stop to ask about your sexual orientation or gender identity first,"" said Ruth Glenn, CEO of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. ""We didn’t want programs to lose their funding because they didn’t do triage on that basis."" The House Republican version failed by a vote of 166 to 257. The nay votes included 60 Republicans. Blackburn voted in favor of the Republican measure. The Senate version, the one that ultimately became law, came up next and passed 286 to 138. The bill had picked up 27 additional Republican votes. Blackburn voted no. We reached out to Blackburn’s office for comment and did not hear back. Swift said Blackburn voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. Blackburn voted no on the final version that became law. She did vote for a Republican alternative that lacked discrimination protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity. While there were other issues, over two dozen Republicans decided that it was better to fund the act than to continue to oppose the nondiscrimination provisions. Blackburn was not one of them",Mostly True,"October 9, 2018"
"Says ""we know"" Erika Harold would ""discriminate against a loving gay couple who want to adopt a child, favoring an abusive straight couple instead.""","In his bid to become Illinois attorney general, Democratic state Sen. Kwame Raoul has sought to cast Republican opponent Erika Harold as too extreme. To that end, he’s run three ads centered on the stance Harold allegedly took against gay adoption in 2000 as a 19-year-old Miss Illinois contestant during a closed-door interview session. ""You still won’t believe what Erika Harold believes,"" a narrator says in his latest one. ""We know she'd discriminate against a loving gay couple who want to adopt a child, favoring an abusive straight couple instead."" ""She also supports a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage and would even allow employers to fire workers just for being gay,"" the narrator goes on to say. While those claims also warrant examination, we decided to focus this fact-check on the ad’s first contention because it has become the central focus of Raoul’s argument that Harold’s views are extreme. What’s more, Harold publicly declared months ago that she supports gay adoption and foster parenting, undercutting Raoul’s claim that ""we know"" Harold ""believes"" (present-tense) in discriminating against gay couples looking to offer children a home. The allegations on which his claim is based come from a March report by NBC 5 that quoted unnamed pageant officials who recounted the interview session: One of the questions to Harold that year was: If she, like her mother, was responsible to place a child in foster care and had to choose between a.) A loving gay couple or b.) A heterosexual couple who were known child abusers, which would she chose? All three sources told NBC 5 she chose the child abusers. After repeated requests for comment, NBC 5 reported, Harold’s campaign responded with a statement saying she did not recall the exchange but ""certainly support[s] same-sex adoption and foster care placement."" That’s the same position Harold herself took in multiple media appearances following the story’s release. ""I don't remember the specific exchange that was alleged by the anonymous sources,"" Harold said in an interview with ABC 7 the week after the story ran. ""What I do remember is that at the time I would not have supported same-sex adoption, but what I want to make very clear is my position today, which is I strongly support same-sex adoption and same-sex foster parenting."" We asked Raoul’s spokeswoman Aviva Bowen to explain how they know for a fact Harold believes otherwise, but Bowen did not provide any evidence that answered our question. Instead, Bowen wrote in an email that Harold’s ""‘evolution’ is not credible."" ""Her statement: 1. comes only after pressed several times by media when the story was becoming public and 2. conveniently contradicts all of her other anti-LGBT views,"" Bowen added, pointing to Harold’s responses in a candidate survey from the socially conservative Illinois Family Institute, which she filled when running unsuccessfully for the U.S. House in 2014. The questionnaire Bowen referred to asked Harold and other candidates for office about federal legislation important to social conservatives, including gay marriage. Harold’s answers indicated she supported defining marriage as between a man and woman. For the record, a spokesman for Harold said she no longer supports a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage in light of the Supreme Court’s 2015 ruling legalizing it. The campaign also says Harold backs the Illinois Human Rights Act, which prohibits employers other than religious institutions from discriminating against an individual for their sexual orientation or identity. ""It’s entirely reasonable and common for elected officials to evolve and change their positions on these issues,"" Harold spokesman Aaron DeGroot wrote in an email, pointing to language used by former President Barack Obama when he embraced gay marriage after previously opposing it. Raoul’s ad says, ""we know"" Erika Harold would ""discriminate against a loving gay couple who want to adopt a child, favoring an abusive straight couple instead."" That attack refers to something Harold allegedly said nearly two decades ago as a 19-year-old Miss Illinois contestant, according to an NBC 5 report. But the sources who said she took that stance remain unnamed and no one has yet come forward publicly or produced further evidence the comments were made. What’s more, since the NBC story ran in March, Harold has stated repeatedly that although she doesn't recall the long ago exchange, she now ""strongly"" supports same-sex adoption and fostering. That refutes Raoul’s claim that ""we know"" she would discriminate against a gay couple looking to adopt",False,"September 17, 2018"

"""Republicans vote to make it legal nationwide to ban gays and lesbians from adopting.""","A story drawing eyeballs on social media said Republicans approved a measure that, if implemented, would allow child welfare providers to deny same-sex couples seeking to adopt. ""Republicans vote to make it legal nationwide to ban gays and lesbians from adopting,"" said a July 12, 2018, headline from LGBTQ Nation, an online magazine. The headline choice leaves out important details that could give readers the wrong impression. The amendment would not establish a nationwide ban making it impossible for same-sex couples to adopt. Instead, it would allow individual child welfare providers to create their own adoption criteria — a change that would increase the potential for discrimination against gays and lesbians but would not constitute an outright ban nationwide. And the reference to ""Republicans"" refers to one House committee. The proposal is not yet law.  Here's what happened. The U.S. House of Representatives Appropriations Committee voted on a measure related to adoption by same-sex couples July 11 during a markup of a funding bill for the departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., introduced an amendment prohibiting the federal government, or any state or local entity receiving federal funds, from taking action against child welfare providers that refuse to provide services to certain customers due to ""sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions."" If installed, the Aderholt amendment would enable child welfare providers to discriminate when recruiting adoptive parents, promoting and facilitating adoptions, and supporting adoptive families. In a public statement, Aderholt made specific reference to child welfare providers that turn down same-sex families hoping to adopt. ""Several states and localities across the country are not allowing religious organizations, such as Catholic Charities and Bethany Christian Services, to operate child welfare agencies,"" Aderholt said. ""The reason for this is simply because these organizations, based on religious conviction, choose not to place children with same-sex couples."" He added: ""The amendment I introduced seeks to prevent these governments from discriminating against child welfare providers on the basis that the provider declines to provide a service that conflicts with its sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions."" Aderholt’s amendment also includes language requiring HHS to withhold 15 percent of federal funds allocated for child welfare services from states and localities that do take action against providers that refuse services on the basis of religious beliefs. The amendment was approved by a vote of 29 to 23, with all 22 Democrats and one Republican voting to strike it. Several Democrats, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, have voiced disapproval for the amendment, calling it a ""license to discriminate."" Bil Browning, managing editor at LGBTQ Nation, said the amendment is part of a larger trend. ""This year alone, Kansas, Georgia and Oklahoma have passed legislation that would allow adoption agencies to discriminate against gay and lesbian couples,"" Browning said. ""In Kansas and Oklahoma, the Republican governors signed the legislation into law."" Still, the full funding bill will have to pass both the House and Senate and be signed by President Donald Trump before the amendment will enter into effect. Other headlines about what happened were more accurate. CNN wrote, for instance, ""Adoption agencies could refuse same-sex couples under measure OK'd by House panel."" A headline said, ""Republicans vote to make it legal nationwide to ban gays and lesbians from adopting."" The amendment is not an absolute ban on same-sex adoption, despite the headline's implication for casual readers. Republicans in a House committee approved an amendment that would make it illegal nationwide for states and localities to punish child welfare providers that refuse to place children with same-sex couples because of religious beliefs or moral convictions. But it has not yet been taken up by either chamber of Congress. Theoretically, the amendment would allow child welfare providers to implement official or de facto bans on same-sex adoption without fear of retribution. At the same time, states and localities could also choose to continue taking action against discriminating child welfare providers in spite of a 15 percent cut to their federal funding. LGBTQ Nation’s claim that the amendment would make it ""legal nationwide to ban gays and lesbians from adopting"" is therefore slightly misleading, because the full effect of the amendment would depend on the responses of individual states and localities, as well as the number of agencies that elect to discriminate in their provision of services",Half True,"July 24, 2018"
"""Starbucks CEO: ‘If You Support Traditional Marriage We Don’t Want Your Business’""","With his decision to step down as executive chairman of Starbucks, Howard Schultz has been in the news a lot lately, and one resurfacing headline would have readers believe he once told opponents of same-sex marriage that he did not want their business. But this is an uncorroborated quote that has been floating around the internet for years. ""Starbucks CEO: ‘If You Support Traditional Marriage We Don’t Want Your Business,"" said a February 2017 headline from My Christian Daily, which circulated social media last week. My Christian Daily is a project from Initiate Media, a Christian media company that ""seek(s) to make God famous,"" according to its ""About"" page. Similar stories have appeared on various websites since 2013. My Christian Daily cited an article from the Washington Press — a website that we were unable to find and may no longer exist — as well as an article from Forbes. Facebook users flagged this story as part of efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The story about Schultz said that during a 2013 annual meeting for Starbucks shareholders, Schultz received a complaint from Tom Strobhar, founder of The Corporate Morality Action Center, an organization with a mission to ""challenge companies that offend traditional moral norms"" such as ""the sacredness of marriage between a man and a woman."" Strobhar said he believed Starbucks lost revenue because of its public support for a 2012 same-sex marriage referendum, which in turn inspired boycotts from anti-gay-marriage groups, such as the National Organization for Marriage. The referendum asked voters if same-sex marriage should be legalized in the state of Washington, and Starbucks joined other leading Washington-area companies in supporting the measure. In response, the story went, Schultz told Strobhar to sell his Starbucks shares and invest in other companies. As it turns out, Schultz’s actual remarks were more nuanced, and we did not find any credible articles that quoted him saying he did not want business from opponents of same-sex marriage. Snopes debunked this falsehood years ago and updated its post on Sunday. Schultz said at the time that the decision to support same-sex marriage was about respecting diversity rather than maximizing revenue. ""Not every decision is an economic decision,"" Schultz said. ""Despite the fact that you recite statistics that are narrow in time, we did provide a 38 percent shareholder return over the last year. I don’t know how many things you invest in, but I would suspect not many things, companies, products, investments have returned 38 percent over the last 12 months."" He continued: ""Having said that, it is not an economic decision to me. The lens in which we are making that decision is through the lens of our people. We employ over 200,000 people in this company, and we want to embrace diversity of all kinds. If you feel, respectfully, that you can get a higher return than the 38 percent you got last year, it’s a free country. You can sell your shares in Starbucks and buy shares in another company."" Schultz’s 38 percent figure comes from fiscal year 2012, meaning the timeframe between October 2011 to September 2012. This return was down from the previous fiscal year, which saw a 46 percent shareholder return. (See a video of Schultz’s full response.) When the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015, Starbucks issued a statement applauding the decision and recalling Schultz’s exchange with Strobhar as ""the company’s most vocal statement on diversity and equality."" Reggie Borges, a spokesperson for Starbucks, said the My Christian Daily story is not accurate and pointed to the Snopes fact-check, a video of Schultz’s response and the statement released after 2015 Supreme Court ruling as evidence. My Christian Daily did not respond to a request for comment. A headline stated, ""Starbucks CEO: ‘If You Support Traditional Marriage We Don’t Want Your Business.’"" This is a claim that has circulated since 2013. At an annual meeting for company shareholders, Strobhar said the company’s support for same-sex marriage was eroding its bottom line, which prompted Schultz to defend his decision. Schultz said Strobhar was free to sell his Starbucks stocks and invest in another company if he believed the company’s social policies meant he could get a better return on his money elsewhere. He did not say opponents of same-sex marriage were not wanted as investors or as customers",False,"June 5, 2018"

Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found that the United States voted against a resolution that called for an overall ban on the death penalty, not a ban specific to gays and lesbians.

Donate to our Spring Campaign. Go on the record as saying facts matter! While the story said that the vote ""just"" took place, it actually happened several months ago. On Sept. 29, the UN Human Rights Council voted on a broad resolution about the death penalty. Among other things, the resolution condemned imposing the death penalty ""as a sanction for specific forms of conduct, such as apostasy, blasphemy, adultery and consensual same-sex relations, and expressing serious concern that the application of the death penalty for adultery is disproportionately imposed on women."" The resolution also stated that the Secretary General had found discriminatory use of the death penalty, including based on sexual orientation. The four-page resolution includes a long list of arguments against the death penalty, and said that states that have not abolished the death penalty should ""consider doing so."" The United States was one of 13 countries to vote against the resolution, while 27 nations voted in favor and seven abstained. (The story said that Trump took the vote, but technically U.S. voting decisions are reached through internal discussions involving senior officials.) The U.S. statement about the vote made no specific mention of same-sex individuals. Instead, it said that the United States opposed the resolution because the resolution advocated for the outright abolition of the death penalty. ""The United States is disappointed that it must vote against this resolution. As in previous years, we had hoped for a balanced and inclusive resolution that would better reflect the position of states that continue to apply the death penalty lawfully. We reaffirm our longstanding position on the legality of the death penalty, when imposed and carried out in a manner consistent with a state’s international obligations."" The Trump administration faced a barrage of negative headlines about the section of the resolution pertaining to people who are gay.   Days after the vote, U.S. State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert reiterated that the U.S. was against a broad condemnation of the death penalty, but also spoke up about the portion that pertained to people who are engaged in same-sex relations: ""The United States unequivocally condemns the application of the death penalty for conduct such as homosexuality, blasphemy, adultery, and apostasy. We do not consider such conduct appropriate for criminalization."" Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, also pushed back against the headlines. She tweeted Oct. 3: ""Fact: There was NO vote by USUN that supported the death penalty for gay people. We have always fought for justice for the LGBT community."" After Nauert’s statement, some gay rights activists remained critical of the vote. The Human Rights Campaign stated that it ""welcomes this clarification but continues to be concerned about the Trump/Pence administration’s engagement on the human rights of LGBTQ people abroad. It is disturbing that leadership in this administration did not discuss this position in their original explanation for the ""no"" vote."" According to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, as of 2017 there were six countries (eight if we count the parts of Syria and Iraq still occupied by ISIS) where the death penalty is implemented for same-sex relations. There were also five where it is technically allowed (if not actually invoked), and one where it has not yet been implemented. John Fisher, Geneva director of Human Rights Watch, an organization that opposes the death penalty, told PolitiFact that the United States made clear that it's vote against the resolution was not based on the reference to same-sex conduct. The United States has traditionally had issues with death penalty resolutions at UN forums, said Louis Charbonneau, the UN director at Human Rights Watch. ""HRC resolutions have political power in that they are expressions of a key collective body, the UN’s top human rights body,"" he said. ""But they’re not legally binding in the way that Security Council resolutions can be."" A headline by WashingtonSources said, ""Trump votes for death penalty for being gay."" In September, the United States voted against a four-page resolution about the death penalty that included a provision condemning the imposition of the death penalty as a sanction for ""consensual same-sex relations."" But the U.S. had another reason to vote against the resolution: The United States still uses the death penalty, and this resolution broadly condemned it. Days later, the State Department went on record stating that it ""unequivocally condemns the application of the death penalty for conduct such as homosexuality",False,"May 10, 2018"
"The North Carolina bathroom bill ""was really never repealed.""","It might seem like House Bill 2 – the controversial law that regulated transgender bathroom access – has been repealed and tossed into the annals of North Carolina’s political history. A new law, House Bill 142, was passed. The NCAA ended its boycott of the state. The NBA, which last year relocated its All-Star game from Charlotte to New Orleans upon passage of HB2, plans to hold the game in Charlotte in 2019. And protests that occurred in front of the governor’s mansion in Raleigh when former Gov. Pat McCrory was in office have dissipated. All this, McCrory contended in a recent interview with WBT radio in Charlotte, has happened despite the fact that HB2 ""was really never repealed,"" he says. HB2 is a touchy subject for McCrory, who faced immediate backlash from corporations, advocacy groups and sports organizations after signing it into law in spring 2016. Democrat Roy Cooper beat McCrory, a Republican, last November in a tight race where Cooper campaigned on the idea that state leaders should focus less on social issues and more on teacher pay and health care. McCrory told WBT that the media are biased because they haven’t reported that ""all of the restrictions that were in place last October are in place this October."" ""Nothing's changed, but it is one of the best kept secrets in the media and in politics,"" McCrory said. ""Everyone's pretending the problem's solved and we're going to move on,"" he continued. ""It was a fake issue in many ways all along, and this is one issue where it's fake news that a bill was signed and very little changed except for the public perception."" This is one subject where McCrory and some of his former adversaries in LGBT advocacy groups basically agree. Ben Graumann, communications director for Equality NC, referred to new law HB 142 as ""a continuation of HB2."" And Chris Sgro, communications director for the Human Rights Campaign, said HB 142 ""while purported to be a 'repeal' of  HB2, simply replaces one discriminatory anti-transgender bill with another."" So we wondered if McCrory was on to something. What didn’t change HB2 required people in schools and other government buildings to use the bathroom that corresponded with their birth certificate. The law also banned local governments from passing local laws that protect LGBT people from discrimination within their boundaries, and prevented governments from making local rules raising the minimum wage, requiring paid leave policies and more. Republicans had contended that HB2 protected safety and privacy in bathrooms by overriding a Charlotte ordinance that had allowed transgender people to use bathrooms matching their gender identity. On March 30, the legislature approved and Cooper signed HB 142, which removed HB2’s name from the books. The new law received bipartisan support in the legislature but harsh criticism from conservative Christian groups that said it endangered women and equal rights groups that said the bill didn’t go far enough. HB 142 repealed just one of four HB2 sections. The other three sections re-established modified versions of some of the most controversial parts of HB2. As PolitiFact’s promise-tracking Coop-O-Meter points out, HB 142 added back HB2's bans on local anti-discrimination ordinances, but gave them an expiration date: Dec. 1, 2020, after the next gubernatorial election. The new law left regulation of bathrooms, showers and changing facilities to state lawmakers, not the local school systems, universities, community colleges and other state agencies that had been setting their own policies. But, since the state steered clear of creating new regulations, the new bill creates ""widespread uncertainty about whether and where transgender people can use restrooms in government buildings,"" said Chris Brook, legal director for the ACLU of North Carolina. ""Asking if House Bill 2 is repealed doesn’t tell the whole story,"" Brook said. ""The more important question is, does North Carolina law continue to discriminate against LGBT people and transgender people in particular? And the answer is yes."" What changed The most controversial part of HB2, and the part that drew the most national attention, was the requirement that people in government facilities use the bathroom matching their birth certificate. The cornerstone of HB 142 was the elimination of that requirement. Rather than allow transgender people to use the bathroom matching their gender identity, North Carolina rejoined 48 other states that have no explicit law about bathroom access for transgender people. One state, Washington, has gone the other direction and explicitly allowed allowed transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender with which they identify. In a statement explaining its willingness to resume placing events in North Carolina, the NCAA said: ""We have been assured by the state that this new law allows the NCAA to enact its inclusive policies by contract with communities, universities, arenas, hotels, and other service providers that are doing business with us, our students, other participants, and fans. Further, outside of bathroom facilities, the new law allows our campuses to maintain their own policies against discrimination, including protecting LGBTQ rights, and allows cities’ existing nondiscrimination ordinances, including LBGTQ protections, to remain effective."" The new law dissolved a ban on cities and counties imposing anti-discrimination ordinances on their contractors. Norma Houston, a lecturer for the UNC School of Government, described the changes in a post on the Coates’ Canons blog. Can a city or county require a contractor to have an anti-discrimination policy relating to the contractor’s suppliers or subcontractors that includes nondiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, transgender, or gender identity? Pre-HB2: Yes HB2: No Post-HB2: Yes On Oct. 18, Cooper signed an executive order that aims to prohibit discrimination (on the basis of race, gender, National Guard or veteran status, sexual orientation or gender identity) in government agencies and by state contractors. ""Governor Cooper said when he signed HB 142 that it represented a first step and he will continue to work to provide non-discrimination protections for all North Carolinians,"" Cooper’s spokesman, Ford Porter, wrote.   Along with Josh Stein, the N.C. attorney general, Cooper also announced a proposed settlement that if approved by a judge would allow transgender people in North Carolina facilities run by the Cooper administration to use public restrooms and other facilities that match their gender identity. ""By taking these steps, North Carolina is sending a clear message to the world that we are a welcoming state that is open for business,"" he said. ""Claiming that no progress has been made is completely and objectively false."" The proposed settlement, known as a consent decree, was proposed and agreed upon by Cooper and challengers of the lawsuit ""because of the significant constitutional harms H.B.142 has caused transgender North Carolinians,"" the ACLU said in an email. ""If entered, the consent decree would alleviate some of the sweeping harms that vulnerable transgender North Carolinians suffered from the H.B. 2 and H.B. 142 saga."" It’s unclear whether the judge will approve the settlement. Our ruling McCrory said HB2 ""was really never repealed."" The bill named HB2 was indeed trashed and the most controversial part of it is gone. Advocates point out that parts of the repeal bill are still restrictive. But it’s incorrect to suggest, as McCrory did, that ""nothing’s changed",Mostly False,"November 22, 2017"
"""More than 15,000 transgender Americans"" are ""serving in the military today.""","An announcement by President Donald Trump on Twitter that the U.S. government ""will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. military"" drew an almost immediate denunciation from U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan. The Madison-area Democrat called the decision ""outrageous and shameful"" and ""based in discrimination"" in a news release issued July 26, 2017. He concluded by stating: ""With more than 15,000 transgender Americans serving in the military today, President Trump should immediately reverse course on his decision and he should stop using shocking policy shifts on Twitter to distract Americans from his failing health care plan."" Given that the issue of transgender troops may be unfamiliar to many readers, we thought we’d check Pocan’s claim that more than 15,000 are serving in the military. No official data The Pentagon has said it does not know how many transgender people serve in uniform because until 2016, they faced discharge if they revealed their identities. A Pentagon spokesman did not reply when we asked if the the Pentagon has any estimates. The U.S. Census Bureau also does not collect data on sexual orientation or gender identity. (In April 2016, more than 75 members of Congress wrote to the Census Bureau to request the addition of sexual orientation and gender identity as a subject for the bureau’s regular American Community Survey. The bureau concluded, according to a March 2017 memo, that ""there was no federal data need"" to include those.) So, there are no official statistics on the number of transgender people in the military. That leaves us with two prominently cited studies that produced estimates which vary. 2014 study To support Pocan’s statement, his office referred us to a 2014 report by UCLA Law School’s Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Law and Public Policy. (The Human Rights Campaign and the National Center for Transgender Equality pointed us to the same study.) That study estimated that 15,500 transgender individuals were serving on active duty or in the Guard or Reserve forces. The study said its primary source was a national survey done by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and the National Center for Transgender Equality, which the researchers said was the largest sample of transgender people in the United States available at the time. That survey was conducted over a six-month period starting in the fall of 2008. ""Data that allow for a direct tabulation of the number of transgender individuals who serve in the U.S. military simply do not exist,"" the researchers wrote. ""The estimates in this research brief rely on a variety of assumptions that could affect their accuracy."" They added, however, that ""the estimates certainly suggest that transgender individuals are part of the active duty U.S. armed forces, perhaps in portions that exceed that of the general population."" 2016 study A 2016 study by the RAND Corp., commissioned by the Pentagon, reported lower figures than the UCLA study. The RAND researchers estimated between 1,320 and 6,630 active duty and between 830 and 4,160 in the reserves. That would be a total of between 2,150 and 10,790 transgender service members, based on figures for people serving in the military in 2014. The study said the estimate was derived from data from multiple surveys. And the reseachers noted: ""It is important to note that there have been no rigorous epidemiological studies of the size"" of the U.S. transgender population, including those who serve in the military. Asked about the difference between the two studies, Pocan’s spokesman told us: ""Whenever we have multiple studies, we try to take the more inclusive one."" Our rating Pocan said: ""More than 15,000 transgender Americans"" are ""serving in the military today."" A UCLA study estimated the figure is 15,500, while a more recent study by the RAND Corp. estimated 2,150 to 10,790. There are no official counts, so Pocan goes too far in flatly stating his figure. But his figure matches one of two prominently cited estimates",Half True,"July 26, 2017"

Robertson never said those words, but if the goal is to drive traffic, passing them off as real seems to work. The 2015 version drew snarky comments from a website in the United Kingdom, and the latest verbatim copy pulled in angry responses from those who also took it as real. One commenter said, ""I think God will go after him and his fortune for being close-minded and prejudiced. The Bible teaches us to love each other no matter who they are.""

"Says North Carolina's replacement for HB2 ""orders NC cities to discriminate against LGBT people until at least 2020 and unfair ‘bathroom bans’ remain.""","Joining the national anger over North Carolina’s new law replacing the controversial House Bill 2 was Caitlyn Jenner. Jenner is perhaps the most famous transgender person in America. So when she began criticizing North Carolina’s new law to her 4 million Twitter followers, people took note. A bipartisan deal between legislators and Gov. Roy Cooper last week got rid of some of HB2’s controversial parts, but it retained two parts of HB2 that Democrats and advocates for LGBT rights have criticized for the past year. Jenner has been among those critics, even though she’s a Republican. And she was not pleased about the compromise. ""The new law orders NC cities to discriminate against LGBT people until at least 2020 and unfair ‘bathroom bans’ remain,"" she said. There have been exaggerations and falsehoods on both sides of the HB2 debate. We’ve fact-checked many of them. And this claim sounded like a stretch, so we took a look at it. We contacted Jenner’s publicist to help us understand what she meant, but have not heard back. Bathroom rules We’ll tackle Jenner’s claims in reverse order. She ended her post by saying that North Carolina’s ""‘bathroom bans’ remain."" That seems to be a reference to the provision of HB2 that had banned transgender people in government facilities from using the bathroom of the gender with which they identify – and which instead required everyone to use the bathroom of the gender on their birth certificates. But although Jenner said that ban remains on the books, the opposite is true. The most high-profile change this new law made was getting rid of that part of HB2. In fact, that’s precisely why so many conservative politicians and interest groups opposed the new law. Tami Fitzgerald, executive director of the NC Values Coalition, said it ""leaves the state without a statewide public policy on privacy and safety in bathrooms, locker rooms and showers."" (As an aside, we previously found there are virtually no instances of sexual predators using transgender-friendly bathroom laws as cover to commit crimes.) North Carolina has now rejoined 48 other states in having no law about who can use which bathroom. The only outlier now is Washington, which is on the other end of the spectrum and has a transgender-friendly bathroom law. It is possible that Jenner meant this part of her claim as a reference to the new law’s prohibition on state agencies, colleges and school districts regulating access to bathrooms and locker rooms -- which blocks them from creating transgender-friendly policies. But no matter how you interpret it, the fact remains that transgender people are no longer banned from using the bathroom of the gender with which they identify. There is now simply no law at all on bathroom access. Furthermore, any private business that wants to enact its own transgender-friendly bathroom policies has always been able to do so and still can. And that leads us to the other part of her claim. Mandatory discrimination? ""The new law orders NC cities to discriminate against LGBT people until at least 2020,"" Jenner said. What the law says is that through Dec. 1, 2020, cities and counties can’t pass local anti-discrimination ordinances related to employment or public accommodations. That means LGBT people won’t be protected from discrimination in North Carolina for at least the next three-plus years, unless the legislature makes another change. But that’s a far cry from ordering cities to discriminate, which this law does not do. No, the mayors of North Carolina are not required to engage in anti-gay behavior, nor must they require businesses in their communities to do the same. Similarly, there’s no federal law protecting LGBT people from workplace discrimination. That doesn’t mean Congress is ordering every company in America to discriminate against gay or transgender people. And most other states also lack these protections, as we found in a previous fact-check. Improvements for gay rights And despite widespread condemnation from LGBT activists, the new law did make some concessions to HB2 opponents. For instance, HB2’s bans on local ordinances were indefinite, but the new bans expire in 2020. It rolled back a provision of HB2 that – as we found in a previous fact-check – might have prohibited cities and counties from protecting even their own employees from anti-LGBT discrimination. There’s no more ambiguity now. Under the new law, if local elected officials want to protect their own local government employees from anti-LGBT discrimination, they can. HB2 had also banned local governments from having certain requirements for would-be contractors – including, for example, a mandate that the contractors have discrimination protections for LGBT people. Now, cities and counties are once more allowed to have those requirements for contractors, according to the UNC School of Government’s Norma Houston – who is an expert in public government contracting – as well as Carrboro Town Attorney Nick Herman, who said the town’s pro-LGBT contractor ordinance is now back in place. Our ruling After North Carolina replaced HB2, pro-LGBT activists said the compromise was not nearly enough. Caitlyn Jenner, one of the country’s most famous transgender celebrities, took that criticism a step further when she tweeted: ""The new law orders NC cities to discriminate against LGBT people until at least 2020 and unfair ‘bathroom bans’ remain."" Neither part of that is correct. The bathroom ban was repealed. And while the new law does continue banning cities and counties from giving LGBT people local discrimination protections, that’s not even close to the same as ordering discrimination. Her statement makes two claims",False,"April 4, 2017"
"Says HB2 has hurt North Carolina’s economy by ""one-tenth of 1 percent of our annual GDP.""","The boycotts of North Carolina by businesses, musicians, sports leagues and others have led to national headlines and outrage from opponents of the law that spurred the backlash. House Bill 2, or HB2 as it’s more commonly known, has been creating economic backlash against North Carolina for nearly a year now. The controversial law was the first (and so far, only) in the nation to say that transgender people can’t use the bathrooms or locker rooms of the gender with which they identify in government facilities like schools or parks. It also continued North Carolina’s policy of not giving people protection from anti-LGBT discrimination and banned any city or county from extending local nondiscrimination rules. It also banned local governments from enacting rules related to issues like the minimum wage or paid family leave. North Carolina Lt. Gov. Dan Forest spoke in Texas at a press conference Monday in support of a bill similar to HB2 that’s under consideration there. Forest said the backlash is worth it to protect people’s privacy and safety in bathrooms. And, he said, the backlash hasn’t even been that big in the grand scheme of things: That despite the steady stream of boycotts and cancellations, North Carolina’s economy has barely been harmed by HB2. ""If you look at the most extreme instances of economic impact, by the media and by the universities and the people who come out and say ‘This is the impact,’ that most extreme impact equates to one-tenth of 1 percent of our annual GDP,"" Forest said. We have seen instances of politicians trying to deflect or whitewash the effects of HB2 – we gave former Gov. Pat McCrory a Pants On Fire ruling for a ludicrous claim he made about a high-profile Bruce Springsteen concert cancellation – so we wanted to look into this most recent claim by Forest. NC by the numbers It could be that Forest has been reading some of our previous coverage of HB2. His claim is exactly what we reported in October, in a fact-check of McCrory’s top economic official. At that time, former Commerce Secretary John Skvarla had said that HB2 hadn’t had ""one iota"" of a negative effect on North Carolina’s economy. We ruled that claim Mostly False. Our research, plus interviews with economists and analysis of other studies, has shown HB2 probably cost the state between $450 million and $630 million. Others have cited a $500 million loss. The law has also cost North Carolina a minimum of 1,400 jobs. ""North Carolina’s GDP is around $510 billion,"" we wrote at the time. ""So even a $500 million loss would only represent 0.1 percent of that."" That’s exactly what Forest said Monday. (For the mathematically-challenged out there, 0.1 percent is the same thing as one-tenth of 1 percent.) GDP means gross domestic product. When states are concerned it’s sometimes called GSP for gross state product. It counts a combination of consumer spending, government spending and other measures of economic output. In recent months, there haven’t been many major new boycotts or cancellations – or at least, none that have been publicly verified. The NCAA could soon pull years’ worth of championship events out of North Carolina, costing the state millions more, but that hasn’t happened yet. And even if there have been hundreds of millions more in losses that we don’t know about yet, that still wouldn’t change the truth of Forest’s claim. Whether North Carolina has lost $500 million, $600 million or even $1 billion, that’s still just a small fraction of the state’s overall economy. For that same reason that Skvarla’s argument didn’t really hold up, Forest’s is accurate: North Carolina’s economy has indeed been harmed by HB2. But the economy as a whole is large enough that it would take some serious losses to add up to even a 1 percent loss. North Carolina has the country’s ninth-largest population and 10th-largest economy. The state’s GDP was the nation’s fastest-growing several years ago, we found in a fact-check of a True claim McCrory made last year. But it was slowing down by the end of McCrory’s time in office, and in 2015 North Carolina’s GDP growth was below the national average, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Other economic factors at play Forest made a number of other economic claims about North Carolina’s job growth, unemployment rate and budget surpluses. Some were more accurate than others. For a more detailed explanation, see this roundup of other claims Forest made Monday. Forest also cited several magazines or other groups that have rated North Carolina a good place to do business, even despite the headlines and headaches HB2 has created. He’s right about that, too. As we noted last year: ""And even after HB2 passed and the backlash became apparent, CNBC rated North Carolina the fifth-best state for business. And the trade publication Site Selection Magazine ranked North Carolina and Texas as tied for the title of ""most competitive state."" Our ruling Forest said HB2’s economic harm to North Carolina has amounted to only ""one-tenth of 1 percent of our annual GDP."" He’s right. While $500 million in economic losses (not to mention at least 1,400 jobs lost) is not insignificant, the state’s overall economy is large enough that the losses are only about 0.1 percent of the total GDP",True,"March 7, 2017"
"Says Tammy Baldwin ""wants to require children starting at age 5 to learn about gay sex!""","The sexuality of Tammy Baldwin, the nation’s first openly gay U.S. senator, is under attack by a group that says it wants to unseat her in an election that is 21 months away. Restore American Freedom and Liberty goes personal on the Wisconsin Democrat as part of what it says is an effort to draft conservative Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. to run against her in 2018. In a fundraising email revealed by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Feb. 16, 2017, the group calls Baldwin a ""pervert"" and ""disgusting."" It also uses extreme language in claiming Baldwin ""wants to require children starting at age 5 to learn about gay sex!"" That claim caught our attention. The group The Denver-based Restore American Freedom and Liberty, according to the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics, is a so-called Carey committee -- a ""hybrid"" political action committee that is not affiliated with a candidate and can operate as a traditional PAC, contributing funds to a candidate's committee, and as a super PAC, which makes independent expenditures. The Journal Sentinel reported that Restore American Freedom and Liberty is one of four pro-Clarke groups that drop the names of popular politicians in fundraising appeals but then use the cash primarily on consultants, not candidates. Denver attorney Alexander Hornaday, the treasurer for the group, did not reply to our email and phone requests for information to back up the group’s attack on Baldwin. According to the Denver Post, Hornaday is a gay Republican who was a leader of the Colorado chapter of the Log Cabin Republicans, which represents gay conservatives. The attack Since Restore American Freedom and Liberty didn’t respond to us, we’re left to search for what its claim might be alluding to. We found three pieces of legislation backed by Baldwin, none of which became law, that are possibilities in that they all pertained to gay students. Orientation surveys: In 2010, as a member of the U.S. House, Baldwin introduced a bill that would have required a federal agency to request sexual orientation data in health-related national surveys it does. But the bill did not have any requirement to teach children about gay sex. Bullying in schools: In 2015, Baldwin co-sponsored a bill to require states to direct their local educational agencies to establish policies that prevent and prohibit bullying. The bill states that students have been singled out for bullying based on various factors, including sexual orientation and gender identity. Again, no requirement to teach about sex. Sex education: In 2016, Baldwin co-sponsored a bill that would, among other things, require the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to award grants for training teachers and staff to teach age-appropriate comprehensive sex education to elementary and secondary school students. For the elementary students, the teaching would be aimed at ""broadening student knowledge about issues related to human development, relationships, personal skills and sexual behavior, including abstinence."" None of the grants could be given to programs that ""are insensitive and unresponsive to the needs of sexually active youth or lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth."" So, that legislation provides financial incentives to teach sex education in a manner that is inclusive of gay students. But it’s not a requirement. It’s a grant program that school districts can choose to apply for. What’s more, it is for elementary and high school students, not targeted at kindergarteners. Indeed, the bill dictates the education be age appropriate, making it highly unlikely that 5-year-olds would be taught about sex acts. Our rating Restore American Freedom and Liberty says Baldwin ""wants to require children starting at age 5 to learn about gay sex!"" The group did not reply to our requests for information that would back the statement. And we could not find any evidence that Baldwin supports such a requirement. If information surfaces that was available when the group made its claim and it is relevant, we could reconsider this fact check",False,"February 27, 2017"
"Says Betsy DeVos and her family ""have donated extensively to groups which promote the idea that students who identify as LGBT must undergo 'conversion' therapy.""","An openly gay congressman has injected conversion therapy -- which aims to use counseling and often religious teaching to convert someone who is homosexual -- into the debate over President Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of education. U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, a Madison-area Democrat who has called for prohibiting the use of such therapy on minors, attacked Betsy DeVos in a letter on Jan. 11, 2017, six days before her Senate confirmation hearing. The letter, signed by Pocan and the other four co-chairs of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, was sent to the leaders of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which is scheduled to vote on DeVos’ nomination on Jan. 31, 2017. The letter said DeVos, an education activist and a major Republican donor from Michigan, has tried to undermine the rights of people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. And it included a claim about conversion therapy and students, saying of DeVos:

She and her family have donated extensively to groups which promote the idea that students who identify as LGBT must undergo ""conversion"" therapy and have also affiliated with groups that oppose anti-bullying legislation. The next secretary of education must represent all students in our country. Anyone who promotes such fervently anti-LGBT viewpoints is wholly unqualified to serve as the secretary of education. So, Pocan is charging that DeVos and her family ""have donated extensively to groups which promote the idea that students who identify as LGBT must undergo 'conversion' therapy."" More on DeVos, conversion therapy DeVos, whose wealth is estimated by Bloomberg at $130 million, is the daughter-in-law of billionaire Richard DeVos, the co-founder of Amway. She was part of a previous Pocan claim, that Trump's Cabinet appointments have a net worth of ""more than a third of America."" Our rating was Mostly True. One-third of American households have a combined net worth of roughly zero. So, the combined net worth of Trump Cabinet members is greater, though so is that of any American who has a net worth of more than zero. At DeVos’ confirmation hearing, U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Penn., accused DeVos of giving $25,000 to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, which has lobbied for more rights for college students accused of sexual assault. PolitiFact Pennsylvania rated the claim Mostly True. DeVos was also asked about her family donating to groups that push conversion therapy. She disputed the characterization of her family’s donations and, though Pocan’s claim doesn’t refer to her personal position on conversion therapy, DeVos said she has ""never believed in that."" Conversion therapy -- also known as reparative therapy and sexual orientation change effort -- is supported by some Christian groups, such as Focus on the Family, which says it should be available for people who have ""unwanted homosexual attractions."" A number of medical groups warn of its dangers and at least two of them -- the American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Family Physicians -- outright oppose it. The association says the risks include depression, anxiety and self-destructive behavior. (U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., announced Jan. 23, 2017 that she will oppose DeVos’ nomination. Baldwin, who is also openly gay, did not mention gay rights in her announcement.) Money part of Pocan’s claim To back Pocan’s claim, his office cited two groups: Focus on the Family and the Traditional Values Coalition. Let’s start with the ""donated extensively"" part of the claim. The office cited reports from two interest groups on Colorado-based Focus on the Family, which was founded by James Dobson, an evangelical Christian. One says says the DeVos family has given more than $6.7 million to Focus on the Family and the other says DeVos and her husband, Dick, have given $275,000 to the group. We found a comparable figure by checking federal tax records. They show that from 2003 to 2015, the Edgar and Elsa Prince Foundation of Holland, Mich., gave $5.7 million to Focus on the Family. DeVos was listed as the foundation’s vice president, though at her Senate confirmation hearing, she said that was a ""clerical error."" In contrast, Pocan’s office did not cite any reports on DeVos giving to the Traditional Values Coalition, a California-based conservative religious activist group. And we found nothing in tax records to indicate DeVos contributions to the coalition. (Two web articles say the Dick and Betsy DeVos Family Foundation has given money to the Traditional Values Coalition. But the article appears to mix up the coalition with the Michigan-based Foundation for Traditional Values, which the DeVos foundation has supported.) Conversion therapy part of the claim As for the second part of Pocan’s claim, we found indications that both groups cited by the congressman support conversion therapy. But no evidence that they believe that students who identify as LGBT must undergo it. And a spokeswoman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks such groups, said the center is not aware of either group making such a statement. Focus on the Family has issued statements in support of people changing their orientation, including this one from June 2013: God’s help usually doesn’t come as a fast fix. It’s often a long process. Many times it takes counseling, Bible study, prayer and community support  —  but it can be done. Here at Focus we’ve seen marriages reconciled. We’ve seen people who struggle with unwanted same-sex attraction change. We’ve seen people experience real transformation in their thoughts, behaviors, attractions and identity. The group also maintains a web page entitled ""Leaving Homosexuality."" One section notes there is opposition to conversion therapy, but states ""there is a great deal of evidence that also shows that people have been helped"" by such therapy. It says ""individuals should have the availability of professional therapy options for unwanted homosexual attractions and behavior."" A Focus on the Family spokesman told us that ""many individuals -- including students -- with same sex-attractions find those feelings to be in conflict with their faith and Focus on the Family strongly supports their right to seek help from licensed mental health professionals as they work to resolve this conflict and steward their sexuality according to their religious beliefs."" The evidence is less clear for the Traditional Values Coalition, which hosted a ""Christian Inaugural Gala"" as part of Trump’s inauguration. The Los Angeles Times reported on a conversion therapy conference that was led by evangelist Louis P. Sheldon, the coalition’s founder. But the conference was in 1990, the article didn’t mention students and we didn’t find any more recent statements from the coalition about conversion therapy. To be sure, the coalition is not viewed as friendly to gay people. Its website says military chaplains are being prevented ""from speaking out in any way against homosexuality."" And in 2015, the coalition filed a lawsuit, which was dismissed, seeking to block the Fairfax County School Board in Virginia from implementing protections the board put in place for gay and transgender students. Our rating Pocan says DeVos and her family ""have donated extensively to groups which promote the idea that students who identify as LGBT must undergo 'conversion' therapy."" A family foundation that listed DeVos as the vice president has given millions of dollars over more than a decade to one of two groups cited by Pocan, Focus on the Family. But we couldn’t find evidence of donations to the Traditional Values Coalition. And although there are indications that both groups support conversion therapy, we didn’t find evidence that they promote the idea that students who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender must undergo it",Mostly False,"January 25, 2017"
"""The White House removed its climate change web page. And the healthcare, civil rights and LGBT sections.""","Barack Obama was the first president to have a robust digital strategy. His team was active on social media, and they constantly uploaded new content and tools to the White House website. But after President Donald Trump was sworn in on Jan. 20, 2017, some critics of the new administration noticed that pages about issues of importance to Obama are no longer accessible on whitehouse.gov. ""The White House removed its climate change web page. And the health care, civil rights and LGBT sections,"" tweeted George Takei, the former Star Trek actor who now has a large online fanbase. Takei is correct that as of Jan. 23, whitehouse.gov doesn’t have any specific information about climate change, health care, civil rights or LGBT issues. But these changes are routine and reflect the differences between Obama’s and Trump’s priorities. Back in October, the Obama administration laid out how it would manage the digital transition. The National Archives and Records Administration would preserve every piece of content the Obama administration published online — everything from blog posts and Tweets to transcripts and Snapchat stories. The National Archives would also freeze and archive any content posted to whitehouse.gov, then the Obama administration would hand over the domain to the Trump administration. The archived content is now accessible at ObamaWhiteHouse.archives.gov, including pages about climate change, health care, civil rights and LGBT issues.    So if we’re going to be nit-picky, it was the Obama administration that removed whitehouse.gov’s pages about these issues, along with every other piece of content their team ever published. The Trump administration started off with a blank slate. When populating the website with their own content, they did not create pages about the four issues Takei mentioned. They did, however, create six pages about issues that defined the Trump campaign: energy, foreign policy, jobs and economic growth, military, law enforcement, and trade. The Obama team handled the whitehouse.gov transition in the same manner as the George W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations. (Their websites are archived at georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov and clinton4.nara.gov, respectively.) The National Archives treats whitehouse.gov as a presidential record and follows the relevant regulations to preserve the content for posterity, while ""the new administration is free to shape a ‘new’ White House website going forward,"" said Douglas Cox, a law professor and expert in information policy at the City University of New York. Cox added as an aside that while whitehouse.gov is well-preserved from administration to administration, the websites for federal agencies may not be. So there is a bigger concern that federal records produced by the agencies in prior administrations may get lost. When the Obama team took over whitehouse.gov, they completely replaced all of Bush’s policy pages with 24 of their own, reflecting the new administration’s agenda, said Macon Phillips, who oversaw the website changes as Obama’s director of new media during the 2008 transition. The change from Bush’s version of whitehouse.gov to Obama’s was dramatic in its own way. While Trump kept the same digital platform the Obama team used, Obama’s transition team was working with a brand new one. Here’s a screenshot of whitehouse.gov on the morning of Jan. 20, 2009, the day of Obama’s inauguration, next to a screenshot from that same evening (found using the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine):  Phillips said the fact that the Trump website doesn’t have pages about things like LGBT issues and climate change isn’t really about the new administration removing pages — it’s more that his team just hasn’t made those issues a priority. ""Whitehouse.gov should reflect the priorities and point of view of the president. It’s a tool of that office,"" said Phillips, who just ended three years as coordinator of the State Department’s International Information Programs Bureau. The Trump administration did keep one notable page from the Obama administration’s whitehouse.gov: the We the People page, where the public can sign electronic petitions. Under the Obama administration, any petition to garner 100,000 signatures in under 30 days would receive a response from the White House. A petition for Trump to release his tax returns got more than 271,000 signatures in four days. It’s unclear if the new administration will officially respond to the petition. Our ruling Takei said, ""The White House removed its climate change web page. And the healthcare, civil rights and LGBT sections."" It is literally accurate that since Trump became president, whitehouse.gov no longer has specific issue pages about health care, civil rights, LGBT issues or climate change. This reflects a difference in priorities between the Obama and Trump administrations. But it’s important to keep in mind that when the Obama administration handed the whitehouse.gov domain to Trump’s team, it was a blank slate. All of the online content published during Obama’s term was purged and archived. They’re now available on a website set up by the National Archives, as was done at the end of the Clinton and Bush administrations",Mostly True,"January 23, 2017"
"""We would be just like North Carolina with HB2-like (transgender bathroom) legislation. It actually passed our chamber and I vetoed it.""","Gov. Terry McAuliffe recently took credit for saving Virginia from passing a law similar to North Carolina’s HB2 act that dictates which public restrooms transgender people can use. ""I’ve had to veto some very bad bills,"" McAuliffe said Nov. 30 during his monthly radio show on WTOP in Washington. ""We would be just like North Carolina with HB2-like legislation. It actually passed our chamber and I vetoed it."" Republicans, who control both houses of Virginia’s General Assembly, quickly mocked the Democratic governor’s claim. ""Uh, no."" the Republican Party of Virginia tweeted. ""Why can't @GovernorVA simply tell the truth about this? Does he not even know what he vetoed?"" So we checked whether McAuliffe’s statement is correct.  It came at the end of a segment is which the governor said he thinks President-elect Donald Trump, a Republican, is not an ""ideologue"" on social issues and wants to focus on boosting the economy. North Carolina HR2, also called the ""bathroom bill,"" was passed by North Carolina’s General Assembly on March 23, 2016, and signed by Republican Gov. Pat McCrory that night. The state law has two main provisions: *It requires transgender people to use the restrooms in many public facilities that correspond to the sex listed on their birth certificate instead of the sex with which they identify. The law applies to school bathrooms, locker rooms and showers as well as the facilities in state and local government buildings. *It set a state definition of classes of people who are protected from discrimination based on their race, religion, color, national origin, age, handicap or ""biological sex."" Omitted from protection are transgender and gay people. The law has triggered a fierce backlash. The NBA, in protest, yanked its 2017 all-star game from Charlotte. The Atlantic Coast Conference and the NCAA pulled collegiate championship games that were scheduled to played in North Carolina this year and next. Financial service giants PayPal and Deutsche Bank froze expansion plans in North Carolina. Rock icons Bruce Springsteen, Pearl Jam and Ringo Starr canceled concerts in the state. All told, Forbes magazine estimated on Nov. 3 that the law had cost North Carolina $630 million in lost business. Now, let’s move north. Virginia Brian Coy, communications chief for McAuliffe, told us that the governor’s radio comment referred to his veto of a so-called ""religious freedom"" bill on March 30, 2016 - exactly one week after HB2 was signed in North Carolina. The Virginia bill would have protected ministers and religious entities from facing government-imposed penalties or civil liability for refusing to perform or host gay marriages. The sponsor - Sen. Bill Carrico Sr., R-Grayson - said it would shield many religious people from being forced to act against their beliefs. Opponents said the legislation promoted bigotry against the LGBT community. The bill passed both chambers of the Virginia General Assembly on party-line votes with Republicans supporting it and Democrats opposed. McAuliffe vetoed the measure on March 30, writing that the legislation, if signed, would send a message that Virginia is ""more concerned with demonizing people than with creating a strong business climate."" You may have noticed that the Virginia bill, unlike the North Carolina legislation McAuliffe compared it to, didn’t mention restrooms. In fact, it had nothing to do with them. It didn’t restrict anyone’s use of bathrooms in state, local government or school buildings - let alone their use by transgender people. In substance, the bill was quite different from HB2. Coy acknowledged those distinctions to us but stressed that the two bills have broad similarities: both are discriminatory and are bad for business growth. McAuliffe ""fully understands that the (Virginia) bill had different language than HB2 in North Carolina did,"" Coy wrote in an email. ""His point is that it would have had very similar consequences in sending a message to businesses and individuals around the world that Virginia is a place where we sanction against LGBT people simply because of whom they love."" The governor, we should point out, offered no such elaboration during the radio broadcast. A final note: There was a bathroom bill introduced in Virginia’s General Assembly that came pretty close to mirroring HR2. The legislation - introduced by Del. Mark Cole, R-Spotsylvania - would have required people to use the restrooms in schools and state-owned buildings that correspond to their ""biological sex."" The measure was killed by a House committee. Our ruling McAuliffe said, ""We would be just like North Carolina with HB2-like (transgender bathroom) legislation. It actually passed our chamber and I vetoed it."" The governor vetoed a bill that would have protected ministers and religious entities from facing government-imposed penalties or civil liability for refusing to perform or host gay marriages. HB2 says transgender people in North Carolina must use restrooms in schools and other government facilities that match with the sex listed on their birth certificates instead of the sex with which they identify. It raises the spectacle of government enforcing a law aimed against a tiny minority. It has provoked protests and boycotts from businesses, sports organizations and entertainers that have cost the state dearly. The two bills are comparable in that they allow discrimination against members of the LGBT community. But they are very different in substance and it’s misleading for McAuliffe to say that his veto saved Virginia from being ‘just like North Carolina with HB2-like legislation",Mostly False,"December 5, 2016"

Readers pointed out that Pence never explicitly advocated for conversion therapy in his statement and that he may have been pushing for safer sex practices. Pence’s words are open to other interpretations: Gay and lesbian leaders, for example, say his statement continues to give the impression that he supported the controversial practice of conversion therapy when his words are viewed in context with his long opposition to LGBT rights. Taking all of this into account, we are changing our rating to Half True and providing this new analysis. PolitiFact California’s practice is to consider new evidence and perspectives related to our fact checks, and to revise our ratings when warranted. California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom joined in the chorus of attacks on Donald Trump’s choice for running mate during a speech at the Democratic National Convention in late July. Newsom, a prominent LGBT rights supporter, said Republican Indiana Gov. and now Vice-President Elect Mike Pence ""advocated for diverting taxpayer dollars to so-called conversion therapy."" Conversion therapy is a controversial practice that seeks to change a person’s sexual orientation from gay to straight. It’s banned in five states including California, Oregon, Illinois, Vermont and New Jersey. Our research When asked about the claim in late July, Newsom’s campaign spokesman pointed to Pence’s own words. During his first successful run for Congress in 2000, Pence wrote on his campaign website, under a section called Strengthening the American Family: ""Congress should support the reauthorization of the Ryan White Care Act only after completion of an audit to ensure that federal dollars were no longer being given to organizations that celebrate and encourage the types of behaviors that facilitate the spreading of the HIV virus. Resources should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior."" Many, including Newsom and other LGBT advocates, have interpreted the last portion of Pence’s statement, about ""assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior,"" as evidence he supported conversion therapy. The statement, however, does not explicitly mention conversion therapy. And Pence has said little, if anything, specific on the topic. We heard from a number of readers who said Pence’s words could be interpreted as supporting groups that aim to not necessarily change one’s sexual orientation, but instead as supporting groups that advocate for curbing sexual behaviors that lead to the spread of HIV/AIDS. Pence has, for example, advocated for abstinence as a way to prevent sexual diseases. ""Indeed, promoting safer sexual behaviour is a common intervention strategy in the fight against HIV/AIDS,"" reader Justin Goddard of Ontario, Canada, said in an email. Other fact-checking websites, such as Snopes.com, have examined the claim Pence supported conversion therapy and concluded it’s not a settled case. LGBT rights advocates say given Pence’s extensive record of opposing gays and lesbians, his words are indeed confirmation that he supported conversion therapy. ""That is very specific language — some might call it a dog whistle — that has been used for decades to very thinly cloak deeply homophobic beliefs,"" Rea Carey, executive director of the National L.G.B.T.Q. Task Force told the New York Times in late November. ""Particularly the phrase ‘seeking to change their sexual behavior,’ to me, is code for conversion therapy."" ""It’s the most likely reading"" of Pence’s words, Rick Zbur, executive director of Equality California, an LGBT civil rights group, told PolitiFact California. ""We view this in the context of the whole record. … You can’t think of someone who is more hostile to LGBT people and people with AIDS than Mike Pence."" Also on the 2000 website, Pence wrote: ""Congress should oppose any effort to put gay and lesbian relationships on an equal legal status with heterosexual marriage."" And ""Congress should oppose any effort to recognize homosexual’s [sic] as a 'discreet [sic] and insular minority' entitled to the protection of anti-discrimination laws similar to those extended to women and ethnic minorities."" Statement mischaracterized? In an email exchange with PolitiFact California in late July, Pence’s spokesman Marc Lotter did not directly answer whether Pence supported conversion therapy. Four months later, Lotter told the New York Times, however, that it was ""patently false"" that Mr. Pence ""supported or advocated"" the practice of conversion therapy. Lotter added that Pence had been calling for federal funds to ""be directed to groups that promoted safe sexual practices"" during his 2000 congressional campaign, and he said it was a ""mischaracterization"" to interpret the statement as a reference to conversion therapy. Newsom’s campaign spokesman said in November he did not have any additional information pointing to Pence’s stance on conversion therapy. As reported by McClatchy DC in July, Pence continues to be at the center of gay rights controversy: ""Pence angered gay rights groups (in 2015) when he signed a religious freedom bill that opponents said would allow businesses to discriminate against customers based on their sexual orientation. Pence later backtracked, when state lawmakers changed the law to say that no discrimination would be allowed."" At the Republican National Convention this summer, the McClatchy news service noted: ""Delegates voted to approve a platform that backs the right of parents to determine the proper medical treatment and therapy for their minor children. The platform makes no specific mention of gay conversion therapy, but critics say that passage is aimed at accepting the notion that one’s sexual orientation can be changed."" GOP Party Chairman Reince Priebus, who President-Elect Donald Trump has selected as chief of staff for the incoming administration, has denied that passage encourages conversion therapy. Our ruling California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom said Indiana Governor and now Vice President-Elect Mike Pence ""advocated for diverting taxpayer dollars to so-called conversion therapy."" Pence’s own words on his campaign website from 2000, specifically a passage that calls for funding groups that give ""assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior,"" have been interpreted by LGBT advocates as supporting the controversial practice. Pence’s statement, however, does not explicitly mention conversion therapy. Readers and other fact-checking outlets have said Pence may have been calling for safer sexual sexual practices rather than pushing for efforts to change one’s sexual orientation. When asked about the statement in July, Pence’s spokesman Marc Lotter did not directly answer whether the Indiana governor supports the practice. Months later, Lotter strongly denied that Pence supports conversion therapy and said Pence was calling for funds to ""be directed to groups that promoted safe sexual practices"" Given Pence’s strong and extensive opposition to LGBT rights, his words in 2000 have been widely interpreted as supporting the controversial practice. Rea Carey, executive director of the National L.G.B.T.Q. Task Force, has called them ""a dog whistle"" for like-minded supporters of conversion therapy. Newsom’s definitive claim, however, that Pence advocated for conversion therapy is not fully supported",Half True,"December 2, 2016"
"Says Donald Trump ""wants to undo marriage equality.""","Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump in a campaign speech of wanting to reverse the landmark 2015 Supreme Court decision allowing same-sex marriage. During a Nov. 2, 2016, rally in Las Vegas, Clinton gave a laundry list of ideals she said Donald Trump opposed, including equal rights for LGBTQ members. ""If you care about LGBT rights, he wants to undo marriage equality,"" she said of the Republican presidential candidate. She repeated the claim hours later at a rally in Tempe, Ariz. Trump has spoken out against marriage equality before, but we wondered if he still held that view. While he’s said gays and lesbians deserve protection under the law, he has also said he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would want to overturn the law. ‘I am for traditional marriage’ The first indication of Trump’s feelings on same-sex marriage go back to an interview in The Advocate in 2000, when Trump was allegedly considering running for president. ""I think the institution of marriage should be between a man and a woman,"" Trump said. He added that he favored a domestic partnership law that would give same-sex couples the same legal benefits as married couples. (He voiced support for Elton John’s 2005 civil union with David Furnish in a post on his now-defunct Trump University blog, however.) More than a decade later, in a March 2011 interview as he mulled a presidential run, Trump told Fox News host Bill O’Reilly that he was against marriage equality. ""I just don't feel good about it,"" Trump said. ""I don't feel right about it. I'm against it, and I take a lot of heat because I come from New York. You know, for New York it's like, how can you be against gay marriage? But I'm opposed to gay marriage."" Two years later, Trump hedged a bit: ""I think I’m evolving, and I think I’m a very fair person, but I have been for traditional marriage. I am for traditional marriage, I am for a marriage between a man and a woman,"" he told MSNBC in 2013. Then Trump announced he really was running for president on June 16, 2015, and he quickly reiterated he didn’t support marriage equality. After the U.S. Supreme Court ruling came out on June 26, Trump tweeted, ""Once again the Bush appointed Supreme Court Justice John Roberts has let us down. Jeb pushed him hard! Remember!"" Two days later, Trump told CNN’s Jake Tapper on CNN that he was ""just for traditional marriage."" Trump said the next month that he thought pushing a constitutional amendment that banned same-sex marriage would not be a realistic approach. But by October 2015, he began to indicate that he would seek to overturn the Obergefell vs. Hodges ruling that legalized same-sex marriage. ""We have some very terrible Supreme Court justices, and frankly, they should have at least had that as a state's right issue,"" he told CBN News. He also said he considered the ruling the law now. He told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace on Jan. 31, 2016, that he disagreed with the court’s 5-4 decision. ""If I'm elected, I would be very strong on putting certain judges on the bench that I think maybe could change things,"" Trump said. ""They have ruled on it. I wish that it was done by the state. I don't like the way they ruled. I disagree with the Supreme Court from the standpoint they should have given the state — it should be a states' rights issue. And that's the way it should have been ruled on, Chris, not the way they did it."" Looking for a concise answer, Wallace asked Trump if he would ""try to appoint justices to overrule the decision on same-sex marriage."" ""I could strongly consider that, yes,"" Trump said. His position didn’t change during the litany of GOP primary debates, although he hasn’t strongly reiterated how he wanted to appoint judges who would reverse the decision. In March 2016, he said at a Detroit debate that he agreed with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s opposition to the ruling. ""I would certainly have rather left it to the states,"" Trump said. ""I was very surprised when they came up with that decision. I would preferred it had been left to the states, and I think most people would have preferred that."" Since then, Trump has said little about same-sex marriage. Trump's campaign didn't respond to our request for comment, and Clinton's spokesman didn't add any further comment. His stump speeches tend to avoid same-sex marriage, and we couldn’t find any instance of a traditional media outlet directly asking him about it since the debates. When the GOP unveiled its party platform during this summer’s Republican National Convention, which urged the reversal of ""the Supreme Court’s redefinition of marriage,"" Trump’s influence was downplayed. Trump ""has not really tried to weigh in on the platform,"" Wyoming Sen. John Barasso, the platform committee chairman, told NPR in July. Our ruling Clinton said Trump ""wants to undo marriage equality."" While he’s waffled slightly at times, Trump has said repeatedly that he supported ""traditional marriage."" He also has said he would consider appointing Supreme Court justices that would reverse the 2015 ruling allowing same-sex marriage. He has not said much on the subject in recent months, other than to reiterate he felt it should have been a state-level decision. But he has not recanted his earlier views, either",True,"November 3, 2016"
"Says HB2 ""hasn’t moved the needle one iota"" on North Carolina’s economy.","The top economic official in Gov. Pat McCrory’s administration said North Carolina’s controversial ""bathroom bill"" has done nothing to the state economy. Commerce Secretary John Skvarla said in a speech Monday that as far as North Carolina’s economic health is concerned, House Bill 2 ""hasn’t moved the needle one iota."" He went on to say that publicity over the law does not match its actual impact. The word ""iota"" that Skvarla used is defined as ""a very small amount"" or ""an infinitesimal amount."" So clearly Skvarla is confident the law has had basically zero effect on the state economy. We previously rated a claim that HB2 had cost North Carolina $500 million as False. The downfall of that claim was it cited a study that said North Carolina might lose more than $500 million, not that it already had. At the time we found a more accurate estimate of losses was between $77 million and $201 million. Since then hits have continued to come, including more job losses and the NBA, NCAA and ACC pulling postseason games out of North Carolina. Yet at the same time, North Carolina has a large population and economy. Could it be true that the losses haven’t really left a mark? Arguments on his side North Carolina’s GDP is around $510 billion. So even a $500 million loss would only represent 0.1 percent of that. And even after HB2 passed and the backlash became apparent, CNBC rated North Carolina the fifth-best state for business. And the trade publication Site Selection Magazine ranked North Carolina and Texas as tied for the title of ""most competitive state."" The magazine interviewed Skvarla, including a question about HB2. Skvarla responded he believes concerned business leaders are simply misinformed (if so, they can read our fact-checks on HB2 here), and that his office tries to remind them of the many successful companies in North Carolina. He also mentions the state’s educated populace. ""The key factor often comes down to North Carolina’s talented and skilled workers,"" Skvarla said. But is that the whole story? HB2 and jobs No major companies have said they came to North Carolina because of HB2, so it certainly hasn’t helped on that front. And several have announced they stopped planned growth out of protest. The two most prominent were PayPal and Deutsche Bank, which canceled 400 new jobs in Charlotte and 250 new jobs in Cary, respectively. Given the average salaries they had promised, those jobs would’ve paid workers in those two cities nearly $42 million every year. That’s nothing to scoff at, even if the jobs themselves would not have had much of an impact on the two cities’ unemployment rates. Kim Genardo, a spokeswoman for Skvarla, said the losses have been more than offset by other companies announcing jobs since then. ""In one fell swoop the CSX announcement this summer in Edgecombe County is more than triple that (PayPal) jobs number,"" she said. That’s a possibility. The train company itself will only employ 150 people when it opens a new shipping hub in 2020, but the company said it thinks it will lead to the creation of about 1,500 jobs elsewhere in the state. The state plans to pay CSX $122.1 million in incentives. Yet on the same day Skvarla made his claim about HB2, real estate analytics firm CoStar Group announced it would bring 730 jobs to Richmond, Virginia – with an estimated economic impact of $250 million. David Dorsch, a Charlotte real estate broker who had worked with the company, told the Charlotte Business Journal that CoStar had been leaning toward Charlotte. ""The primary reason they chose Richmond over Charlotte was HB2,"" he was quoted as saying. The PayPal, Deutsche Bank and CoStar losses add up to nearly 1,400 jobs. And the chambers of commerce in Raleigh and Asheville blame HB2 for losing an additional 1,500 jobs from unnamed companies. Losses below the radar Other companies skip North Carolina without an announcement, said consultant Dennis Donovan. He’s a partner with Wadley Donovan Gutshaw Consulting in New Jersey, which helps businesses pick new locations. Donovan called Skvarla’s claim ""patently false."" A finance company and a manufacturing company he works with have decided not to consider North Carolina because of HB2, Donovan said – ""and we're a small sample size, so you’ve got to imagine there are many companies out there feeling the same."" Donovan said personal beliefs don’t matter: If a company thinks being in North Carolina will hurt its brand, or its ability to hire and keep the best employees, it’s an easy business decision to go elsewhere. Sports losses Beyond the job losses are the state’s lost tourism dollars. We can’t account for individuals moving their vacations due to HB2, but we do know about major events that were cancelled. Four of the state’s seven largest cities’ chambers of commerce – Charlotte, Raleigh, Durham and Cary – have come out against the the law. Lost conferences and concerts harmed all of them, as did sporting events. Charlotte estimates it lost $100 million when the NBA moved its All Star Game, and $30 million from the loss of the ACC football championship. Greensboro estimated it lost $15 million from various NCAA games, and Cary has said it already lost $2 million and will likely lose millions more since the NCAA is currently deciding where to put games through the 2021-22 season. Our ruling North Carolina has undeniably lost money and jobs due to HB2, so Skvarla’s claim that the law ""hasn’t moved the needle one iota"" on the economy seems incorrect at first glance. On a macro scale, however, Skvarla has a point. Even hundreds of millions of dollars in losses won’t dent the state’s GDP very much. And the now-canceled jobs would not have had much of an impact on the overall unemployment rate. Yet many local economies – particularly in Wake and Mecklenburg counties, the state’s two largest – have felt the sting of hundreds of jobs lost, that would have provided tens of millions of dollars in annual wages. That would have helped the economy. So would the tens of thousands of sports fans who will now spend their money in other states",Mostly False,"October 28, 2016"
"""Gov. (Pat) McCrory took $500,000 directly out of the disaster relief fund. And you know what it’s for? House Bill 2.""","As flooding from Hurricane Matthew continues to ravage much of eastern North Carolina, even days after the storm subsided, the state’s preparedness has become a political fight. Roy Cooper, the Democratic challenger for governor who is also the state’s attorney general, accused Republican Gov. Pat McCrory of a short-sighted move to divert emergency funds into defending a partisan controversy. ""Gov. McCrory took $500,000 directly out of the disaster relief fund,"" Cooper said during their Oct. 11 debate. ""And you know what it’s for? House Bill 2."" HB2, or the ""bathroom bill"" as it’s commonly known, has become one of the defining issues of this election. There are several parts to it, including restricting bathroom access for transgender people in public buildings and excluding LGBT people from discrimination protections. We’ve written many fact-checks on HB2, including whether it took away any existing rights, how unique North Carolina’s LGBT protections (or lack thereof) are now, and the risk of sexual predators due to transgender-friendly bathroom rules. For all our fact checks on the law, see here. McCrory signed HB2 in March. Since then private citizens have sued, and so has the U.S. Department of Justice, which argues it violates civil rights laws. Cooper, as attorney general, has refused to defend HB2 in court. He says he believes it’s unconstitutional. We fact-checked whether he’s allowed to do that here. With Cooper out, the state will have to hire other lawyers – unless the legislature repeals HB2, which Cooper has urged but which legislative leaders have so far refused to do. And that’s what brings us to this claim. Cooper said McCrory pulled $500,000 from disaster funds to use for those lawyers, but McCrory retorted it wasn’t true. ""We haven’t spent one dollar of the disaster relief money. We were approved to by the legislature, and I made a statement: We will not spend any of that money. (Cooper) knows that. He’s being deceptive to the public of North Carolina."" McCrory’s campaign later called Cooper’s claim ""the lie of the night."" Starting with the basics Cooper is right about the amount of money. A new law ordered the transfer of $500,000 of disaster relief money to McCrory’s office for ""costs incurred from litigation related to"" HB2. Cooper said McCrory ""took"" that money, but ""took"" has multiple meanings. One is more active, like ""grabbed. "" The other is more passive, like ""accepted."" It might also refer to a certain foolish hobbit, but we won’t get into that. So we need to ask if McCrory actively took the money, passively took the money, or both. Let’s start with passive taking. Did McCrory accept the money? Did he object to it? Veto power Cooper’s main argument during the debate was that McCrory didn’t object to the money being moved, since he allowed the bill in question to become law. ""The governor could’ve vetoed this legislation that took this $500,000 out of the Disaster Relief Fund, but he did not,"" Cooper said. ""He did not veto it."" The money came to McCrory on July 1 in a bill making multiple changes and corrections to the state budget. McCrory said he didn’t veto the bill because he didn’t want to risk stopping other important changes if his veto succeeded. But that excuse doesn’t hold water. The legislature could’ve easily overridden his veto, which requires a 60-percent majority to do. This bill received 46 of 50 votes in the Senate (92 percent) and 89 of 120 votes in the House (74 percent). McCrory has issued six vetoes as governor, four of which have been overridden. His latest came less than a month before this budget bill. At the time, he said it would probably be overridden but ""part of the reason to veto a bill is to make sure the public is aware of exactly what’s in a bill."" And less than a week before the funding bill came to his desk, he threatened to veto another bill over several parts that he didn’t like; the legislature rewrote those parts in response. However, after McCrory let the funding bill become law, he did almost immediately say he had no intention of actually using the money – a statement he repeated again at the debate. Show me the money So McCrory accepted the money with no strong formal objections, like a veto. We also know that McCrory asked for $500,000 to be set aside for lawyers for HB2 – that it wasn’t just imposed on him by the legislature. But both McCrory’s general counsel, Bob Stephens, and the office of Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger have said McCrory just asked for the money in general and never specifically suggested pulling it from disaster relief funds – so the legislature bears responsibility for that choice. But where’s the money now? The budget changes say that the $500,000 from the disaster relief fund ""shall be transferred to the Governor's Office"" for HB2’s legal costs. However, Berger’s office told us the money has yet to actually be transferred, despite the apparently authoritative wording of the law. ""As a practical matter, $500,000 has not been moved from the disaster relief fund,"" said Berger spokeswoman Shelly Carver. She added: ""Further, the governor has said he will not spend any disaster relief funds on legal expenses, which is within his discretion."" But similarly, McCrory also has the discretion to move the money in the future if he wants. And what’s less clear is whether the money could still move even against his wishes, since the law says the funds ""shall transfer"" to his office. The word ""shall"" is tricky in legal writing and we simply don’t know exactly how it might be interpreted here. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in 1995 that ""though shall generally means must, legal writers sometimes use, or misuse, shall to mean should, will or even may."" Our ruling Cooper said ""Governor McCrory took $500,000 directly out of the disaster relief fund"" to spend on lawyers to defend the controversial HB2 legislation. McCrory did ask for the money, although there’s no proof he asked for it to be taken specifically from disaster relief – an especially touchy topic now with so much flooding ravaging the state. The money is still in the disaster relief fund, which is a mark against Cooper’s claim, but nevertheless it is still earmarked for HB2, meaning McCrory could take it in the future. And although he has said he won’t, he also didn’t attempt to stop the money from being moved out of disaster relief by using his veto power",Half True,"October 19, 2016"
"Says Hillary Clinton and millennials have the same positions on climate change, abortion rights, immigration reform, gay rights and college affordability. ""Donald Trump doesn't.""","Young voters carried Barack Obama to victory in the past two elections and felt the Bern for Bernie Sanders during the 2016 Democratic primary. But polls show they’re not exactly transferring their enthusiasm to Hillary Clinton.  The 69.2 million millennials — typically defined as adults under age 35 — now make up the second-largest age block in America after the Baby Boomers. While Clinton still leads Donald Trump among young voters, polls show sizable portions of millennials now backing Libertarian Party’s Gary Johnson and Green Party’s Jill Stein. (In comparison, third party candidates received about 3 percent of the vote in 2012.)  Clinton’s trouble connecting with millennials prompted NBC’s Chuck Todd on Meet the Press to ask Clinton’s running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, how the campaign could rebuild the Obama coalition and win swing states without them. Kaine agreed that that young voters are crucial, but laid out ""five litmus test issues"" that should convince them to get with her. ""Do you believe in climate science or don’t you? Millennials do, Hillary Clinton and I do, Donald Trump doesn’t. Do you believe women should be able to make their own health care decisions, or don’t you? Millennials do, Hillary Clinton and I do, Donald Trump doesn’t. Do you believe in immigration reform or don’t you? We do, millennials do, Donald Trump doesn’t. Do you believe in LGBTQ equality? We do, millennials do, Donald Trump doesn’t. And finally, do you have a plan to deal with college affordability? We have one. Millennials need one. And Donald Trump, with Trump University, has ripped off students,"" Kaine said. Does Clinton have more in common with the youth than Trump on the five issues Kaine laid out? We asked the Clinton campaign and Trump campaigns for data showing how millennials feel about the various issues. We didn't hear back from the Trump side. A Clinton spokesman sent us a report that surveyed millennials in only 11 swing states. In addition, it used questions phrased to favor Democratic talking points, such as asking about ""making the wealthy pay their fair share"" and ""implementing common sense gun safety rules."" We will not be using those results. But the campaign later sent us other polling data. In addition, we did our own search. Here's what we found. Climate science Kaine’s assertion on climate change is largely accurate. Recently, a 2014 Gallup survey found that 58 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds believe global warming's effects have already begun. About a year later, a national poll conducted in 2015 by Harvard's Institute of Politics found that 55 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds agreed with the scientific consensus that the planet is warming and emissions ""from cars and industry facilities"" are to blame. But 20 percent said that, although the planet is warming, natural changes in the environment are to blame, which is at odds with the consensus of the experts. Twenty-three percent believe global warming is a ""theory that has not yet been proven.""         Clinton has called for more pollution controls, investing more in clean energy and cutting ""wasteful"" tax subsidies for oil and gas companies. Trump's website doesn’t include a position on climate change. However, the site has reposted a PBS Newshour article that says Trump regards climate change as a hoax. And as we reported in June, during a May 26 energy policy speech Trump advocated rescinding ""all the job-destroying Obama executive actions, including the Climate Action Plan"" and said he would ""cancel the Paris Climate Agreement and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs."" Women's health care Kaine said that women should be able to make their own health care decisions. Few people would disagree that women — or men for that matter — should be able to make their own health care decisions. In a political context, Kaine’s comments indicate Clinton’s position in favor of abortion rights. A 2014 poll by the nonpartisan organization PRRI (formerly the Public Religion Research Institute) in Washington found that 55 percent of millennials thought abortion should be legal in most or all cases. The same level of support is seen in people under 68. Only older Americans showed less support for abortion, with 43 percent of people over 67 saying it should be legal. Similarly, when Gallup surveyed abortion attitudes in 2015, it found that 53 percent of people age 18 to 34 identified themselves as ""pro choice,"" versus 52 percent of 35- to 55-year-olds and 47 percent of people over 55. Once again, that puts millennials in the Democratic camp, but not by an overwhelming amount. Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin subsequently directed us to a Fox News survey taken last week that found 61 percent of registered voters under age 35 reported being pro-choice. Clinton, as with most Democrats, supports the right of a woman to seek an abortion. Trump doesn't address abortion on his website, but he’s said in interviews that he opposes abortion in most cases. In a March interview, he said women who have an abortion after it’s outlawed should received ""some form of punishment,"" but he backtracked on the idea after widespread criticism. Once again, the Clinton-Kaine team seems to be in synch with at least a bare majority of millennials. Immigration Immigration is another issue where the stances of Trump and Clinton diverge dramatically. Trump has made the removal of illegal immigrants his signature issue. He wants to build a wall across the southern border and change the law that dictates that if you are born in the United States you automatically become as U.S. citizen. Clinton, in contrast, has called for legislation to allow some of those living in the United States illegally to remain, especially young adults brought to the United States as children. Most — criminals are a major exception — would be eligible for an eventual path to citizenship. On the issue of the wall, millennials are firmly against Trump. According to a 2016 PRRI survey, 70 percent oppose it, compared to 52 percent of people age 65 and older. Only 11 percent of Americans age 18 to 29 support identifying and deporting illegal immigrants (it's 23 percent for people age 65 and older), according to a 2015 PRRI poll; and 69 percent of younger voters support a path to citizenship, as do 58 percent of seniors. More recently, a Fox News poll taken in last August found that 87 percent of respondents under 35 favored setting up a system for illegal immigrants to become legal. Only 11 percent supported deporting as many as possible. Also, Trump seems to be out of step with the younger people in his own party, 63 percent of whom support a path to citizenship and only 20 percent want mass deportation. LGBT equality Polls show millennials overwhelmingly support gay rights, which is a plank of Clinton's platform. But Kaine is exaggerating when he suggests Trump is totally against LGBT equality — the Republican nominee has given mixed messages on the issue. An August GenForward survey, conducted by the Black Youth Project at the University of Chicago and the AP-NORC Center, found that young voters (defined as age 18 to 30) strongly supported LGBT individual rights including equal employment rights (90 percent), HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment (92 percent) and LGBT adoption (80 percent). According to a May 2016 Pew report, 71 percent of Americans born after 1981 favor same-sex marriage (as do 55 percent of all Americans). Clinton’s LGBT promises mirror the attitudes of millennials in the GenForward survey. She calls the Supreme Court ruling that legalized gay marriage in 2015 as a ""landmark victory"" for the country. Kaine, for his part, signed an executive order that banned discrimination based on sexual orientation in Virginia in 2006, his first year as governor. Equality Virginia, the commonwealth's LGBT organization, called him a friend and major ally in an editorial to the Advocate.  Trump, meanwhile, has vowed that he ""will do everything in my power to protect LGBT citizens"" in his speech at the Republican National Convention. He often criticizes the Clinton Foundation for taking donations from governments that oppress gay men and women. But Trump opposes gay marriage and has said in interviews during the Republican primary that he would appoint judges that would reverse the Supreme Court ruling or allow states to decide. The Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights groups that endorsed Clinton, points out that Trump’s running mate is Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, who passed a 2015 law that allowed businesses to refuse to serve gay and lesbian customers based on religious freedom; the law was modified after an uproar. College affordability Trump isn’t against making colleges more affordable, but polls show millennial attitudes on higher education costs are more closely aligned with Clinton’s than Trump’s. Many millennials say college affordability is a top issue, according to a USA Today/Rock the Vote survey, and the vast majority say higher education should be debt free (77 percent in a poll commissioned by Bankrate Inc., a financial services company). Under Clinton’s college affordability plan — retooled with input from Sanders in June 2016 and seen as a grab for his millennial voters — families with incomes less than $85,000 will pay no tuition at in-state public colleges and universities, with the income cap increasing to $125,000 by 2021. Clinton’s plan also addresses student debt refinancing. Kaine focused on complaints lodged against Trump University in his Meet the Press interview. We found that Trump University received a D-minus rating from the Better Business Bureau in 2010, the last time the consumer watchdogs gave any rating at all. Trump has been vague about his own college affordability plans. In an Iowa town hall in November 2015, he suggested he would create ""some governmental program"" to help lower-income families pay for school. He promised to ""work with all of our students who are drowning in debt"" during the Republican National Convention. His website does not list college affordability as an issue, but Trump’s policy advisor Sam Clovis floated a few ideas in a May interview with Inside Higher Ed. Clovis said the campaign thinks student loans should be ""market driven,"" and said colleges should ""have skin in the game"" and share the risks associated with student loans. Clovis rejected proposals for free higher public education. Our ruling Kaine said Hillary Clinton and millennials believe in climate change, abortion rights, immigration reform, gay rights and college affordability but ""Donald Trump doesn't."" Reputable polls back Kaine’s claim, though the VP nominee is overstating the extent of Trump’s opposition to gay rights and college affordability. Millennials agree decisively with Clinton’s position on immigration, gay rights and college affordability, and by narrow margins on climate change and abortion rights",Mostly True,"September 18, 2016"
"Says Dick Cheney ""supported gay marriage sooner"" than Hillary Clinton.","A viral online ad by a group supporting Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson features Abe Lincoln urging Americans to dump Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and vote for Johnson. The funny, five-minute video by AlternativePAC begins with the Lincoln impersonator standing outside a log cabin. ""Oh, hey America, it’s me, dead Abe Lincoln, and you just got screwed,"" he says, ""because you have to choose between a corrupt president or a crazy president."" ""Here’s Hillary, who’s like a Monopoly player using her get out of jail free card, then a rig an election card, and make millions on political favors card,"" Abe says. ""And Trump, who’s like if your racist uncle got drunk and ran for president, and then the nation got drunk and said, ‘That guy should have nuclear bombs.'"" Abe's pitch: Consider Gary Johnson, the former New Mexico governor, as a sensible third-party option. Since AlternativePAC posted the ad Aug. 25 on its website BalancedRebellion.com it has been viewed 18.3 million times on the group’s Facebook page. Among fake Abe’s many zingers, this one caught our attention: ""Hillary’s policies are the same as Dick Cheney’s, except Cheney supported gay marriage sooner!"" We did not fact-check the line that Hillary’s policies are the same as Dick Cheney's"" -- because their positions aren't identical, and it smacks of humorous hyperbole. Instead we focused on the claim that ""Cheney supported gay marriage sooner"" than Clinton. Same-sex marriage is a personal issue for Cheney, who served as vice president to President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2009. His second-oldest daughter, Mary Cheney, is openly gay and she married her longtime partner, Heather Poe, in 2012. She also served as a senior campaign advisor to her father during the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections. Cheney broke with conservative orthodoxy on same-sex marriage during his Oct. 5, 2000, vice presidential debate against Sen. Joe Lieberman. Debate moderator Bernie Bernard Shaw of CNN asked the candidates if gay couples should ""have all the constitutional rights enjoyed by every American citizen?"" ""The fact of the matter is we live in a free society, and freedom means freedom for everybody,"" Cheney replied. ""We don't get to choose, and shouldn't be able to choose and say, 'You get to live free, but you don't.' I think that means that people should be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to enter into."" (Watch the debate; Cheney discusses gay marriage at 1:17)   Cheney said the question of whether there should be an ""official sanction"" of same-sex relationships should be left to states -- which have traditionally overseen marriage laws. ""I don't think there should necessarily be a federal policy in this area,"" he added. Cheney’s stand drew criticism from conservatives and praise from gay groups, the New York Times reported. In his 2011 memoir, In My Time, Cheney wrote of his debate comments: ""I had given the issue a lot of thought and answered it from the heart. ...Of course, I had my daughter Mary and her partner, Heather Poe, in my mind, but I was also thinking about what's right for all of us as Americans if we truly believe in freedom."" During the Bush-Cheney 2004 re-election race, the vice president spelled out his differences on gay marriage with President Bush, who had endorsed a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, the Washington Post reported. For the first time, Cheney discussed the sexual orientation of his daughter, Mary. Asked his position on the issue at an Iowa town hall meeting, Cheney said: ""Lynne and I have a gay daughter, so it's an issue that our family is very familiar with. ... With respect to the question of relationships, my general view is that freedom means freedom for everyone. People ought to be able to free -- ought to be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to."" He again said that same-sex marriage should be left to the states to decide, while noting Bush’s endorsement of the amendment to prevent states from recognizing gay marriages. ""At this point ... my own preference is as I've stated,"" Cheney said. ""But the president makes basic policy for the administration. And he's made it. "" At a June 2009 National Press Club event, a journalist asked Cheney, given the Iowa Supreme Court's ruling legalizing game marriage at the time, ""is some form of legalized gay marriage inevitable in the United States?"" The former vice president repeated his mantra on the issue, saying, ""Freedom means freedom for everyone. And as many of you know, one of my daughters is gay, and something that we’ve lived with for a long time in our family. I think people ought to be free to enter into any kind of union they wish, any kind of arrangement they wish."" He appeared to positively view the movement by some states to legalize gay marriage. ""I think people ought to get a shot at that. And they do at present."" (Watch a video of Cheney's remarks.) Clinton's flip-flop As for Hillary Clinton, PolitiFact has reported that the Democratic presidential nominee opposed gay marriage for more than a decade before she came out in support of it in 2013. We found that as public opinion shifted toward support for same-sex marriage, so did Clinton. In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act, a law that defined federal marriage as a union between one man and one woman. It also denied same-sex couples access to federal benefits, including Social Security survivor benefits and health care benefits along with barring gay couples from filing joint federal tax returns and receiving income and estate tax benefits for spouses. Hillary Clinton began facing questions about same-sex marriage during her 2000 campaign for the U.S. Senate. In December 1999, Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson said she supported the Defense of Marriage Act, but added that ""same-sex unions should be recognized and that same-sex unions should be entitled to all the rights and privileges that every other American gets,"" the New York Times reported. In July 2004, Clinton spoke on the Senate floor saying she -- like Cheney -- opposed a proposed federal amendment to ban same-sex marriage. (The amendment ultimately failed.) Though she opposed it, she said that she believed that marriage was ""a sacred bond between a man and a woman."" But her opposition continued to soften as popular support for same-sex marriage increased. In October 2006, Clinton told a private gathering of gay elected officials that she would support same-sex marriage in New York if a future governor and Legislature chose to enact such a law.   During her 2008 run for president, Clinton backed away from the Defense of Marriage Act in a May 2007 questionnaire for the Human Rights Campaign: ""I support repealing the provision of DOMA that may prohibit the federal government from providing benefits to people in states that recognize same-sex marriage."" However, the New York Times reported that presidential candidate Clinton in 2008 continued to explicitly opposed same-sex marriage, saying that she favored civil unions but that decisions about the legality of marriage should be left to the states. As Clinton prepared for her second presidential bid, she announced her support for same-sex marriage in a video with the Human Rights Campaign on March 18, 2013. ""LGBT Americans are our colleagues, our teachers, our soldiers, our friends, our loved ones. And they are full and equal citizens, and they deserve the rights of citizenship. That includes marriage. That’s why I support marriage for lesbian and gay couples,"" she said. ""I support it personally and as a matter of policy and law, embedded in a broader effort to advance equality and opportunity for LGBT Americans and all Americans."" Our ruling AlternativePAC says ""(Dick) Cheney supported gay marriage sooner"" than Hillary Clinton. The historical record is clear. Cheney spoke out in favor of gay marriage during the 2000 vice presidential debate, saying, ""freedom means freedom for everybody… I think we ought to do everything we can to tolerate and accommodate whatever kind of relationships people want to enter into."" He said any ""official sanction"" of same-sex relationships should be left to states -- not the federal government. In the 2004 presidential election, Cheney broke with Bush, who supported a congressional amendment banning same-sex marriage. Clinton opposed same-sex marriage as a candidate for the Senate, while in office as a senator, and while running for president in 2008. She expressed her support for civil unions starting in 2000, opposed the proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage in 2004 and voiced support for the rights of states to set their own laws in favor of gay marriage in 2006. She came out in support of same-sex marriage in 2013",True,"September 8, 2016"
"Donald Trump is ""against marriage equality. He wants to go back.""","U.S. Rep. Sean Maloney, D-N.Y., called out Donald Trump during a speech to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia for the Republican nominee's position on same-sex marriage.  Maloney, who is openly gay and married, said Trump has opposed same-sex marriage and wants the Supreme Court to reverse its 2015 decision that legalized same-sex marriage throughout the United States. ""It matters who’s leading the country, and it matters if they care,"" said Maloney, whose Hudson Valley congressional district includes all of Putnam and Orange counties, part of northern Westchester County and the southwest section of Dutchess County. ""America, we have a choice. Donald Trump doesn’t care about some families. He’s against marriage equality. He wants to go back."" Trump has been criticized for flip-flopping on social issues. Is Maloney right about the Republican candidate’s stance on same-sex marriage? Trump through the years The earliest reference from Trump on the issue that we could track down is an interview in The Advocate in 2000. At the time Trump was rumored to be considering a run for president. ""I think the institution of marriage should be between a man and a woman,"" Trump said during the interview. He said he would favor a domestic partnership law that afforded same-sex couples the same benefits as married couples. Fast-forward to 2011 when Trump was again considering a run for the White House. He sat down for an interview with Bill O’Reilly on Fox News and talked about his position on same-sex marriage. ""I just don't feel good about it,"" Trump said. ""I don't feel right about it. I'm against it, and I take a lot of heat because I come from New York. You know, for New York it's like, how can you be against gay marriage? But I'm opposed to gay marriage."" And, last year Trump said in an interview on CNN that he supported ‘traditional marriage.’ ‘He wants to go back’ Maloney’s claim was made in the context of the Supreme Court’s 2015 decision on same-sex marriage. Trump does not agree with the decision. He has said efforts to overrule the court through an amendment to the U.S Constitution are not realistic. He has said in interviews that he would have preferred the court leave the decision on same-sex marriage at the state level. Trump also suggested in at least one interview that he would consider appointing Supreme Court justices who would support reversing the ruling. Our ruling Speaking at the Democratic National Convention, Maloney said Trump is ""against marriage equality"" and ""wants to go back"" on the Supreme Court’s same-sex marriage decision. Trump has consistently opposed same-sex marriage in interviews since 2000. He also said he would consider appointing justices to the Supreme Court who would favor reversing the decision and leave the issue of same-sex marriage to the states",True,"August 14, 2016"
"Says Gov. Mike Pence and Rep. Mike Coffman ""take the same positions on a number of things ... Coffman and Pence oppose equal rights for LGBT Americans.""","The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence and Colorado Republican Rep. Mike Coffman oppose gay rights. A July 20 DCCC news release says that Coffman, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Pence make for an ""extreme"" ticket and Trump and Coffman ""share many of the same dangerous ideas."" It compares Coffman’s and Pence’s record on eight different issues, from the minimum wage to abortion. The implication is that Pence and Coffman share the same positions, including on gay rights. ""Trump’s VP pick also makes perfect sense for Coffman, given that they take the same positions on a number of things like ... Coffman and Pence oppose equal rights for LGBT Americans,"" the release states. PolitiFact dug into the claim that Pence and Coffman ""take the same positions"" in their opposition to equal rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. The DCCC release tries to back up its claim by saying when Pence was an Indiana congressman in 2007, he said the Employment Non-Discrimination Act -- a bill known as ENDA that sought to prohibit employment discrimination against gay people -- ""wages war on freedom of religion in the workplace."" The release failed to mention that Coffman took a different approach; he co-sponsored a 2013 version of ENDA. In other words, Coffman supported legislation to prohibit workplace discrimination based on ""sexual orientation or gender identity"" that Pence opposed in 2007. We asked about the omission, and a DCCC spokesman said ""that was just for space"" given that the release was running five-pages long. The news release cited Coffman’s opposition to same-sex marriage, referring to Denver Post coverage of a 2014 election debate where he said, ""Certainly I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. Ultimately it’s going to be up to the voters of Colorado to make that decision. I will respect as a member of Congress whatever decision that they make."" In a series of yes-or-no questions, Coffman answered ""no"" when asked, ""Should Colorado recognize same-sex marriage?"" He also replied ""yes"" when asked, ""Do you support Colorado’s ban on same-sex marriage?""   After the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June 2015 that the Constitution guarantees a right to same-sex message, some Colorado Republican lawmakers condemned the decision. Coffman, however, said in a statement, ""The world is changing, and while I’ve supported traditional marriage, the court has ruled a ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional. It is time we move forward and focus on the big debates of our day — how to keep our country safe and get Americans back to work."" Coffman’s spokeswoman, Cinamon Watson, dismissed the DCCC attack as ""a bald-faced lie,"" saying Coffman is ""no Mike Pence"" on gay rights. She directed us to praise of Coffman by an array of LGBT organizations and Democratic flip-flopping on gay marriage by President Barack Obama and presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Supporting gay rights Coffman does have a mixed record on support for LGBT rights, which some attribute to the 2011 redistricting of his 6th Congressional District, which shifted from staunchly conservative to a more diverse, middle-of-the-road swath of Denver suburbs. Gay advocacy groups have lauded Coffman for taking certain stands. Examples include: He was also the only Republican to co-sponsor the Freedom from Discrimination in Credit Act of 2015, which seeks to expand the Equal Credit Opportunity Act to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. In addition, he voted for the Peters’ Amendment, which prohibits discrimination in federal transportation and housing programs and passed the House with strong bipartisan support.   Coffman’s support for LGBT rights contrasts with Mike Pence’s hard-line stand on social issues. In April 2015, Coffman was one of eight Republicans who penned a letter to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights praising the agency's first-ever briefing dedicated to discrimination against LGBT Americans, The Hill reported. The letter came in the aftermath of the controversy over an Indiana religious freedom law signed by Pence, who later signed a revised measure facing business boycotts and a firestorm of criticism. ""(Coffman) is as not as extreme as Mike Pence, and I would say not many people are as extreme as Mike Pence,"" Austin Montoya, spokesman for One Colorado, told PolitiFact. Opposing gay rights Coffman has taken other positions, though, that advocates of gay rights don’t like. Montoya cited Coffman’s votes against repealing the military’s ""Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell"" policy, and his support of the Defense of Marriage Act (before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the law that denied federal benefits to same-sex couples in 2013). And while Coffman did co-sponsor the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which failed to become law, Montoya noted that Coffman has not co-sponsored the more expansive Equality Act, which would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include discrimination protection based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Our ruling A DCCC news release said, ""Coffman and Pence oppose equal rights for LGBT Americans."" The release stated that Coffman and Pence ""take the same positions on a number of things,"" including on gay rights. DCCC and other critics have a point in saying Coffman opposed same-sex marriage, repealing the military’s ""Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell"" policy and he supported the Defense of Marriage Act.    But he has backed legislation to protect gay Americans from discrimination in the workplace, in securing credit, in federal transportation and housing programs and in military benefits. Advocacy groups have praised Coffman’s support on some protections and said he is not as steadfast an opponent as Pence.

"""The LGBT community is more often the victims of hate crimes than any other recognized group.""","The Orlando shooting massacre at the Pulse gay nightclub that led to the deaths of 49 victims has led to more national attention about hate crimes targeting the gay community. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch spoke about the attack hours later on Fox News Sunday. ""I think we have to keep our eye on a larger picture here, which is the victims of this crime were from a community that is often marginalized and that, frankly, the LGBT community is more often the victims of hate crimes than any other recognized group,"" she said. Lynch is correct if we examine per capita rates for hate crimes, although there are some caveats about the data -- mainly that there are gaps in how law enforcement reports hate crimes. The FBI defines hate crimes as ""criminal offenses motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender’s bias against"" a particular group such as a religion, race or sexual orientation. Data on hate crimes A spokesman for Lynch said she was referring to an analysis by the New York Times published days after the Orlando shooting. Using data from the FBI and the U.S. Census, the newspaper compared hate crimes per capita in two years: 2005 and 2014. The newspaper found ""L.G.B.T. people are twice as likely to be targeted as African-Americans, and the rate of hate crimes against them has surpassed that of crimes against Jews."" Mark Potok, an expert on extremism at the Southern Poverty Law Center, did a similar analysis of 14 years of hate crime data in 2011. He found that LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) people are far more likely than other minority groups to be victimized by violent hate crimes. Potok examined the percentage of the population represented by these groups:  LGBT, Jews, blacks, Muslims, Latinos and whites. Then he compiled the total number of hate crimes against persons (excluding crimes against property) between 1995 and 2008. Then he compared the level of hate crime aimed at each group to the group’s percentage in the population to determine the rate of victimization. He found that LGBT people were victimized at 8.3 times the expected rate. Jews were victimized at 3.5 times the expected rate, blacks at 3.2 times, Muslims at 1.9 times, Latinos at 0.6 times, and whites at 0.2 times. An important caveat: There are several holes in the reporting of hate crimes to the FBI. Local law enforcement agencies voluntarily report their data to a state agency that compiles the information for the FBI. Some local agencies report no hate crimes or don’t submit a report. A study by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics found that 60 percent of violent hate crime victimizations were not reported to police in 2012. A 2016 Associated Press investigation found that more than 2,700 city police and county sheriff's departments have not submitted a single hate crime report to the FBI during the past six years — about 17 percent of all city and county law enforcement agencies nationwide. Among the agencies that reported zero hate crimes in 2014 were several major cities, including Jacksonville, Miami and Tampa. Another way to look at the data about hate crimes rather than per capita is the sheer number of crimes. By that measure, there were more hate crimes against African-Americans than LGBT residents. But that’s not surprising since African-Americans represent about 13.2 percent of the population according to the U.S. Census, while the LGBT community represents about 2.3 percent of the population, according to a survey done by the Centers for Disease Control (other surveys found a slightly higher rate.) Why would LGBT be victimized at a higher rate Answering the question as to why the LGBT community would be victimized at a higher rate is more complex. Some of the crime, paradoxically, may be motivated by more widespread acceptance of gay rights. ""We are seeing lots more gay people getting married,"" said Jack Levin, a sociologist at Northeastern University and expert on hate crimes. ""I think what hate crimes represent is a reaction to that."" Some are motivated by fear. ""There is a visceral hatred against LGBT people in large part connected to fears about sexuality,"" Potok said. ""Sexuality is an incredibly fraught topic for some people and especially those people who fear they might have same-sex attraction themselves."" Law enforcement is still investigating the Orlando shooting, but based on information so far, experts said that the shooter appeared to be motivated in part by bigotry and self-loathing. Omar Mateen, who was married to a woman, regularly visited the gay nightclub and used gay dating apps, according to reports by patrons at the club. Our ruling Lynch said, ""The LGBT community is more often the victims of hate crimes than any other recognized group."" It’s worth noting that there may be widespread underreporting of hate crime incidents in general. However, the best available research shows that the LGBT community is victimized at a higher rate than other minority groups, according to FBI data",True,"June 23, 2016"
"""A gay man who survived #orlando hate crime can STILL show up to work in FL tomorrow and have his boss fire him simply because he is gay.""","As the motive behind the deadly June 12 shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando was still being debated, singer Clay Aiken took to Twitter to characterize it as a hate crime and report that gays can be summarily fired in Florida simply because of their sexual orientation. ""A gay man who survived #orlando hate crime can STILL show up to work in FL tomorrow and have his boss fire him simply because he is gay,"" Aiken tweeted. For this fact check, we will look at whether Florida really offers no job protection to gays and lesbians. The short answer: Aiken is mostly correct when it comes to Florida as a whole, but he's wrong to suggest that there is no protection anywhere in the state. Federal law does not protect the employment rights of the LGBT community, nor does the state of Florida. However, thanks to city and county law, members of the LGBT community do have employment protection in some areas of Florida. Currently, 10 counties and 19 cities, including Tampa, St. Petersburg, Miami, Miami Beach, St. Augustine, Sarasota and Orlando, have passed protections for gay workers, according to Frank Penela, communications director for the Florida Commission on Human Relations. Penela also reported that although state law doesn't specifically reference LGBT status in employment, ""the Commission will accept some cases under sex-based discrimination.  Allegations of gender identity/transgender discrimination, for example, can be viewed as sex discrimination."" Aiken spokesman Josh Pultz noted that bills designed to add protection for gender identity and sexual orientation died in Florida's House and Senate in 2016. ""Regardless of existing employment anti discrimination ordinances protecting LGBT in at least 31 municipalities, covering as many as 15 counties in the state, the state does not provide such protections — leaving LGBT workers in as many as 52 of the 67 counties without any protection from being terminated because of their orientation,"" Pultz said in an email. ""Clay's comment stated nothing more than that a gay man in Florida can still be fired for being gay. It did not specify any certain municipality and therefore is factually accurate,"" he wrote. According to the American Civil Liberties Union's website, 22 states and the District of Columbia prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. The District and 19 states also ban discrimination based on gender identity. That makes Florida one of 28 states with no statewide protection against discrimination. Our ruling Aiken tweeted, ""A gay man who survived #orlando hate crime can STILL show up to work in FL tomorrow and have his boss fire him simply because he is gay."" That is generally true across the state, because gays and lesbians lack protection from employment discrimination under state law and under federal law. However, 19 Florida cities often offer protection to gay workers, including the city of Orlando.

"Says Nevada lawmakers voted to allow teenaged boys to ""shower with your teenaged girls in public school locker rooms.""","Several Republican state Assembly hopefuls are using campaign mail pieces to try and tie Nevada lawmakers to the debate surrounding bathroom access for transgender students. One such ad by Assembly candidate Steve Sanson depicts Assembly Majority Leader Paul Anderson looming over a bathroom stall, with overlaid text reading: ""Now teenaged boys can shower with your teenaged girls in public school locker rooms."" Another from Assembly hopeful Blaine Jones depicts his primary opponent, Assemblyman Derek Armstrong, peering over a bathroom stall and implying that the Republican supports transgender bathrooms. Given recent headlines over bathroom access for transgender students, we thought it was worth checking into how Nevada deals with the issue. Legislative flashback Nevada lawmakers did tackle a bill in 2015 that would have required all students to use the bathroom that corresponded to their biological sex. After heated debate, Assembly members voted down the proposed bill with five Republicans (including freshman Armstrong, another mailer target) breaking rank and joining Democrats to defeat the measure. But the mailers themselves appear to be referring to another bill, SB504, which established a statewide anti-bullying program and was approved by all but a handful of legislators. The vast majority of that specific bill dealt with setting up a new statewide anti-bullying office and setting stricter requirements for reporting and investigating bullying. Several activists seized upon a 2015 legislative briefing released by the conservative Christian group Alliance Defending Freedom, which interpreted the new law as creating a ""new right"" for transgender students to access the bathrooms and shower rooms of their choice. In an endorsement letter, Assemblyman Ira Hansen said the new law ""mandated every school district in Nevada make all facilities ‘gender neutral.’"" But the law itself isn’t that clear-cut. A tangled legal web A mandate on bathroom access for transgender students is part of an ongoing legal debate that still doesn’t have a clear answer. UNLV law professor Ann McGinley says several federal courts have issued rulings indicating that transgender students fit under Title IX protections for gender equality, but any finality on a federal level will likely come from a future Supreme Court decision. McGinley says the question then falls to the state level, where the law is unclear. There’s nothing in state law that specifically mandates transgender students have the right to use the bathroom of the gender they identify with, but Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval’s office says the issue is essentially settled through the state’s broadly focused anti-discrimination laws. Lawmakers in 2011 expanded the state’s anti-discrimination laws to include gender identity and expression. Because these ""public accommodation"" laws cover ""place(s) of education,"" presumably school districts can’t segregate transgender students from using the gendered bathroom they identify with without violating state law. ""No change in policy is necessary and the Obama administration has no need to have concerns about Nevada schools,"" Sandoval spokeswoman Mari St. Martin said in an earlier statement. So how does the anti-bullying bill — SB504 — fit into the debate? Nestled in the bill are several new definitions of bullying, including ""blocking access to any property or facility of a school."" The Alliance Defending Freedom brief uses that definition, along with the addition of gender identity or expression into classes protected by the legislation, to argue that it creates a ""new right"" for transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice. Sanson, one of the ""insurgent Republicans"" running against Anderson, referred to the ADF brief in several blog posts on his website, which also included letters from Assembly members Hansen and Shelly Shelton. ""President Obama recently federally mandated all locker-rooms and bathrooms be designated ‘gender-neutral’, but it was already Nevada law because of Anderson’s leadership,"" Hansen said in a letter. Anderson called the brief ""irrelevant"" in an interview with PolitiFact. He said the legislation itself was designed to create general anti-bullying guidelines and that the bill’s language was left intentionally vague. ""The goal was to create a vague definition so that school districts could apply their own policies,"" he said. ""To spin it in any other way is frankly disingenuous,"" he added. McGinley says defining the law as creating a ""new right"" is probably too broad, but it’s possible the new anti-bullying legislation creates additional legal standing in the event a school district is challenged in court over their policies around transgender students. That’s similar to how the Nevada branch of the American Civil Liberties Union plans to tackle the issue, according to the group’s policy director Holly Welborn. She said the ACLU has received several complaints related to transgender student bathroom access, but any lawsuit brought by the civil liberties group would likely stand on the already-existing public accommodation laws. ""It (SB504) certainly isn’t creating a new right, it’s a right that already exists,"" Welborn said. Different statewide standards Transgender student access to bathrooms and other school facilities is largely dependent on individual policies of school districts. The Obama administration used transgender student policy of the Washoe County School District in Reno as an example of best practices for other school districts to follow. The district approved regulations last year allowing students to ""use facilities that correspond to their gender identity as expressed by the student and asserted at school"" including access to locker rooms. It’s a different case in the rural Elko County, where in 2015 one transgender student’s request to use male-designated school facilities was rejected by the local school board (requiring the student to use unisex bathrooms instead). Elko school district officials told a local newspaper that they interpreted the Obama administration’s letter as a ""political statement"" and would continue to make decisions on transgender student access on a case-by-case basis. But the vast majority of Nevada’s students are in the Clark County School District (in Las Vegas), which has yet to approve district-wide regulations for transgender students. The district circulated an internal draft in 2014 that would have set a more defined policy for transgender student equal access, but it was never made public. Despite a board member’s 2015 request for clarity, the district has yet to approve any policy changes for transgender student access, instead making decisions on a case-by-case basis. District spokeswoman Michelle Booth said efforts to adopt a policy are ongoing. ""The Clark County School District has received the ‘Letter to Colleagues’ from the U.S. Department of Education and is currently studying the details closely to determine what if any changes we will have to make to remain in compliance with federal guidelines,"" she said in an emailed statement. McGinley said the uncertainty on federal and state levels means there’s no clear evidence of a mandate on allowing transgender students the right to use the bathroom of the gender they identify with. ""Each county and school district are making these determinations based on how much risk they’re willing to take,"" she said. Our ruling Several Republican Assembly candidates are claiming that legislators are forcing ""boys to shower with girls."" Putting aside questions about the nature of gender, these ads just aren’t accurate. They refer to a piece of legislation that mostly deals with creating new anti-bullying policies. There is no clearly defined mandate in Nevada state law regarding transgender student access to bathrooms and locker rooms, and school districts around the state have very different standards county-to-county. Given the likelihood of future litigation on both a federal and state level, it’s misleading to connect a vaguely worded anti-bullying bill to the much more complicated area of transgender student rights",False,"June 13, 2016"

Pat McCrory’s talking points during his many interviews on HB2, the controversial new state law, is that the pro-LGBT group Human Rights Campaign is an immensely powerful group that’s stifling debate. On May 24 his campaign sent out a mass email with a link to a radio interview he had done that morning, asking people to listen. So we did, and a minute in, we heard the familiar refrain. The Human Rights Campaign ""is probably the most powerful special interest group out of Washington, D.C.,"" McCrory said in the interview, with Charlotte station WBT. ""And it's funded – their funders? We don't know who funds them, but they have about $32 million a year."" We previously rated False his claim that the group is more powerful than the National Rifle Association. For this fact check, however, we were intrigued by McCrory’s claim that ""we don’t know who funds them."" This interview wasn’t the first time McCrory has made a statement like that, so we figured we ought to look into it. Political nonprofits known as 501(c)(4) groups, like the HRC, are not required to disclose their donors. But the HRC does so voluntarily, at least for its large corporate donors. That’s the first crack in McCrory’s argument. The Human Rights Campaign files public Form 990 tax records each year, said spokesman Brandon Lorenz. That’s good; doing otherwise would be unlawful. ""Additionally, we voluntarily and proudly annually publish a list of our major donors in Equality Magazine, our quarterly magazine that both lives online and is mailed to approximately 350,000 homes,"" Lorenz said. That is also true. The magazine lists dozens of major sponsors, although it doesn’t say how much they gave to reach the various levels of sponsorship, which are bronze, silver, gold and platinum. We reached out to McCrory’s campaign with this information and asked if there was anything we were missing or misunderstanding about his claim, but we never heard back. In total, the Spring 2016 issue of Equality Magazine lists 47 ""corporate partners"" and 32 ""foundation partners."" Some show up in both lists, like Microsoft and Nike, while others only show up in one. The corporate donors contributed toward the group’s total revenues, which tax records show was $37.4 million for the year between April 2014 and March 2015 – actually a bit higher than what McCrory said in the interview. The list of partners reveals a menagerie of supporters: Banking, pharmaceutical, energy and tech giants alongside companies like vodka distiller Ketel One and defense contractor Northrop Grumman. For the full list of corporate sponsors, see page 31 of the print magazine’s Spring 2016 edition or page 32-33 in the online magazine. Identifying PAC donors But much of the money donated to the nonprofit as a whole can go to more mundane expenses like salaries, rent, travel and educational initiatives. What about the explicitly political giving? In 2016 so far, the group’s PAC and super PAC – which are used to give directly to candidates or purchase ads – have raised a combined $1.37 million. And for that money, we know not only the names of every major donor but also how much they gave, where they live and what they do. It’s all listed in publicly available Federal Election Commission reports, which are helpfully aggregated by the Center for Responsive Politics at www.opensecrets.org. Of the 10 largest individual donations to the group’s PAC, called Human Rights Campaign 2016, three were from North Carolina residents. The names, occupations, hometowns, dates and giving amounts of anyone who donated more than $200 are listed. So far, there have been 396 such donations – but 70 percent of the PAC’s $1,052,936 was donated in increments of less than $200, from donors who are not required to be identified, and whom the HRC does not identify voluntarily. As for the super PAC, called Human Rights Campaign Equality Votes 2016, the group lists 265 donations of more than $200 this election cycle. Unlike the PAC, these large donations accounted for the majority of the $316,154 donated to the super PAC. One notable donation was the $1,000 from Robert Williams, co-owner of the North Carolina design company Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams, which is itself a platinum-level corporate sponsor of the HRC. There was also $2,500 from Joni Madison, who recently left the Durham ad agency McKinney to become the HRC’s chief operations officer. Combined, all these publicly listed donations from North Carolina and elsewhere add up to more than $500,000 out of the total $1.37 million raised by the PAC and Super PAC. Our ruling McCrory is clearly wrong that ""We don't know who funds them."" In the case of the group’s overall budget, we know the name of 47 corporations who are major contributors, ranging from Nationwide Insurance to Starbucks. We don’t know much they gave, but we can at least see how they stack up in a tiered sponsorship system. In the case of the purely political donations, we don’t know the identity of the majority of the donors, who gave in small amounts. But an easy search of public data shows hundreds of people, from business owners and activists to farmers and dentists, who gave more than $200 to the group’s PAC and Super PAC, along with how much they gave. The Human Rights Campaign is not fully transparent, but it’s more transparent than other so-called dark money groups",Mostly False,"May 27, 2016"
"""We've already lost $500 million in economic impact"" from HB2 fallout in North Carolina.","In calling on state leaders to repeal House Bill 2, a Democratic state representative – Chris Sgro, who also leads a group suing over the new law – cited both his moral opposition and the financial backlash North Carolina has suffered. ""We've already lost $500 million in economic impact and now we are violating federal civil rights law and risking Title IX funding,"" Sgro said in a press release after the Obama administration announced its belief that HB2 violates various federal laws. ""This is a travesty and embarrassment for North Carolina."" The General Assembly passed HB2 in March. The wide-ranging state law includes a requirement that people in government facilities use bathrooms that match the gender on their birth certificate. A number of businesses, performing artists, conventions and more have announced boycotts of the Tar Heel State in response. That led Sgro (who was appointed to the General Assembly after HB2 passed and is the only openly gay legislator in North Carolina) to claim the law has cost North Carolina half a billion dollars. North Carolina’s gross domestic product in 2015 was about $500 billion. So a $500 million loss wouldn’t be that much in the grand scheme of things. But it would still be important for the individuals and businesses who had counted on having that money. ‘Really tangible losses’ Sgro said he was quoting a study from the Center for American Progress (CAP). The D.C.-based liberal think tank published a study April 13 that detailed the actual and potential economic losses through 2018, due to boycotts over HB2. North Carolina had already lost $86.3 million by mid-April, according to the report. So why did Sgro say $500 million a short time later? It’s worth noting that the CAP study isn’t the only one – Time Warner Cable News put the losses at $77 million. But since Sgro said he was citing the CAP study, we’ll look at that one. Reading further, the CAP report goes on to say that North Carolina could lose an additional $481.2 million in the future, for a total of $567.5 million. That’s the number Sgro said he was referring to. The key here is the distinction the report makes between money that’s at risk versus money already lost. In an interview, though, Sgro defended combining the two. And his group, Equality NC, later repeated the figure in a second press release. ""I really think the higher number is the more accurate way to couch the economics of this,"" he said. ""There are some really tangible losses already."" There are indeed tangible losses. But even throwing in an estimated, yet-to-be-verified loss suffered by the High Point Furniture Market – which happened between when the study was released and when Sgro made his remarks – the ""already lost"" tally still isn’t even half of the $500 million Sgro claimed. We double-checked each of the individual losses listed in the study that made up the $86.3 million figure and were able to confirm all of them except for $3 million attributed to Lionsgate pulling a comedy film crew from Charlotte. CAP used an outdated report to come to that conclusion; we found a more recent report that put it about $1 million lower. The CAP study was released before Asheville announced more than $1 million in losses after a conference cancellation. Since that essentially cancels out the difference, we’ll continue to use the $86.3 million cited by CAP. Sgro said there are also losses that can’t be counted, like businesses that have quietly decided not to consider coming to North Carolina. Google’s venture capital branch has also pledged not to invest in North Carolina, and several studios have said they won’t film in the Tar Heel State – all losses that are difficult to quantify. ""It’s significant, and it's compounding every single day we don't repeal the bill,"" Sgro said. Still, though, those are future potential losses – not money that has already been lost or pulled. And we weren’t convinced by the argument that it’s accurate to lump the two together. That’s because a closer look shows that many of the companies listed in the CAP study haven’t actually promised to pull their investments out of North Carolina if HB2 remains state law. ESPN ""said it’s re-evaluating its plans,"" to bring the X Games to Charlotte, according to the Charlotte Observer. That’s a potential loss estimated at $50 million, but it might not happen even if HB2 remains the law. The same goes for another $127.5 million from Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, Red Ventures, the NCAA and various conferences in Raleigh. In each of those cases, the groups said only that they would reconsider plans in North Carolina. None said for certain that HB2 would derail those plans. Two big hits The NBA has been more certain about moving its 2017 All Star Game from Charlotte if HB2 remains intact, but that’s still only a potential loss – and one that the CAP study may have over-exaggerated. The study lists its economic impact as $195 million. That’s the same number estimated for the 2015 All Star game in New York City. But not only has the accuracy of that 2015 estimate been called into question, it’s also worth asking if New York is really the best comparison. When doing its own estimates, the City of Charlotte used the 2014 All Star game in New Orleans, a city much closer in size, tourism draw and prices than New York. That game likely brought New Orleans a much lower impact of $106 million. And what about CAP’s estimated $143.4 million from High Point Furniture Market losses? The law was condemned by many businesses and trade associations connected to the twice-yearly market, which has generated more than $5 billion in recent years and has been called North Carolina’s largest economic event. The $143.4 million number would represent a small decline in its economic impact. But we have no way of knowing whether it’s an accurate estimate. Tom Conley, the market’s CEO, told us the market is still trying to get an accurate count of this April’s attendance and any possible losses. But for the sake of argument, we’ll give CAP and Sgro the benefit of the doubt here. Using CAP’s formula and attendance numbers from previous spring shows, we calculated that of the $143.4 million that could be lost at some point, $55.4 million could’ve already been lost at last month’s market. A researcher with CAP told us he thinks the group’s number was even a bit conservative, pointing to a story from CBS News that estimated the losses from this spring alone could hit $115 million. Neither number, though, gets Sgro’s ""already lost"" claim even close to $500 million. If the CAP estimates on the furniture market turn out to be accurate, then combined with the $86.3 million in already lost and documented funds, we come to a total of $141.7 million already lost from North Carolina’s economy. That’s less than a third of what Sgro said. Using the CBS estimate for the furniture market, the total rises to $201.3 million. Finally, it’s important to note that that some of the already-lost money might even return to North Carolina in the future. PayPal and Deutsche Bank stopped plans to hire hundreds of workers, but they also both said they might change their minds if HB2 is repealed. Our ruling North Carolina’s economy has already lost, by various counts, either $77 million, $86.3 million, $141.7 million or $201.3 million. None of those are even close to the $500 million Sgro claimed has already been lost. It’s true that the state might eventually lose up to $567.5 million in economic impact, according to one study. Sgro was using that number, but the vast majority of that money hasn’t already been lost, like he claimed it had been. What’s more, many of the businesses threatening boycotts haven’t even said for certain that they will cancel if HB2 remains law, meaning the $567.5 million figure could drop substantially. And if HB2 is repealed, it’s also possible that some of the ""already lost"" money might return in the form of new jobs and investments",False,"May 16, 2016"
"Says 80 percent of North Carolinians support ""the concept that men should not be in women’s restrooms, changing rooms, bathrooms, etc.""","As the battle over who should be able to use what bathroom rages on in North Carolina and nationwide, opponents of transgender-friendly rules say public opinion is on their side. Tim Moore, the speaker of the N.C. House of Representatives, said it’s an overwhelming consensus. ""The one thing where we’ve seen nearly unanimous – well, nothing’s unanimous – but 80 percent support out there is the concept that men should not be in women’s restrooms, changing rooms, bathrooms, et cetera – that that shouldn’t happen,"" Moore said in a May 5 discussion with reporters. We looked into polling on bathroom policy and found a wide range of results. Most don’t reach 80 percent, but clearly substantial numbers of people in North Carolina have told pollsters they oppose letting transgender people choose what bathroom to use. Polls have found safety concerns are also on some people’s minds. No one can say that there will never be any privacy or safety issues – of course there could be. But in a previous fact check, we looked for instances of sexual predators using the cover of transgender-friendly bathroom laws to dress up as the other sex and prey on people in bathrooms, the scenario many have said they’re concerned about. We found it Mostly True that such a scenario has never happened. We didn’t give it a True because there have been a few unproven allegations in the U.S. and one conviction in Canada. The Obama administration also hasn’t put stock in those concerns, and has said banning transgender people from the bathroom of the gender with which they identify is a civil rights violation. It was in that context, along with the administration’s threat to withhold federal funding from North Carolina, that Moore made his ""nearly unanimous,"" ""80 percent"" claim. Uncertainty abounds We did find one poll from the conservative Raleigh-based Civitas Institute that was close to backing up Moore’s claim. We’re not sure if it’s the poll he was citing or if he was citing a poll at all – Moore didn’t respond to our questions – but we’ll proceed anyway. The poll asked: ""Do you agree or disagree with a Virginia federal court ruling ordering girls and boys in public middle schools to share locker room, bathroom and shower facilities? The poll did find that 80 percent of people said they disagreed with the court ruling. However, we have several issues with the question. The question is not only leading and inflammatory but also fundamentally misconstrues what the court ruled. No boys and girls were ordered to shower, change or use the bathroom together. Instead, a federal appeals court ruled that a judge in Virginia had to reconsider a transgender boy’s request to use the boys’ facilities at school. The court also said the Obama administration acted legally in defining sex-based discrimination to include discrimination against transgender people. That’s the part that may have given rise to the poll question’s wording, since the student is likely to win now. Yet the Obama administration has repeatedly said that although schools should recognize transgender students’ rights, schools should also recognize other students’ right to privacy and that no student should be forced to openly share a changing area. In school districts around the country that have already recognized transgender students’ gender identities, officials have typically put private stalls in locker rooms and/or offered unisex one-person bathrooms. Given the issues with that question, let’s look at another. Another earlier poll from Civitas asked people a more accurate and nuanced question about transgender people in bathrooms, describing the arguments on both sides. This poll came before the state overturned Charlotte’s LGBT ordinance. ""The Charlotte City Council passed a new bathroom ordinance for transgender people that allows biological men and biological women, who identify as the opposite sex, to use the bathroom or locker room of their choosing,"" the question stated, asking people to pick sides. Nearly 70 percent said they opposed the idea. Not 80 percent, but close. But what about polls from groups with less political bias? According to a joint poll from SurveyUSA in partnership with Time Warner Cable News, 51 percent of North Carolinians think transgender people should not be able to choose which bathroom to use. That’s not ""nearly unanimous"" like Moore said; it’s barely a majority. Another joint poll from SurveyUSA and a different TV station, WRAL, found 56 percent in agreement that transgender people shouldn’t be able to choose which bathroom to use – again, a majority, but not close to 80 percent. Our ruling A prominent conservative group, Civitas, did find 70 and 80 percent in two polls, although we had some serious doubts about the question that found the 80 percent support. Two polls from the less partisan SurveyUSA in partnership with local TV stations have found 56 percent and 51 percent of North Carolinians support the idea. That’s still a majority, but it’s certainly not the ""nearly unanimous,"" ""80 percent support"" that Moore claimed",Half True,"May 14, 2016"
"Says Bruce Springsteen ""only had 8,000 tickets sold"" for a Greensboro show and canceled after ""they didn’t get the ticket sales they wanted.""","Gov. Pat McCrory took shots at critics of North Carolina’s controversial new law, commonly known as HB2, during a morning radio appearance May 3 on The John Boy and Billy Big Show. The law banned transgender people from using the bathroom of the gender they identify as, banned cities from enacting their own minimum wages or LGBT-friendly discrimination laws and got rid of anyone’s ability to file a discrimination lawsuit in state court. It was widely panned by progressive politicians as well as entertainers, some of whom even canceled shows in the Tar Heel State. On the show McCrory, with encouragement from John Boy and Billy, went through a laundry list of critics he said were mistaken or hypocritical. The show’s titular hosts – two down-home comedians with a conservative bent – are based in Charlotte and are broadcast in the morning rush hour throughout the country, primarily on rock stations. So it was no surprise that Bruce Springsteen’s name was brought up – although it was McCrory, not the hosts, who broached the subject of the rocker who is arguably the biggest name to have canceled a show in North Carolina over the new law. ""Some things are more important than a rock show, and this fight against prejudice and bigotry – which is happening as I write – is one of them,"" Springsteen wrote April 8 in announcing the decision to cancel his April 10 show. McCrory, however, implied that perhaps The Boss doesn’t command the adoration he once did – and that his cancellation was actually a ploy to avoid the embarrassing optics of a half-empty concert. ""I love Bruce Springsteen,"" McCrory said. ""I love his music. But he canceled a concert in Greensboro. By the way, they only had 8,000 tickets sold, with all respect. Hmm. But Bruce doesn’t mention that. They didn’t get the ticket sales they wanted."" That got a hearty laugh from everyone on set, and McCrory later repeated that 8,000 number. Where'd he hear that? Here at PolitiFact North Carolina, we’ve seen our fair share of videos from Springsteen’s live shows (mostly to marvel at Nils Lofgren’s guitar solos). The crowds are always sizeable, if not sold out. We would be quite surprised if Springsteen had sold only half the tickets to his Greensboro show just two days before the concert. The Greensboro Coliseum, where he had been scheduled to play, can seat more than 20,000 people. Stadium officials said the capacity for the Springsteen concert was actually about 16,000 due to stage and seating logistics. So that 8,000 number, if true, would say a lot about Springsteen – especially keeping in mind that the Coliseum tracks attendance for all of its shows, and Bruuuuuuuuuuuce has two of the 20 largest crowds in stadium history. But those were years ago, in 2002 and 2009. Is McCrory right that North Carolinians in 2016 don’t care much for the Jersey rocker’s music, much less his liberal views? Was he really only using a convenient political stance to cover up embarrassing sales numbers? No, according to the Greensboro Coliseum. Andrew Brown, the arena’s PR director, told us Springsteen had sold more than 15,000 tickets. ""No idea where 8,000 may have come from,"" Brown said, adding that there were fewer than 100 tickets left when Springsteen canceled with two days’ notice. ""It’s safe to say it would have sold out,"" he said. Like Brown, we also have no idea where the 8,000 number came from. McCrory’s campaign hasn’t responded to our questions, but we’ll update this if we hear back. The Greensboro Coliseum previously reported that Springsteen’s cancellation cost it $100,000. Pearl Jam, Ringo Starr, Demi Lovato/Nick Jonas and Ani DiFranco have also canceled, while such acts as Jimmy Buffett, Beyonce and Mumford & Sons have played but spoken out against the law from on stage or in written statements. As for Springsteen, the more-than-15,000-tickets number is the same figure the coliseum reported immediately after the cancellation, which was weeks before McCrory questioned the attendance. We appreciate the consistency, which keeps us from dancing in the dark to try to figure out the truth. Our ruling McCrory was way off on the number of tickets sold, which was widely reported before his radio appearance. What's more, he used that incorrect number to suggest that was why Springsteen canceled. In fact, the arena said the show was on the verge of selling out, not half empty.

"Says Donald Trump thinks ""a grown man pretending to be a woman (should) be allowed to use the women's restroom.""","Donald Trump wants to let male predators masquerading as women in the same bathrooms as your wife and daughter, according to an ominous black-and-white ad from presidential rival Ted Cruz. The ad refers to Trump’s stance on North Carolina’s controversial HB 2 (sometimes dubbed the bathroom bill), the subject of repeated criticism and jokes by Cruz. (Here’s one: ""If Donald Trump dresses up as Hillary Clinton, he still can’t go to the girls’ bathroom."") ""Should a grown man pretending to be a woman be allowed to use the women's restroom? The same restroom used by your daughter? Your wife? Donald Trump thinks so,"" reads the ad, which first aired April 22 and includes a clip of Trump suggesting people use the bathroom that ""they feel is appropriate."" ""It's not appropriate,"" the ad continues. ""It's not safe. It's PC nonsense that's destroying America. Donald Trump won't take on the PC police. He's one of them.""   Did the Cruz ad accurately describe Trump’s view? Not really. The businessman's comments on HB 2 suggest he doesn't really see allowing bathroom choice for transgender people as a problem. But by prohibiting people from using the bathroom they feel is appropriate, Trump said, North Carolina has hurt its business potential.   Further, medical experts typically agree that a transgender woman is a woman who identifies differently from her assigned sex at birth, though there isn’t universal agreement on this point. So it’s not entirely accurate for Cruz to define a transgender woman as ""a grown man pretending to be a woman."" The ad is playing into fears of the Charlotte ordinance enabling predatory behavior on children and women, which could still happen (and still be a crime) without a transgender-friendly law.  With that, let's get into Trump's comments. Trump on NBC’s Today The ad quotes Trump as saying on April 21, ""People go — they use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate."" The comment is plucked out of context from Trump's interview on Today. He was describing transgender people using the bathroom of their choice in Charlotte, N.C., before the state passed HB 2, which prevented local governments from setting anti-discrimination policies and restricted bathroom access to a person's gender on his or her birth certificate. Willie Geist: ""Mr. Trump, please be specific. Tell us your views on LGBT, how you plan to be inclusive as president. Speak about the North Carolina bathroom law, in particular."" Trump: ""Oh, I had a feeling that question was going to come up, I will tell you. Well North Carolina did something. It was very strong. And they're paying a big price. And there's a lot of problems. And I heard — one of the best answers I heard was from a commentator yesterday saying, leave it the way it is, right now. ""There have been not — very few problems. Leave it the way it is. North Carolina, what they're going through with all the business that's leaving and all of the strife — and that's on both sides. You leave it the way it is. There have been very few complaints the way it is. ""People go  — they use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate. There has been so little trouble. And the problem with what happened in North Carolina is the strife and the economic — I mean, the economic punishment that they're taking. So I would say that's probably the best way…"" Matt Lauer: ""So if Caitlyn Jenner were to walk into Trump Tower and wanted to use the bathroom, you would be fine with her using any bathroom she chooses?"" Trump: ""That is correct. ...There's a big move to create new bathrooms. Problem with that is … first of all, I think that would be discriminatory in a certain way. It would be unbelievably expensive for businesses and for the country. Leave it the way it is."" Trump essentially made an economic argument, that North Carolina was hurting financially from its bathroom bill and it should have left the Charlotte issue alone. His comments spurred outraged criticism from social conservatives and reluctant praise from his usual foes like columnist David Brooks and Vox.   But they weren’t his final words on the topic. Later on Fox News’ Hannity Trump gave a different and rather vague answer on Fox News that night. On Sean Hannity’s show, Trump said he believes that bathroom access should be a matter of local control. Hannity: ""I wanted to give you a chance to explain your position on that as it relates to transgenders picking which bathroom they want to go to. I can't even believe I'm asking the question, but I'm asking."" Trump: ""Well, it is a small number, but we have to take care of everybody, frankly. And North Carolina, which is a great place — which I won, by the way — I love North Carolina — and they have a law and it's a law that, you know, unfortunately, is causing them some problems. And I fully understand that they want to go through, but they are losing business and they are having a lot of people come out against. ""With me, I look at it differently. A community, whether it's North Carolina or local communities, really — they should be involved. We have so many big issues to be thinking about, Sean. We have ISIS to worry about. We have bringing trade back. We have rebuilding our military. ""But I think this. I think that local communities and states should make the decision, and I feel very strongly about that. The federal government should not be involved."" Hannity: ""In other words, let the states decide, let local community decides, kind of like your position on education, give it back to the states."" Trump: ""Yes, let them decide. Absolutely."" Here, Trump says the federal government shouldn’t be involved in bathroom policies as it has bigger fish to fry. Instead, he said, it’s up to ""local communities and states."" In the case of North Carolina, the local community of Charlotte enacted a policy, and state lawmakers blocked it from taking effect and prevented other communities from doing the same. So Trump essentially avoided answering the question at the heart of the controversy: whether bathroom policy should be decided by the local community of Charlotte or the state. A few days later on Fox News Sunday Trump advisor Paul Manafort reiterated the billionaire’s local control stance on Fox News a few days later, but he argued that it wasn’t a new position from what Trump said on Today. Host Chris Wallace challenged Manafort’s denial of a reversal. Wallace: ""Wait. Wait. Wait. But 12 hours before or eight hours before, he said leave it the way it is and that there doesn't need to be any change. It's a problem in search of a solution. Manafort: ""Which it is."" Wallace: ""Let me rephrase, it's a solution in search of a problem, that there's not really a problem there."" Manafort: ""What he said, he was asked a question of his personal opinion in the afternoon and then he was asked, ‘How do you handle the issue?’ And he answered that in the evening."" Wallace: ""His personal opinion stands?"" Manafort: ""What stands is what he said when he was asked the specific question of what should happen to this issue and he said it's a state's rights issue, it should be handled by the states."" Our ruling A Cruz ad said Trump thinks ""a grown man pretending to be a woman (should) be allowed to use the women's restroom.""  There's a grain of truth in this claim, but the overall message is highly distorted to scare voters. Trump did say he'd be fine with letting Caitlyn Jenner, a transgender women, use the bathroom of her choice in Trump Tower rather than the bathroom that corresponds to the sex on Jenner's birth certificate. But Trump did not say he supports a man ""pretending to be a woman"" using a woman's restroom.  Trump talked about how bathroom laws that allow people to use the bathroom of their choice are not a problem and bemoaned the business backlash that hit North Carolina with a state law that said people have to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender at birth. The state would have been better off leaving it alone, he argued, but as president he would not want the federal government to be involved.

"The Human Rights Campaign is ""more powerful than the NRA.""","When one thinks of the country’s most powerful lobbying groups, acronyms like NRA, AIPAC and AARP spring to mind. So do phrases like Big Pharma, Big Oil and Wall Street. During an appearance April 17 on NBC’s ""Meet The Press,"" North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory made the argument that the Human Rights Campaign is also among the most powerful lobbies in the United States. ""The Human Rights Council, my gosh, they’re more powerful than the NRA,"" McCrory said, meaning the Human Rights Campaign and the National Rifle Association. The Human Rights Campaign, or HRC, is a major player in the opposition to North Carolina’s controversial new law, House Bill 2, which limits LGBT rights in public accommodations — and which McCrory was on national television to defend. ""They are putting on a lot of pressure instead of having good dialogue,"" McCrory said. The HRC is the country’s largest gay rights group. It has led the charge for gay marriage and for the types of LGBT discrimination protections that HB2 prohibited cities in North Carolina from making. But has the group really eclipsed the NRA, an oft-cited stereotype of a powerful lobbying group that can shape public policy and opinion? McCrory says it has. And in the last few days, that claim has been picked up as a talking point by supporters of HB2. Measuring political power It would be big news if McCrory was right. Debates over gay rights, as with gun rights, are a large part of modern political discourse. We don’t know what criteria McCrory was using, if any, to make his claim. ""Meet The Press"" host Chuck Todd didn’t ask him to elaborate. When we asked McCrory’s campaign about his rationale, spokesman Ricky Diaz called it a ""ridiculous question"" and declined to answer. We also asked both the HRC and the NRA whether they agreed with McCrory. The NRA did not respond, and the HRC declined to answer. There are many ways to measure a group’s strength. We asked an expert, UNC-Chapel Hill political science professor Frank Baumgartner, who has written multiple books on special interest groups and lobbying. He listed three main ways to measure influence: Money and resources, ""cultural resonance"" and record of success or failure. Baumgartner said he believes McCrory’s comparison is ""false or substantially exaggerated."" But let’s look into the numbers to see if they back that up. Money Money is especially important in modern politics because of the Citizens United ruling that McCrory mentioned, which allows for unlimited political spending. In 2014, according to federal tax filings, the NRA and its foundation had revenue of $356.1 million, compared with $51.2 million for the HRC and its foundation. Money allows interest groups to hire lobbyists, contribute directly to politicians and political groups or take part in what’s known as outside spending – TV ads, mailers and other political initiatives. In the 2014 election cycle, according to the Center For Responsive Politics, the NRA’s political spending was 7.5 times greater than the HRC’s ($36.8 million to $4.8 million). In the 2012 cycle, the NRA spent five times as much ($26.9 million to $5.1 million). In both cycles, the NRA spent more on lobbying than the HRC spent on lobbying, contributions and outside spending combined. For outside spending in particular, the NRA spent about $350 for every $1 the HRC spent. ""Cultural resonance"" How do you measure this? It sounds intangible, but there are ways to break it into specific, quantifiable pieces. And in everything we looked at, the NRA came out on top. Membership, magazine subscriptions, Google searches, social media following and official government mentions all show the NRA’s presence is anywhere from 2 to 10 times larger than the HRC’s. Both groups have magazines. The HRC’s goes to more than 350,000 homes, according to a group spokesman this week. According to the publishing group Alliance for Audited Media, the NRA’s three magazines had a combined circulation in 2015 of more than 3.5 million. As for membership, both have been accused in the past of inflating their numbers. Take it with a grain of salt, but the NRA claims 4.5 million members compared with 1.5 million for the HRC. The NRA also has a larger audience on social media – 4.8 million Facebook likes and 345,000 Twitter followers, compared with 2.3 million Facebook likes and 529,000 Twitter followers for the HRC. We also compared online searches, which indicate how interested people are in learning about the groups. When their Google searches over the last 12 years are graphed against each other, the HRC’s results show up as an almost flat line hovering just above 0. We used Google Trends to aggregate numerous terms related to both groups and map their relative popularity as compared with all other searches each month. The NRA is in red and the HRC is in blue. Even the HRC’s best month didn’t surpass the NRA’s worst month.  We also counted how often they’re mentioned in congressional hearing transcripts and other documents listed by the U.S. Government Publishing Office search engine –1,408 results for ""National Rifle Association"" and 393 for ""Human Rights Campaign."" Reputation and success Baumgartner said he thinks this was the point McCrory was trying to make – on a group’s ""ability to push public policy in a direction the group prefers."" And again, Baumgartner said, the HRC doesn’t quite stack up. ""I'd say Human Rights Campaign has had some success,"" he said. ""But no, they would not compare to the long-run success of groups such as the NRA, the Realtors, the petroleum industry, the Chamber of Commerce and many others."" The NRA is famous for its clout and success in Congress. The HRC, on the other hand, has achieved most of its biggest victories – gay marriage, gay adoption rights and the invalidation of anti-sodomy laws – at the Supreme Court. The HRC has existed since 1980. For most of that time, one of its top priorities has been a federal LGBT anti-discrimination law. Efforts to pass such laws state-by-state have been mostly unsuccessful, as we explored in a previous fact check. On the national level, friendly legislators have introduced the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, ENDA, in nearly every Congress since 1994. It has failed each time, despite polling that shows about three quarters of Americans support such laws. The NRA has done the opposite, persuading Congress to repeatedly kill legislation that has even broader public support than ENDA does. Even though about 90 percent of Americans support background checks on gun buyers – previous PolitiFact rulings have found a range of 85 to 93 percent – the federal Fix Gun Checks Act has been voted down several times since 2011. It would allow for universal background checks, and the NRA is strongly opposed to it. As for the HRC, it hasn’t been totally unsuccessful in Congress. The group successfully pushed for a 2009 law that expanded federal hate crime definitions to include LGBT status. And what about outside of government, in the corporate world? It’s undeniable that the HRC’s influence there is growing. The group started ranking how ""LGBT friendly"" companies were in 2002 in what it calls its Corporate Equality Index. About a dozen received a perfect score that year. In 2016, more than 400 companies did. And many businesses have followed the HRC in criticizing North Carolina over HB2. But that hasn’t meant much so far. Key legislators have said they have no plans to repeal HB2 or make major changes to it, despite the pressure. On the other hand, the NRA has seen many of its initiatives passed in North Carolina, like 2013 law that loosened restrictions on concealed carry. Our ruling McCrory said the main group against HB2, the Human Rights Campaign, is ""more powerful than the NRA."" It’s a strong claim, given the NRA’s reputation for power and influence, and even the HRC spokesman was unwilling to embrace it. That’s not to say the HRC isn’t powerful. It’s a multimillion-dollar organization and the country’s largest gay rights group. But it doesn’t have the resources, adherents or success rate that the NRA does. In every way we tried to define influence, the HRC doesn’t even come close to the NRA’s level of power",False,"April 21, 2016"
"""The city of Charlotte passed a bathroom ordinance mandate on every private-sector employer in Charlotte.""","North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory defended a law striking down a local LGBT anti-discrimination ordinance as a move against government intrusion Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press.   The city council of Charlotte, N.C., passed the ordinance in late February outlawing discrimination against gay, lesbian and transgender people in the city. Even though the protections were wide-ranging, the law has been dubbed the ""bathroom ordinance"" because it prohibited businesses from denying transgender people access to the bathroom consistent with the gender they identify with. In response, the North Carolina Legislature held an emergency session a month later and quickly sent a bill repealing the Charlotte ordinance — and prohibiting ones like it — to McCrory’s desk. McCrory’s signature prompted a national backlash from the gay community, businesses such as PayPal and celebrities including Bruce Springsteen. From the beginning, McCrory has characterized the now-defunct ordinance as extreme government overreach in statements, videos and most recently his national interview with NBC host Chuck Todd. ""The city of Charlotte passed a bathroom ordinance mandate on every private-sector employer in Charlotte, N.C,"" McCrory said April 17. ""It's not government's business to tell the private sector what their bathroom, locker room, or shower practices should be. Not only the private business, but also the Y.M.C.A. and other non-profit organizations."" When Todd pressed McCrory to explain the lack of dialogue ahead of the Legislature’s one-day special session to pass the law, he returned to his talking point: ""But again, I don't think government should be telling the private sector what their restroom and shower law should be, to allow a man into a woman's restroom, or a shower facility at a YMCA, for example."" Is it true that the Charlotte ordinance would have dictated the bathroom practices of the entire private sector? ""The Charlotte ordinance was clearly a mandate on every private business open to the public,"" Josh Ellis, McCrory’s communications director, told PolitiFact. Unlike his spokesman, McCrory didn’t specify that the ""mandate"" applies to businesses ""open to the public."" The distinction is important for this fact-check. Broadly speaking, the Charlotte ordinance expanded existing protections for race, color, religion and national origin to also cover marital and familial status, sexual orientation, and gender identity and expression. The ordinance also struck down a section exempting the YMCA, YWCA and similar dormitories from a law ensuring equal access to services and facilities based on sex. Under the ordinance, it would have been illegal: 1. for the government of Charlotte to do business with anyone who had discriminated against those categories; 2. to deny ""the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of a place of public accommodation"" based on those categories; 3. and to make and circulate any statements or signs indicating that public accommodation will be refused based on those categories. Key to this fact-check are the words ""place of public accommodation,"" which refers to any business offering services or goods to the public, per Charlotte’s municipal code. The definition is broad, but not as all-encompassing as McCrory makes it sound. It would have been illegal for places such as stores, hospitals, movie theaters, restaurants and hotels to prohibit transgender customers from using the bathroom or locker room with the gender he or she identifies with, according to a factsheet forwarded to us by city attorney Bob Hagemann. Hagemann also noted that the ordinance only protected customers, not employees. (The ordinance did not include protections for firing or hiring based on sexual orientation or gender identity.) In other words, the ordinance wouldn’t have really impacted businesses that don’t typically deal with customers or patrons in person, such as call centers, manufacturing plants, distribution centers and self-employed workers without office space.  What’s more, the ordinance would have specifically exempted establishments closed to the public like private clubs, advocacy and religious organizations with strongly held beliefs like churches or charities, and nonprofits like homeless shelters, according to the factssheet.  So what about the YMCA? Hagemann wasn’t sure if the YMCA, as a Christian charity, would have been exempted under the ordinance. ""I don’t know enough about how they operate to know whether they would fall under one or more of the exceptions,"" Hagemann said. Ellis, McCrory's spokesperson, told PolitiFact the governor's office disagrees with Hagemann's interpretation of the ordinance. ""The definition does not specifically exclude 'charities' or 'nonprofits.'  In fact, the YMCA makes entertainment and recreation (and probably other services) available to the public, which would put it under the definition of a place of public accommodation,"" Ellis said. ""Bottom line, we see the ordinance as applying to the YMCA.""  The YMCA of Charlotte did not respond immediately to calls or an email for comment. The YWCA of Central Carolinas, meanwhile, currently has a policy of allowing members to use the ""the bathroom/locker room that is appropriate for them based on their gender identity"" and supports the repeal of HB2. Our ruling McCrory said, ""The city of Charlotte passed a bathroom ordinance mandate on every private-sector employer in Charlotte."" This is an exaggeration. The ordinance would have applied to place of public accommodation, like hotels and stores and other places selling goods and services to the public. While that is a big category, the ordinance would not have applied to private clubs, nonprofits or organizations with viewpoints that would have been at odds with the law, nor would have it really impacted business that don't deal with customers.  The talking point contains an element of truth but exaggerates the scope of the law",Mostly False,"April 17, 2016"
"""There are 31 other states and 10,000 other cities that have the same type of policies that we just passed,"" referring to North Carolina’s House Bill 2.","Rep. Paul ""Skip"" Stam, one of North Carolina’s most powerful Republican legislators, gave an interview Monday addressing the jobs and tourism dollars that North Carolina has lost in the wake of the new state law known as House Bill 2, or HB2. PayPal pulled a planned 400-job expansion in Charlotte, and Wake County tourism officials said the law had already cost the county $732,000 with another $24 million in question due to businesses and conventions expressing concern. Stam said the backlash against North Carolina is hard to understand because most states have similar laws. The next day, Deutsche Bank announced it was freezing plans to bring 250 jobs to Cary. ""If they’re not going to go here, there are 31 other states and 10,000 other cities that have the same type of policies that we just passed,"" Stam said, as The News & Observer quoted him on Monday. Is that right? Our first challenge was figuring out exactly what Stam meant when he said ""policies that we just passed,"" because HB2 covers a lot of ground. Here’s a brief rundown of what’s in the bill: Transgender people may not use the bathroom that matches their gender identity in schools or other public buildings – only the gender that’s on their birth certificates. Private businesses may set their own bathroom rules. Cities and counties may not enact local policies concerning discrimination or minimum wages that apply to private businesses. Whether they can enact stronger discrimination policies for their own employees is still unclear, as we explored in another fact check. The anti-discrimination policy for employment does not include sexual orientation or gender identity, which means businesses may discriminate against gay or transgender employees. The anti-discrimination policy for service in public accommodations also does not include protections for sexual orientation or gender identity. People fired for any discriminatory reason – including race, religion, disability and biological sex – no longer may file a lawsuit in state courts. People denied service for any discriminatory reason – including race, religion, disability and biological sex – no longer may sue in state courts. Stam can’t be totally correct when he says the law is the same as in 31 other states because some of these new policies are rare. Only North Carolina and Mississippi, for instance, do not allow discrimination claims to be filed in state court. And North Carolina is one of only a handful of states that have considered so-called bathroom bills to dictate that people can use only the bathroom of the gender on their birth certificates. And it’s that issue, in which North Carolina stands alone for now, that has received the most attention nationally. A similar proposal was shot down in South Dakota, but several other states are considering bathroom bills. Those include Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, Missouri, South Carolina and Tennessee, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality, which tracks such bills nationwide. We double-checked all those state’s bills and found they’re still active; some states are considering multiple bills on the topic. But we digress. Even if Stam isn’t right on some parts of the bill, is he right on any of it? 31 states, 10,000 cities An aide told us Stam was referring only to the lack of discrimination protections for both sexual orientation and gender identity. The District of Columbia and another 20 states do offer such protections; therefore 30 states do not give discrimination protections for both categories. Stam said ""31 other states,"" and really it’s 29 others, but that difference is small. Part of the problem is that Stam was citing an outdated map from the pro-HB2 group Keep NC Safe. The map lists New York as only protecting sexual orientation, but the state added gender identity to its list of protections in January. As of now, two states protect sexual orientation but not gender identity (New Hampshire and Wisconsin), and 28 states protect neither category. Most of those are in the South and Midwest. Stam is right that about 10,000 cities also don't give discrimination protections to gay or lesbian people. An aide told us it was actually just a conservative guess Stam made. We counted and found the guess was on target – it’s safe to say the 30 states in question contain more than 10,000 incorporated places. Because of state-by-state discrepancies in defining places, we counted all incorporated places instead of just cities. Some states divide places into townships, towns, boroughs, villages or cities. Other states call everything a city, even if that city has only four residents — like Ruso, N.D. Some states – looking at you, Michigan – have wildly confusing systems of local governments with overlapping boundaries and differing powers that make it difficult to determine an accurate count. But while we couldn’t find an exact number, we were able to confirm more than 10,000 incorporated places in those states Stam referred to. North Carolina alone has 552. It's worth noting that more than 200 places or counties nationwide have passed anti-discrimination laws that are stricter than their state laws. Still, Stam’s ""10,000 cities"" estimate remains accurate. Our ruling Stam said there are dozens of states and thousands of cities that businesses should also avoid if they truly oppose North Carolina’s new law. That’s overly broad, since the law does many different things. In some cases, North Carolina is one of two states or the only state with policies that HB2 brought into law. But Stam clarified that he was talking specifically about discrimination protections for gay and transgender people. On that, his claim of ""31 other states and 10,000 other cities"" is basically true. Technically there are 29 other states, not 31. That doesn’t really detract from the point he was trying to make – but the fact that he glossed over other parts of the bill does",Half True,"April 13, 2016"
"Charlotte’s anti-discrimination ordinance would have ""opened all bathrooms to all sexes at all times"" if it hadn’t been overturned.","Conservative North Carolina lawmakers called a special legislative session in late March to overturn an LGBT anti-discrimination ordinance in Charlotte that would’ve gone into effect April 1. They ended up adding a lot more to the bill. But the original motivation was to prevent Charlotte, or any other local government, from allowing transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender they identify with in public accommodations – such places as government facilities, hotels, restaurants and movie theaters. That and some of the bill’s other provisions have led to national criticism, from late-night talk show jokes to a canceled Bruce Springsteen concert and the loss of 400 jobs in Charlotte after PayPal pulled out in protest. Republicans have shot back, saying the bill was a common sense solution to safety and privacy concerns. Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, a key supporter of the new law, commonly known as HB2, went a bit further than most. He tweeted a picture from PayPal’s website that showed a bathroom door in the background, with a sign designating the room for men. ""This would be illegal under (the) Charlotte ordinance,"" Forest tweeted. He then doubled down, posting a screenshot of part of Charlotte’s now-defunct ordinance. ""Charlotte ordinance opened all bathrooms to all sexes at all times when it removed exception for bath & locker rooms,"" Forest tweeted. It sounds odd. Charlotte officials say it’s completely untrue. Forest and his team, though, are sticking by their claims. Who is right? The answer isn’t relevant to Charlotte bathroom users anymore because the ordinance has been shot down, but it is relevant to the ongoing political fight over why Republicans felt compelled to overturn the ordinance. Private bathrooms First, let’s take a look at the claim that PayPal’s own gender-specific bathroom sign ""would be illegal"" in Charlotte if the city’s ordinance had been allowed to stand. It wouldn’t. Charlotte’s anti-discrimination ordinance specifically said that ""this section does not apply to a private club or other establishment not, in fact, open to the public."" A PayPal corporate office is a private establishment. So no, it would not have been illegal for PayPal to have male and female restrooms in its own offices. By the same logic, Forest's statement that ""(the) Charlotte ordinance opened all bathrooms to all sexes at all times"" is demonstrably false. The anti-discrimination law would have applied only to public accommodations. Those include places like government buildings, restaurants and hotels. Specifically, Charlotte’s proposed ordinance said the ""full and equal enjoyment"" of such places must not ""be refused, withheld from, or denied any person because of race, color, religion, sex, marital status, familial status, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or national origin."" Previously, that ordinance only included race, color, religion and national origin. The city had also banned sex-based discrimination, but in a separate section that specifically exempted bathrooms and other such facilities. That section was stricken in the new ordinance, which Forest also cited in favor of his argument. Public bathrooms Forest was wrong about private bathrooms, but what about public bathrooms? Would the Charlotte law have opened them to ""all genders at all times?"" Here, the question gets a little more complex since Charlotte did eliminate the existing ordinance that had singled out bathrooms and locker rooms for exemptions. In February, Rep. Dan Bishop – the Mecklenburg County Republican who ultimately sponsored HB2 – sent out an email with claims similar to the ones Forest is making now. City officials replied in a memo that such claims were ""incorrect"" and ""counter to common sense."" City Attorney Robert Hagemann said the right to have separate bathrooms is implied in society and doesn’t need a local ordinance to confirm it. He added that no other city or state with similar anti-discrimination rules has argued that anyone could go into any bathroom, and that Charlotte officials never wanted to argue that, either. Forest’s press secretary Jamey Falkenbury said the argument for an implied right might be true for some places, but Charlotte would’ve been different because it specifically removed that right from its laws. ""When a legislative body removes an exception, they are indicating to the courts they do not want the former exception implied,"" he said. ""Hypothetically, if a man who identifies as a man in Charlotte was tried for trespassing for being in a women's bathroom, you better believe that any criminal defense attorney worth their salt would raise this as a defense."" But Hagemann said there would be wide-reaching consequences if Forest, Bishop and others were right that an all-inclusive protection for sex-based discrimination meant all bathrooms were opened to everyone. ""I understand that a similar argument was used by Phyllis Schlafly and other opponents of the Equal Rights Amendment back in the late 1970s,"" he wrote in an email. ""... And if their reasoning is correct, every employer covered by Title VII, including the State of North Carolina, could not provide separate restrooms for their employees since Title VII prohibits discrimination based on sex in the workplace."" Our ruling Forest, a vocal opponent of Charlotte’s anti-discrimination ordinance, said it would have ""opened all bathrooms to all sexes at all times."" That is wrong. The ordinance would not have applied to private clubs or businesses – including PayPal, despite Forest’s claims to the contrary. The ordinance would have applied only to public accommodations. And while there’s disagreement on what might have happened with bathrooms in public accommodations, precedent is on Charlotte’s side",False,"April 8, 2016"
"""Attorney General Roy Cooper refuses to do his job"" by not defending House Bill 2 in a lawsuit.","N.C. Attorney General Roy Cooper took flak from many conservatives when he announced that he would not defend a controversial new state law, commonly called HB2, in court. The law says only biological gender, and not gender identity, can determine which bathroom someone may use. It also created a statewide anti-discrimination law that doesn’t include protections for gay or transgender people. The ACLU, Equality NC and several transgender or gay people who say it discriminates against them have filed a lawsuit. Cooper is named as a defendant, as are Gov. Pat McCrory, the UNC System, its board of governors and the board of governors chairman, W. Louis Bissette Jr. Republicans, including Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger, have accused Cooper of playing politics by telling the legislature to repeal the law or hire outside counsel to defend it. Cooper is the Democratic candidate for governor in this fall’s election. ""Attorney General Roy Cooper refuses to do his job and defend us,"" Berger wrote in a Facebook post. ""This isn't the first time Cooper has pandered to far-left special interests instead of fulfilling his oath to defend the people of North Carolina. Please join me and call on Roy Cooper to resign immediately, for refusing to do his job and protect our children."" We already looked at claims in the HB2 debate about safety and protecting people from sex crimes. Chris Sgro of Equality NC said sexual predators have not used transgender anti-discrimination laws as cover to sneak into women’s bathrooms and commit crimes. We rated that claim Mostly True. But what about the crux of Berger’s call for Cooper to resign? Is the attorney general refusing to do his job here? ""It’s clear I’m doing my job in this case,"" Cooper told a reporter at the news conference when he announced his decision in late March. Clearly Cooper and Berger disagree on the responsibilities of the attorney general. But that’s understandable – it’s a question that has kept legal scholars busy for years. First, let’s look at what state law says. Duties of the job The N.C. Attorney General has no constitutional duties. The office’s duties have instead been pieced together over the years by common law, court rulings and state statutes. The main source is General Statute chapter 114, which lays out eight duties of the office. One is to represent the state ""in any cause or matter, civil or criminal, in which the state may be a party or interested."" The N.C. Supreme Court reaffirmed that duty in a 1987 case. And just a few years ago, Cooper cited this duty in explaining why he would defend the state’s voter ID law despite his own opinion about it. ""It is the duty under the law for this office to defend the state when it gets sued — even if I personally disagree with the public policy,"" Cooper said in a 2013 Los Angeles Times interview. ""This office is going to follow the law."" That appears at first to contradict what Cooper is saying now. The HB2 case, however, is different in two key ways. Cooper simply said he disagreed with the voter ID law. But he is calling HB2 unconstitutional. Furthermore, two state agencies – including his own – are challenging the law. Cooper has said he will represent them instead. That brings into consideration another duty of the job, to represent state ""departments, agencies, institutions, commissions, bureaus or other organized activities"" in legal issues. Legal precedent So what happens when a legal battle involves state government on both sides, as with HB2? This isn’t the first time it has happened under Cooper. In 2014, McCrory sued the General Assembly, saying it acted unconstitutionally in appointing members of an environmental committee. Cooper defended the legislature. McCrory hired private lawyers and recently won at the N.C. Supreme Court. This time, however, Cooper says he won’t defend the state, since his own office and the N.C. Treasurer’s office are calling the law unconstitutional. ""This case presents the attorney general with a direct conflict – whether to argue the constitutionality of these executive branch policies and the rights of these employees or the constitutionality of HB2,"" said Cooper’s deputy campaign manager, Megan Jacobs. Scholarly opinions Berger’s office strongly disagrees with the argument that HB2 is unconstitutional, however. ""Lawyers will always claim gray areas and make legalistic excuses,"" said Amy Auth, Berger’s deputy chief of staff. She said defending the state is foremost among Cooper’s duties and called his argument ""a make-believe legal conflict to prop up his refusal to defend state law."" However, constitutional law professor Gregory Wallace of Campbell University School of Law said the issue is more nuanced. State law doesn’t give any exceptions to the office’s duties, Wallace said, ""but many scholars and attorneys have recognized certain implicit exceptions to the duty to defend at both the federal and state level­."" Wallace said Cooper could be impeached for acting outside the scope of his duties, but also that his oath to uphold the constitution would arguably give him a valid excuse not to defend a law that he believes is unconstitutional. These types of questions are fairly new, and ambiguous. Last year the Yale Law Journal published a study whose title shows the complexity of the issue: ""Fifty States, Fifty Attorneys General, and Fifty Approaches to the Duty To Defend."" It found that these types of squabbles were almost unheard of before 2008 but have increased significantly since then. It argued that attorneys general can choose not to defend some laws. ""With Democrats and Republicans squarely divided on issues like same-sex marriage, gun control, and campaign finance, we predict that attorneys general will increasingly seek political advantage by refusing to defend (or insisting on the defense of) laws that divide the parties,"" the law professors behind the article wrote. In 2009 the National Association of Attorneys General asked Jim Tierney – a law professor, former Maine attorney general and expert on the office – to lead a discussion about whether attorneys general should defend the constitutionality of laws and actions they believe to be unconstitutional. ""Basically, when is it okay for an attorney general to lie to the public?"" Tierney asked the crowd at the meeting. He later answered his own question: ""The courts generally support broad discretion for attorneys general … stating that the real client of the attorney general is the people of the state."" Nearly 30 years ago, former N.C. Attorney General Lacy Thornburg made a similar argument in a law review article, writing that the office's chief duty is to the people, not the government. Wallace, the constitutional law professor, said he thinks an attorney general must believe in good faith that a law is unconstitutional in order not to defend it. ""By a ‘good faith’ belief in the law’s unconstitutionality, I do not mean mere disagreement with the law because it’s bad policy in the AG’s view or because recusing would give the AG a political advantage in an upcoming political campaign,"" Wallace said. Our ruling Berger said that by not defending HB2 in court, Cooper ""refuses to do his job"" as attorney general. State law does say Cooper's job includes the duty to to defend the state in court. However, that’s not the end of the debate. Cooper has other possibly conflicting duties. And legal scholars tend to side with Cooper's argument that attorneys general don’t always have to defend laws – especially ones they believe to be unconstitutional. However, the issue is a new one in North Carolina, and the law is still relatively unsettled",Half True,"April 7, 2016"
"North Carolina spent ""almost as much as it spends on government rape crisis programs in a year"" to convene a special session for HB2.","The North Carolina General Assembly convened a special session last week and passed a sweeping bill that prohibits schools from letting transgender students use the bathroom of the gender they identify with. It also prohibits cities and counties from raising the minimum wage or passing local anti-discrimination laws. The bill was supported by every Republican member of the N.C. House and Senate, as well as 11 House Democrats. Some critics cried foul that it took away discrimination protections from the LGBT community. Others, including the liberal think tank Center for American Progress, criticized the GOP for calling a special session at an extra cost to taxpayers. When the legislature is in session it costs the state approximately $42,000 a day, on average. The LGBT Progress branch of the Center for American Progress compared that figure unfavorably to state spending that helps rape victims. A few minutes after the bill passed, the group tweeted: ""NC spent $42K today to ban trans ppl from bathrooms. That’s almost as much as it spends on government rape crisis programs in a year."" The tweet’s premise itself is slightly misleading, perhaps due to the forced brevity in Twitter’s 140-character limit. North Carolina did not ban transgender people from bathrooms. It banned them from the bathroom of the gender they identify as. They may still use whichever bathroom corresponds with the gender on their birth certificate. But let’s look at the second part of the tweet. Did North Carolina really just spend nearly as much meeting to overturn the Charlotte ordinance – citing fears over sexual assault as a major motivation – as it spends in a year to help victims of rape? Yes and no. The state spends about $45,000 a year on government-run rape crisis program. That’s close to the $42,000 estimated price tag for the special session. But the state also spends another $2.8 million annually on funds that get distributed to the charities that run the vast majority of rape crisis centers throughout the state. But the tweet did specify government rape crisis programs. Sarah McBride, the campaigns and communications manager for the think tank’s LGBT branch, said it was carefully worded that way. ""The government rape crisis program appropriations was $44,678 in the NC certified 2015-2016 budget and the same in the 2016-2017 budget,"" she wrote in an email, providing a budget document as proof. ""Note that the spending for NGO rape crisis programs is much higher, but that the tweet specified ""government programs."" NGO means non-government-organization – in this case, charities like the North Carolina Coalition Against Sexual Assault, which maintains more than 100 rape crisis centers and emergency hotlines for victims all over the state. In addition to donations, these NGOs also rely on some government funding. In recent years, that support has equated to $2.8 million – in addition to the nearly $45,000 that the state spends on government-run rape crisis initiatives. We appreciate McBride’s transparency. But the average person reading that tweet isn’t going to be familiar with the government-versus-NGO breakdown of rape services in North Carolina, which makes it fairly misleading. In fact, even a spokesman for the N.C. Department of Administration – the agency that distributes the state’s $2.8 million rape crisis budget – said he had no idea what the tweet was referring to. Our ruling LGBT Progress said North Carolina spent ""almost as much as it spends on government rape crisis programs in a year"" to convene a special session for HB2. While that’s technically not wrong, due to careful wording, it’s highly misleading. The vast majority of government spending to help aid victims goes to local charities, not government rape crisis programs, which is less than 2 percent of annual spending on assistance to rape victims",Mostly False,"April 1, 2016"
"""There have not been any public safety issues"" in cities that allow transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender they identify as.","In the fight to defend Charlotte’s anti-discrimination ordinance, supporters questioned claims that it would have been a threat to public safety. Chris Sgro, executive director of Equality NC, said many large cities have rules similar to what Charlotte proposed, before the legislature nullified it. Equality NC has since sued North Carolina to try to overturn the law. ""There have not been any public safety issues in those other communities,"" Sgro said at a rally outside the legislature just days before Charlotte’s bill was overturned. Conservatives weren’t swayed, though. Before Charlotte’s bill was passed, and then after when it was being debated by the General Assembly and even now that is has been overturned, concerns about safety have been frequently mentioned. Mostly, opponents said opening up women’s restrooms to transgender women – people who are biologically male but identify as female – will make it easier for male sexual predators to commit crimes in bathrooms and locker rooms. Online, supporters galvanized around the motto #KeepNCSafe and sent out ads that included the phrase ""don’t let our girls become victims"" and ""keep children safe."" N.C. GOP Executive Director Dallas Woodhouse cited ""privacy and safety concerns"" in attacking Attorney General Roy Cooper, who is running for governor as a Democrat, for not stepping in to stop Charlotte’s bill on his own. A popular Christian author from Charlotte, Frank Turek, wrote an article about the backlash to the law that included the line, ""The danger is real from sexual predators in women’s restrooms."" On Thursday, the N.C. GOP distributed his column via email and bolded that sentence about sexual predators. So who is right? The evidence is overwhelmingly on Sgro’s side. That’s not to say that people don’t have honest concerns over privacy or mental anguish. Indeed, several opponents of Charlotte’s ordinance have spoken of their own experiences with sexual assault, and their fears that seeing someone with male genitalia in a women’s room might trigger painful memories. But still, Sgro said, Charlotte’s bill would not have legalized sexual assault, harassment or voyeurism – it just would’ve let transgender men and women use the bathrooms they’re more comfortable in. ""Transgender people are not predators,"" he said. Examples to prove Sgro wrong? The entire state of Maryland and some of the largest cities in the country, including New York City, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Seattle and Austin, Texas, have rules banning discrimination against transgender people in public accommodation, including bathrooms. More than 200 cities and counties also ban workplace discrimination against transgender people. A dozen state public school systems and dozens of college campuses also have ordinances banning discrimination against transgender people, including in bathrooms. We asked the N.C. GOP if they could point to anything that backs up the safety fears. They provided a link to a news story in Seattle from earlier this year, about a man who had twice gone into a women’s locker room and began undressing. Seattle does allow transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender they identify as. The man didn’t identify as transgender and didn’t appear to present as a woman, the story said. No one called the police, and the man wasn’t charged with any crime. Follow-up stories described the incident as a stunt, perhaps politically motivated. The liberal group Media Matters For America has studied the bathroom issue for several years, largely under the guidance of Carlos Maza. Maza, a Wake Forest University graduate, tweeted after North Carolina’s new law passed that ""A man has never used an LGBT non-discrimination law to sneak into a bathroom."" Maza has also polled public school systems that allow transgender students to use the bathroom of the gender they identify as. In a June 2015 article, he wrote that in 17 districts with a total of 600,00 students, officials hadn’t reported a single incident of ""harassment or inappropriate behavior"" related to transgender students and bathrooms. But we still weren’t satisfied, so we kept digging, looking for examples of proven criminal behavior. We were likewise unable to find any examples in the United States, though we did find a case in Canada. In that case, Christopher Hambrook posed as a woman to gain entry to women’s shelters, where he attacked several people before being caught. Hambrook was sentenced to an ""indefinite"" jail term in 2014 that could lead to him spending the rest of his life in prison. Hambrook committed the crimes in Toronto, which has an ordinance protecting transgender people. That appears to be the first, and so far only, incident of its kind in North America. After spending hours combing through conservative blogs and family values websites dedicated to news about transgender bathroom ordinances, we were able to confirm three cases in the United States in the last 17 years in which a biological male was convicted of a crime that involved him in a women’s bathroom or locker room and dressed as a woman. It’s unclear if any of the three identified as transgender women, but none of those cases happened in cities where it would’ve been legal for a transgender woman to use the women’s room anyway. And none involved sexual assault or rape. In 1999, Patrick Hagan was convicted in Tampa, Fla., for punching a woman in a bar bathroom during an argument. In 2010, Norwood Burns was convicted in Gordon County, Georgia, for exposing himself in a Walmart bathroom. In 2011, Thomas Lee Benson was convicted of trespassing in a Clackamas, Oregon, women’s locker room and trying to talk to children. Again, though, none of those crimes occurred in places where biological men would’ve had any legal claim to being in a women’s room by virtue of being a transgender woman. The blogs did identify a few examples of alleged criminal activity having taken place under the guise of transgender-friendly bathrooms laws, but we couldn’t find proof of any convictions in those cases. Our ruling Chris Sgro, the executive director of Equality NC, said that ""There have not been any public safety issues in those other communities"" with ordinances allowing transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice. We haven’t found any instances of criminals convicted of using transgender protections as cover in the United States. Neither have any left-wing groups or right-wing groups. There was one incident in Canada, involving a rapist. In the U.S., there have been a few yet-unproven allegations",Mostly True,"April 1, 2016"
"Despite the passage of HB2, ""towns, cities and counties in North Carolina are still allowed to set stricter non-discrimination policies for their own employees if they choose.""","In what he dubbed a ""myths vs. facts"" press release addressing news reports on North Carolina’s new LGBT law, Gov. Pat McCrory made multiple statements that caused us to raise our eyebrows. In general McCrory has been trying to downplay the effects of the state’s new law, commonly referred to as HB2. We already checked one of his statements, on the possibility of North Carolina losing $4.5 billion in federal education funding due to Title IX violations. McCrory said there’s no threat, citing a federal judge’s opinion. We rated that claim Half True. We also checked McCrory’s statement that this law didn’t take away ""any rights"" in ""any city in North Carolina."" We rated that claim False. Now we’re turning our attention to a claim of his about the ability of cities to strengthen employment policies. The state now recognizes discrimination only against certain groups, not including gay or transgender people. The new law does allow cities and counties to set in-house rules on minimum wage, work hours and other employment-related issues. They can’t impose any such rules on private businesses, but they can make the rules for themselves. When it comes to discrimination rules, however, the issue is much murkier – even despite the governor’s promise that there’s nothing to worry about. ""Does this law prohibit towns, cities or counties in North Carolina from setting their own nondiscrimination policies in employment that go beyond state law?"" McCrory asked in his press release. ""Answer: No. Town(s), cities and counties in North Carolina are still allowed to set stricter non-discrimination policies for their own employees if they choose."" However, the actual wording of the law seems to say the exact opposite. Let’s hear it: ""... the General Statutes supersede and preempt any ordinance, regulation, resolution, or policy adopted or imposed by a unit of local government or other political subdivision of the State that regulates or imposes any requirement upon an employer pertaining to the regulation of discriminatory practices in employment, except such regulations applicable to personnel employed by that body that are not otherwise in conflict with State law."" The end initially appears to say local governments can protect their own employees (""personnel employed by that body"") from discriminatory firing – a phrase that would appear to back up McCrory’s point. But the sentence doesn’t stop there. It continues on: ""except such regulations applicable to personnel employed by that body that are not otherwise in conflict with State law"" (emphasis added). And the new state law says the only discrimination protections recognized in North Carolina are ""race, religion, color, national origin, age, biological sex or handicap."" It defines biological sex as ""The physical condition of being male or female, which is stated on a person's birth certificate."" In Greensboro, town officials are skeptical that McCrory is correct in saying they’ll be able to keep their old, stricter policies that protected transgender people. A memo from the office of City Attorney Tom Carruthers said ""the recent amendments in city policy and ordinance to protect gender identity and gender preference are now probably eliminated."" Carrboro had similar discrimination protections. Like in Greensboro, town leaders think they may now be moot – particularly the protections for transgender employees – despite what McCrory said. ""The bill calls into question – and I’m being careful with my word choice there – it calls into question the ability of local government to ban discrimination based on gender identity (because) that’s not the same as biological sex,"" Carrboro Town Attorney Nick Herman said. Other town, city or county governments had gender identity discrimination protections that are now in question, including Raleigh, Charlotte, Asheville, Boone and Chapel Hill, and Buncombe, Mecklenberg and Orange counties. According to the News & Observer, Chapel Hill Mayor Pam Hemminger cited the loss of in-house anti-discrimination rules as one reason why the town passed a resolution calling for the law’s repeal. ""The greatest sentiment was the loss of local control,"" Hemminger said. Asking law professors So the law says that cities and counties can have stricter discrimination policies, unless they conflict with state law. Most of the affected cities previously had discrimination rules regarding gay and transgender employees. And yet it appears that any attempt to restore their protections – especially for transgender people – would conflict with state law. Why is that exception even included in the bill, if it appears to nullify itself? ""That is a savings clause that saves nothing,"" said Enrique Armijo, a constitutional law professor at Elon University School of Law. Essentially, Armijo argued, it looks important but means nothing. He said it’s ""farcical"" for McCrory to argue that the law allows local governments to set stricter, internal anti-discrimination policies. ""The governor's interest here is in making the law seem like it does a lot less than it does,"" Armijo said. Unfortunately, we don’t know exactly what legal interpretation McCrory was using when he put together his ""myths vs. facts"" press release, which is on his state website, campaign website and was distributed by numerous state agencies. His office did not respond to multiple requests for help clarifying the reasoning behind his statement, or the seeming contradictions in the law. So we went and talked to more law professors. Katharine T. Bartlett, a former dean of Duke University Law School who is now a professor there, said McCrory’s claim seems true. Bartlett teaches and writes about subjects including employment discrimination, gender and the law, gender theory and social change. ""This ‘except such regulations…’ language is very vague,"" she said. ""Perhaps intentionally so, perhaps a result of the rush in which it was enacted. That said, I would read this language to allow local governments to have their own nondiscriminatory policies, as long as they do not impose them on any other employers."" On the other hand is Michael Gerhardt, the Samuel Ashe Distinguished Professor in constitutional law at UNC-Chapel Hill and the director of the school’s Law and Government program. ""I think (McCrory’s) reading is disingenuous,"" Gerhardt said. ""... It seems like (HB2) was motivated to produce a law that was going to override whatever the localities did."" Our ruling Local government leaders are worried they’ll lose local discrimination protections, and two of the three legal experts we spoke with said they have good reason to be. The consensus isn’t unanimous. Bartlett, the former Duke Law dean, argued that McCrory is correct. And even some of the municipal leaders couched their fears, not willing to say their policies are definitely gone. It might be that no one will know for sure until a judge rules one way or the other. But in the meantime, McCrory is telling local governments that they can absolutely keep doing something that the local governments themselves, and several constitutional law professors, don’t necessarily think they can. But McCrory doesn’t offer any legal reasoning for his claim, his office didn’t respond when asked to clarify the seeming contradictions, and the majority of people we spoke to who are involved in the issue directly, or are looking at it from the outside as professors, believe that it’s not nearly so cut-and-dried",Half True,"March 31, 2016"
"""We have not taken away any rights that have currently existed in any city in North Carolina"" with the passage of HB2.","Ever since North Carolina passed a new state law banning cities and counties from enacting their own ordinances on discrimination laws, minimum wages and more, Republican leaders have been on the defensive in the face of national attention. A major talking point has been that, even despite the new law, nothing has actually changed. Gov. Pat McCrory has said as much in person as well as in written statements. Other GOP leaders who supported the bill have done the same. ""We have not taken away any rights that have currently existed in any city in North Carolina, from Raleigh to Durham to Chapel Hill to Charlotte,"" McCrory said at a press conference Monday. ""Every city and every corporation has the exact same discrimination policy this week as they had two weeks ago."" We’re going to focus specifically on the claim about cities. When asked about it at that press conference Monday, McCrory said he was blindsided by the question and couldn’t answer it. The reporter had asked, specifically, about the status of a housing discrimination ordinance in Greensboro and a policy in Raleigh that said any contractors who wanted to do business with the local government needed to have policies forbidding discrimination against gay or transgender people. Carrboro also has a similar policy for contractors. A spokesman for the governor later said local housing ordinances wouldn’t be affected, citing a part of the bill that exempts ""any private club or other establishment not, in fact, open to the public."" But he had no answers about Carrboro and Raleigh on Monday. He didn’t respond to a follow-up email sent Wednesday. Another spokesman responded only to say he wasn’t the right person to ask. Perhaps that’s because the law does invalidate those ordinances. ""He’s completely wrong about that, unfortunately,"" said Carrboro’s town attorney, Nick Herman, about McCrory’s claim that the law doesn’t take away any existing rights. Herman said the governor’s comments surprised him. Carrboro, for years, has had a policy that contractors paid by the town must have anti-discrimination policies that include sexual orientation or gender identity. And HB2 specifically says that local governments do not have the right to put any such requirements on contractors. ""I was absolutely shocked to hear that the governor – I give him all presumption of good faith – but for him to claim this bill does not change existing law means he is not being adequately advised,"" Herman said. More towns and counties around the state also had in-house anti-discrimination policies that protected local government employees on the basis of sexual orientation and/or gender identity. McCrory has also said those won’t go away, although some of the officials in those municipalities say they’re skeptical. We interviewed three law professors about it; two disagreed with McCrory and one agreed with him. No more state claims for discrimination Taking a broader look at the law, it also took away a right that had previously been available to residents of any and every city in the state – the ability to file a state lawsuit over discriminatory firing. Such claims had been accepted by state courts since the 1980s, but they are no longer valid under HB2. ""This Article does not create, and shall not be construed to create or support, a statutory or common law private right of action, and no person may bring any civil action based upon the public policy expressed herein,"" the law states. ""This is a seismic issue,"" said Eric Doggett, a Raleigh lawyer who works in employment discrimination. ""It’s huge. It’s a massive loss of rights, and it happened with almost no debate."" Laura Noble, a Chapel Hill employment discrimination lawyer, agreed. ""I won’t refer to this as a ‘bathroom bill’ because that's really not what it's about,"" she said. ""It’s about the elimination of discrimination protections."" The law does say people who believe they were fired for discriminatory reasons can still bring suits to the state executive branch’s Human Resource Commission. But Doggett said that group doesn’t have the ability to award damages, like the state courts did until last Wednesday. ""There’s no remedy,"" he said. ""They have no teeth. … If we state it's the public policy of this state not to discriminate on those bases, it doesn’t mean anything if we can't enforce it."" Noble concurred, saying that no matter the state discrimination policy is now, it’s largely meaningless. ""What's the point of having it on the books if there's no sanctions if someone violates it?"" She said. People can still file federal discrimination lawsuits. However, both attorneys said federal courts have a much shorter statute of limitations than state courts – less than six months, compared to three years – which often stops plaintiffs from suing if they have a case but waited too long. Debbie Durban, a corporate attorney with Nelson Mullins who practices in North and South Carolina, has experience defending businesses from discrimination claims. She also said her understanding of the bill is that it takes away state lawsuits, although she said most state claims eventually end up at the federal level anyway. Our ruling McCrory said that with the passage of HB2, ""we have not taken away any rights that have currently existed in any city in North Carolina."" That is not true. It took away the rights of cities to put certain anti-discrimination requirements on private contractors, and it nullified existing policies like in Carrboro and Raleigh. It might have also taken away the rights of cities and counties to pass their own in-house anti-discrimination policies, depending on which lawyer you ask. And it takes away the right of everyone in North Carolina to file a state-level lawsuit alleging a discriminatory firing, according to attorneys who represent both employers and employees in those cases. But even if you discount the discrimination lawsuit changes and only focus on municipal government powers and rights, McCrory is still wrong",False,"March 30, 2016"
"""Will (HB2) threaten federal funding for public schools under Title IX? No, according to a federal court which has looked at a similar issue.""","One of the biggest questions in the ongoing debate over North Carolina’s new statewide law invalidating local LGBT protections is the status of $4.5 billion in federal education funding via Title IX. Title IX is a 1972 law that requires educational institutions to treat men and women equally. It has been used to punish schools for not taking sexual assault seriously, or for not offering women chances to play sports. The federal government has begun arguing in recent years that Title IX protections extend to transgender students, and a 2014 Department of Education memo formalized that position.   ""All students, including transgender students and students who do not conform to sex stereotypes, are protected from sex-based discrimination under Title IX,"" the memo reads. ""Under Title IX, a recipient generally must treat transgender students consistent with their gender identity in all aspects of the planning, implementation, enrollment, operation, and evaluation of single-sex classes."" Transgender people are those who don’t identify with the gender on their birth certificate. Even if they have one gender’s anatomy, they live life as the other gender and consider themselves to truly be that gender. One widely cited study in 2011 estimated that 0.3 percent of adults are transgender. North Carolina’s new law specifically prohibits schools from allowing transgender students to use bathrooms consistent with their gender identity.  The law says schools may only permit a student to use the restrooms, locker rooms or other such facilities of the gender listed on the student’s birth certificate. The ACLU and some Democratic legislators say that contradiction between the state law and the federal guidance could cost billions. North Carolina is scheduled to receive an estimated $4.58 billion from the federal government in 2016 for education funding, which could be at risk with a Title IX violation. Those funds are largely for Pell Grants and student loans but also go toward K-12 programs for homeless students, rural schools, adult literacy and more. Republicans thoroughly disagree that the funding is at risk, and it was one of 18 points Gov. Pat McCrory made in a press release over Easter weekend which he dubbed ""Facts vs. Myths."" ""Will this bill threaten federal funding for public schools under Title IX?"" McCrory asked, only to then answer: ""No, according to a federal court which has looked at a similar issue."" McCrory has a point,  but he leaves out a lot of detail. In eastern Virginia, a federal judge did rule that a school district wasn’t violating Title IX by refusing to let a transgender teen, who was born a female but identifies as male, use the boys bathroom. In that lawsuit, the student was represented by the ACLU and had statements of support from the U.S. Department of Justice and Department of Education. The Virginia case McCrory knows the case well; he was one of two governors (along with Maine Republican Gov. Paul LePage) who submitted briefs on behalf of the school district in that case. A few other states weighed in with briefs from their attorneys general, but North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper – and McCrory’s Democratic opponent in November – declined to follow suit. The Virginia school district restricted students to bathrooms based on their ""biological gender,"" which is similar to the ""biological sex"" wording used in North Carolina now. And in Virginia, the judge said that restriction is OK. So McCrory is right on that much. But he fails to mention that the case is currently under consideration by the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, the federal appeals court which also covers North Carolina. The ACLU has further asked that the 85-year-old judge in question be removed from the case, alleging he didn’t follow proper procedure and made statements indicating he doesn’t have a firm grasp of science. ""Regardless of the outcome of this case, the public in general, and transgender people in particular, should have confidence the proceedings are not based on mistaken assumptions that continue to stigmatize transgender people, even if unintentionally,"" the ACLU wrote in asking the appeals court to remove the judge, Robert G. Doumar. The appeal states the judge refused expert witness testimony, allowed hearsay evidence on behalf of the school district but not on behalf of the student, refused testimony from the student, referred to the student as having a ""mental disorder"" – even after being informed that ""The American Psychiatric Association has made clear that Gender Dysphoria should not be described as a ‘disorder’"" – and went off on a tangent about federal policies concerning drug use, immigration and other unrelated issues. The appeals court heard the appeal in January but has not yet announced its decision. Other cases Last year a judge in Pennsylvania ruled against a transgender University of Pittsburgh student, who was expelled and criminally charged after repeatedly ignoring a bathroom ban. In that case, unlike in the Virginia case happening around the same time, the federal government did not weigh in. And then there’s the matter of other cases in which schools have settled with the federal government rather than going to court, like in the Virginia case. Schools in Illinois and California changed their policies after being threatened with the loss of funding by the federal government via Title IX. In Illinois, a transgender student who was born a male was allowed to change in the girls locker room, but behind a curtain. Previously the student had been using private, single-occupancy rooms to change – a provision that North Carolina’s law does allow for – but the federal authorities told Illinois officials that wasn’t good enough. In California, a school district agreed to let transgender students use the facilities of the gender they identify as, to amend its anti-discrimination policies to include ""gender identity,"" to train administrators on how to accommodate transgender students and to give students ""age-appropriate"" lessons to discourage bullying and sexual harassment of transgender people. Our ruling Gov. Pat McCrory is correct that a federal judge said schools shouldn’t lose Title IX funding for not allowing transgender students to use the bathroom of the gender they identify with. But McCrory failed to mention that the case is still pending on appeal, and that there are questions about the judge’s impartiality. Furthermore, the threat of losing Title IX funds was real enough to convince authorities in Illinois and California to comply. In the end, it largely comes down to politics. The two judges who have ruled against transgender students are Republican political appointees. The federal departments of education and justice, which typically support transgender students, are run by Democratic political appointees. McCrory is right that a judge said there shouldn’t be a threat to Title IX funding in these types of situations. But that’s not to say there’s no threat at all – the official stance of the Obama administration, after all, has been enough of a threat to scare Illinois and California into making changes. Those are important pieces of context that are nowhere to be found in McCrory’s statement",Half True,"March 28, 2016"
"When a Gallup poll asked about presidential candidate characteristics, ""When they get to the question on, 'Would you vote for a socialist,' it is even less popular than voting for atheists.""","Is Democrat Bernie Sanders going to suffer in the polls because he calls himself a socialist? Jennifer Granholm, the former Democratic governor of Michigan and a Hillary Clinton backer, thinks so. During the Jan. 24 edition of ABC's This Week, she said ""the word socialist is a really hard word"" for voters. ""Now, I love Bernie Sanders, really, I appreciate the fact that he's bringing out young people. But when you look at that word ‘socialist,’ the Gallup poll did an analysis of what are the characteristics that people would vote for in a president. 'Would you vote for a Mormon?' 'Would you vote for a Jew?' 'Would you vote for a Catholic?' When they get to the question on would you vote for an atheist, it is -- or, excuse me, a socialist, it is even less popular than voting for atheists,"" Granholm said. ""That is why it's an issue."" Because the polls say that Sanders is giving Clinton a run for her money, we wondered whether calling yourself a socialist really carries the type of stigma that Granholm described. We contacted Granholm's office but didn't hear back. The Gallup poll in question is a survey of 1,527 adults in June 2015. The survey found 47 percent of respondents would vote for a socialist presidential candidate nominated by their party even if the candidate was ""generally well-qualified."" Fifty percent would not. An atheist candidate would be tolerable to only 58 percent, with 40 percent saying they would not vote for any atheist candidate. Here's the list: Willingness to vote for a qualified candidate who is . . .  a Catholic 93% Jewish 91% a Muslim 60% a woman 92% a Mormon 81% an atheist 58% black 92% gay or lesbian 74% a socialist 47% Hispanic 91% an evangelical Christian 73% Survey taken June 2-7, 2015 In a similar vein, a 2010 Fox News survey found that while only 39 percent of Americans would be comfortable with having an atheist on the Supreme Court, support for a socialist was even lower — 31 percent. Yet if Americans have such antipathy to socialists, why is Sanders, a self-declared socialist, doing so well? For one thing, Sanders makes it clear that he's not a socialist in the old Soviet Union sense. He often calls himself a democratic socialist who talks about the type of socialism seen in the Scandinavian countries, where the political system is democratic. His socialism is often in line with what would be considered strong liberal beliefs. PolitiFact explored the issue in detail in August 2015. Scott Clifford, a political scientist as the University of Houston, said it's important to remember that each person surveyed was ""asked not about support for atheists/socialists in general, but in the context of their own party nominating one."" So Democrats will be more open to socialist ideas because the party tends to be liberal, ""home to secular Americans,"" he said. The Republican Party tends to be home to more evangelicals and other religious traditionalists, Clifford said by email, so Republicans would be naturally wary of a nominee who is a socialist. ""After all, a Republican socialist is effectively an oxymoron in modern American politics,"" he said. That was clear when Gallup broke the results into party lines. Willingness to vote for Democrats Republicans Difference An evangelical Christian 66% 84% 18 points An atheist 64% 45% 19 points A gay or lesbian 85% 61% 24 points A Muslim 73% 45% 28 points A socialist 59% 26% 33 points John Geer, a political scientist at Vanderbilt University, said there are a lot of misunderstandings about the term socialist, ""so the survey questions you have in Gallup are probably not very indicative of the amount of support socialists might have."" The term ""socialist"" may lose some of its sting because Sanders offers it as a solution to voters’ concerns, such as income inequality, he said. He is also highlighting the idea that other industrialized countries that have embraced socialism are doing better on matters such as health care, ""and people are giving him high marks for dealing with the (socialist) question directly and not trying to hedge,"" Geer said. Whether Sanders can change the country's aversion to actually voting for a socialist remains to be seen. Our ruling Granholm said a Gallup survey found that the idea of voting for a socialist for president is even less popular than voting for an atheist.

"""The states have always defined marriage.""","Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., doesn’t like the Supreme Court’s ruling legalizing same-sex marriage, but he said he won’t work to overturn it if he becomes president. Instead, Rubio told NBC’s Chuck Todd, he would appoint Supreme Court justices who ""will interpret the Constitution as originally constructed."" Same-sex marriage is not a constitutionally protected right, and marriage laws have always been the responsibility of the states and not the federal government, Rubio said in an interview that aired Dec. 13 on Meet the Press. ""If you want to change the definition of marriage, then you need to go to state legislatures and get them to change it, because states have always defined marriage,"" he said. ""And that's why some people get married in Las Vegas by an Elvis impersonator. And in Florida, you have to wait a couple days when you get your permit. Every state has different marriage laws."" We wondered if Rubio was right that ""states have always defined marriage."" Rubio’s statement echoes critics of this summer’s Obergefell vs. Hodges Supreme Court ruling who say the specific issue of same-sex marriage should be left to individual states. Rubio has a point that marriage laws are largely the states' responsibility, such as the permit and license laws he noted. But states cannot make laws that violate the Constitution, and the June ruling legalizing same-sex marriage was not the first time the Supreme Court limited state regulation and, essentially, defined marriage. The most pertinent example is the 1967 Supreme Court decision in Loving vs. Virginia, which invalidated any bans on interracial marriages. The court decided unanimously that these bans violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. ""It is true that states have generally defined who can get married and the process by which it happens, unless those laws contradict the Constitution, as you rightly point out in the Loving case,"" said Jason Pierceson, a political science professor at the University of Illinois at Springfield and author of Same-Sex Marriage in the United States: The Road to the Supreme Court. ""States have primary control in many policy areas, but those powers are limited by the 14th Amendment."" Jane Schacter, a Stanford University constitutional law professor, showed us a few more examples of the Supreme Court overturning state marriage laws on 14th Amendment grounds. In 1971’s Boddie vs. Connecticut, the court found a Connecticut law requiring poor people to pay a fee to get divorced violated the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. Seven years later, in Zablocki vs. Redhail, the court overturned a Wisconsin statute barring fathers who were behind on child support payments from getting married. And in Turner vs. Safley, the court in 1987 said a Missouri statute barring inmates from getting married was unconstitutional. ""There is no unrestricted prerogative of a state to do whatever it wishes with respect to marriage, Constitution be damned,"" Schacter said. ""But it is always case by case."" Pierceson added that the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which passed Congress with bipartisan support, is another example of the federal government making a law affecting the definition of marriage. The law, which the court struck down in 2013, defined marriage as one man and one woman for federal purposes, such as tax provisions that take marital status into account. Marriage isn’t the only place where states make their own laws and then the Supreme Court can overturn them if they’re unconstitutional, said Kermit Roosevelt, a constitutional law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. For example, states run their own elementary education systems, but they cannot segregate their public schools because that would be unconstitutional. ""You can argue about whether (the same-sex marriage decision) has a firm basis in the Constitution,"" Roosevelt said. ""But it's not out of the ordinary just because it's a constitutional limit on state marriage laws."" Rubio’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Our ruling Rubio said, ""States have always defined marriage."" Rubio has a point that states are generally in charge of administering marriage within their boundaries. However, his statement implies that state marriage regulations were untouched by the federal government up until the Supreme Court’s decision to legalize same-sex marriage, and that is not the case. There are numerous 20th century examples of the Supreme Court overturning state marriage regulations that it found to be unconstitutional, including the 1967 decision to invalidate laws banning interracial marriages",Half True,"December 13, 2015"

""Paul Ryan would be the most liberal, pro-union, Republican speaker in history,"" said the release, quoting North Carolina Republican Kay Daly, who is running against a GOP incumbent for Congress. ""He is one of only six House Republicans who voted for Teddy Kennedy’s bill to force Christian employers to hire LGBT employees. Even John Boehner never did that!"" As we’ll see, there are problems with each part of the claim. Ryan’s vote The Constitutional Rights PAC, based outside of Washington, D.C., says it ""exists to advocate constitutional governance and remind elected servants of the oaths they swore to uphold."" The PAC takes credit for forcing Boehner, Ryan’s predecessor, to resign, and it ran a ""Fire Kevin McCarthy"" campaign before the California Republican unexpectedly dropped his bid to be speaker.   The PAC’s attack on Ryan is in reference to the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, known as ENDA, which aims to prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. It has been introduced a number of times, beginning in 1994, but has never become law. The late U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., was the main sponsor of the 1996 version of ENDA. The measure died after failing in the Senate on a 50-49 vote. So, there was no House vote on the Kennedy bill. Moreover, Ryan wasn’t elected to the House until 1998, two years later. A 2007 version of ENDA did pass the House, 235-184. There was never a vote in the Senate. According to a New Yorker article on the history of ENDA legislation, the measure died because it did not include protection for transgendered persons. Ryan voted yes on that measure. ""They didn’t roll out of bed one morning and choose to be gay. That’s who they are,"" he once said, acknowledging he ""took a lot of grief"" for the ENDA vote from fellow Republicans. The Constitutional Rights PAC, in its original news release, said Ryan was one of only six GOP House members who voted yes. That’s wrong. The release was later revised to say 10. But even that count is misleading, in that it only refers only to Republican House members who voted yes on the 2007 bill and are still in the House. As we noted, Ryan was among a total of 35 GOP House members who voted yes. Ten are still in the House, plus two others who voted yes are now in the Senate. The bill The thrust of the PAC’s claim is that the bill Ryan backed would have forced Christian employers to hire people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. That part of the claim is in error in that the bill did not include transgender people. And the ""force"" part of the claim, particularly as it applies to ""Christian employers,"" goes too far. The bill would have prohibited employers of 15 or more persons from discriminating in employment -- including hiring, firing and compensation -- on the basis of actual or perceived sexual orientation. At the same time, it would have prohibited the adoption of quotas or granting preferential treatment to an individual based on their sexual orientation. What’s more, the bill had a religious exemption. For example, it did not apply to a ""religious corporation, association, educational institution, or society which has as its primary purpose religious ritual or worship or the teaching or spreading of religious doctrine or belief."" The bill would not have applied, for example, to a religious school in the hiring of teachers who taught religious tenets, though it would have applied in the hiring of more general positions, such as janitor. There would not have been a general exemption, however, for employers who are Christian. For example, under the bill, a Christian owner of a dry cleaning business would have been in violation of the law to not hire a qualified job applicant simply because the person was gay. Madison attorney Tamara Packard, who has taught sexual orientation and the law as an adjunct professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School, pointed out to us that there was no affirmative action element or quota in the legislation. (She also noted that, despite that federal ENDA legislation has never become law, discrimination in employment against people based on sexual orientation is illegal under Wisconsin law. The state law also includes a religious employer exemption.) So, it’s a stretch to say the ENDA bill Ryan voted for would ""force"" Christian employers -- or any employers, for that matter -- to hire lesbian, gay or bisexual people. Walter Olson, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, told us that some employers who would not have otherwise hired a gay person would have been forced to do so, if the person was qualified, or risk violating the law. But what the bill explicitly would have done is prohibit most employers from discriminating against gay, lesbian and bisexual people based on their sexual orientation -- which isn’t the same as requiring they be hired. Our rating The Constitutional Rights PAC said Ryan ""is one of only six House Republicans who voted for Teddy Kennedy's bill to force Christian employers to hire LGBT employees."" Ryan was among 35 House Republicans, including 10 still in the House (not six), who voted for a so-called ENDA bill that would have prohibited employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. The ENDA bill Ryan voted for, in 2007, was not Kennedy’s bill from 1996. The 2007 bill would have protected lesbian, gay and bisexual people, but not transgender people. The bill, which exempted religious organizations in the hiring of certain employees, would not have forced employers to hire lesbian, gay and bisexual people but rather would have prohibited discriminating against them based on sexual orientation",False,"October 28, 2015"
"HIV/AIDS is ""dramatically on the rise in the U.S. South.""","Celebrity just keeps elbowing its way into the 2016 presidential race. It could be argued that it started with Donald Trump. The man known best to many Americans as the star of the long-running ""Apprentice"" reality TV show jumped into the presidential race in June and into first place in the crowded field of Republican contenders. And it continued last week in advance of the first Democratic debate. That’s when CNN decided to ask some of the rich and famous what question they’d like to put to candidates Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Martin O’Malley, Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee. Celebrities Katy Perry and Margaret Cho said they’d pose questions about LGBT rights and the abortion/Planned Parenthood funding flap. Other headliners said they would press the candidates on the hot-button issues of gun control, jobs for the middle class and medical marijuana. Atlanta’s own part-time celebrity-in-residence --  Sir Elton John -- said his question to the candidates would be about his personal passion, the fight against HIV/AIDS. ""In spite of great progress, HIV/AIDS is actually dramatically on the rise in the U.S. South. What would you do as president to help stop this epidemic, particularly among minority communities?"" John said he’d ask. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, about 1.2 million Americans are living with HIV, and about 12.8 percent of them don’t know they’re infected. HIV/AIDS didn’t wind up a discussion point in the first Democratic debate. But PolitiFact Georgia decided John had a point worth checking. Is HIV/AIDS dramatically on the rise in the South? We began our fact-check by contacting the Elton John AIDS Foundation in New York City, asking for evidence backing up John’s statement. The foundation was quick to respond, sending us, among other things, a link to a story that appeared in The Washington Post in September 2014 under the headline ""Southern States are now epicenter of HIV/AIDS in the U.S."" The article quoted Rainey Campbell, then-executive director of the nonprofit Southern AIDS Coalition, as saying Southern states now have the highest rates of new HIV diagnoses, the largest percentage of people living with the disease and the most people dying from it. The foundation also sent a link to a report by the Southern HIV/AIDS Strategy Initiative (SASI) from November 2012, examining HIV epidemiology in the South using 2010 data from the CDC and other government agencies. The report focused on nine states in the South that were identified as ""particularly affected by HIV""  -- Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. The targeted states had the highest rates of HIV diagnoses in the United States -- 23.8 per 100,000 -- according to the CDC data, the report found. The South, the report said, makes up a third of the country’s population, but is home to more than half of the new HIV diagnoses. Nine of the 10 metropolitan areas with the highest HIV incidence rates, and seven of the 10 with the highest AIDS incidence rates, were in the targeted states, according to the report. We decided to check in ourselves with the Atlanta-based CDC to see if we could learn more. Ranking regions by the rate of new HIV diagnoses, the South is highest with 24,323 new cases, or a ratio of 20.5 per 100,00 population, based on the latest data available from 2013. Next highest is the Northeast (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont), with 8,908 new HIV diagnoses, or 15.9 per 100,000 population. The West (Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming) is next with 8,013 new diagnoses, or 10.8 per 100,000 population. And the last is the Midwest (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin) with 6,109 new diagnosis, 9 per 100,000 population, according to the CDC. So clearly the South has a big problem. But we still weren’t sure whether any of this proved that HIV/AIDS was rising dramatically in the South. Couldn’t it be that other regions are doing a better job with education/treatment? Nic Carlisle, executive director of the Southern AIDS Coalition, said it’s likely ""a combination of both."" The most recent CDC surveillance report shows the country was making moderate progress until 2011, when the number of new diagnosis started moving in the wrong direction again -- with only the West showing a decrease in 2012-2013, Carlisle said. The increases were 3.4 percent in the Midwest, 3.2 percent in the Northeast, but substantially greater -- 7.5 percent for the South in 2012-2013, he said. ""True, we’ve have made remarkable progress in addressing the HIV epidemic in the United States. Treatment advances have transformed what was once a fatal diagnosis into a chronic disease for many,"" Carlisle said. ""Unfortunately, while the rest of the country reaps the benefits of this progress, the South is in danger of being left behind."" Even the Obama administration recognizes the need to stem the widening HIV-related health disparities that plague the South. In its update to the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS), the administration set a goal of reducing disparities in the rate of new diagnoses by at least 15 percent among persons living in the Southern United States, Carlisle said. Patrick Sullivan, a professor at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health who has spent much of his career on HIV/AIDS research, said it’s true that the Southern U.S. is disproportionately impacted by HIV. The increases in new diagnoses in the South are occurring only in specific subgroups, Sullivan said.   ""When we look more specifically at HIV diagnoses among young, 13-24 year old, gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) in the South, the story is different: according to CDC data, there was a 25 percent increase in new HIV diagnoses in young gay men in the South between 2008 and 2013. For epidemiologists, this is indeed a dramatic increase,"" he said. ""Finally, even when considering the lack of increases in HIV diagnoses in the South overall, it’s important to note that new HIV infections and new HIV diagnoses in the U.S. have both been stubbornly stable at around 45,000 to 50,000 cases each year,"" Sullivan said. ""And in this context, the lack of substantial decreases in new HIV infections is also a dramatic public health problem."" The Elton John AIDS Foundation has made 31 grants worth a combined $1.4 million aimed at addressing the South's HIV/AIDS epidemic. These includes grants worth $315,000 given out earlier this year, in partnership with The Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation, to six organizations. The Equality Foundation of Georgia and the Racial Justice Action Center, both in Atlanta, were among the latest grant recipients Our ruling CDC data support the claim of superstar and part-time Atlanta resident Elton John that the South is the region most dramatically affected by the HIV epidemic. Whether that’s because cases are rising in the South or declining in other regions, or a combination of both, is not entirely a clear. Data from 2012-13 shows new HIV diagnoses on the rise in most parts of the country, with the largest -- a 7.5 percent increase -- in the South.    John’s overarching point is that the South has seen an increase in AIDS/HIV, greater than any other region in the nation.  The data supports that. You can quibble about whether there is enough of a trend line to term this a dramatic jump in cases. That takes his statement down a notch on the Truth-O-Meter",Mostly True,"October 19, 2015"
"Says ""Bernie Sanders was there when it came to (same-sex) marriage 20 years ago. ... He was there when it wasn't popular.""","Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and his presidential campaign serve as an almost constant reminder that Hillary Clinton has not always taken the lead on issues near and dear to the more liberal members of the Democratic Party. She only recently declared that she opposed the Keystone XL pipeline that would link oil from the tar sand fields of Canada to refineries on the Gulf Coast. On same-sex marriage, Clinton’s views evolved. As PolitiFact has described, in 1999, Clinton both supported the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined marriage as between a man and woman, and legal recognition of civil unions. By 2007, she opposed DOMA, but fell short of backing same-sex marriage. Then in 2013, she came out in favor of same-sex marriage pure and simple. Chuck Todd, the host of NBC’s Meet the Press, focused on same-sex marriage during an interview with Clinton on Sept. 27, 2015. ""Bernie Sanders has been where you are on these issues,"" Todd said. ""Bernie Sanders was there when it came to marriage 20 years ago. Do you think one of the reasons he's doing well right now is some progressives think, ‘Well, you know what? He was there when it wasn't popular.’"" Clinton said Sanders could speak for himself and used the question to attack Republicans. Here, we wanted to look at whether Sanders supported same-sex marriage two decades ago. What we found was long-standing support for gay rights in general, a voting record consistent with same-sex marriage, but not much in the way of public statements on behalf of same-sex marriage itself. An early gay rights backer Todd said Sanders was ""there"" on same-sex marriage 20 years ago, but we found evidence pointing back even further. In the early 1970s, Sanders ran for governor of Vermont under the banner of the Liberty Union party, a coalition of leftist groups. The party platform called for making taxes tougher on corporations and lighter on families, an end to the Vietnam War and a number of measures to get government out of people’s private lives. ""The Liberty Union believe that there are entirely too many laws that regulate human behavior,"" Sanders wrote in an open letter. ""Let us abolish all laws which attempt to impose a particular brand of morality or ‘right’ on people. Let’s abolish all laws dealing with abortion, drugs, sexual behavior (adultery, homosexuality, etc.)."" There’s an image of that letter, thanks to Alternet.  While you could read Sanders’ sweeping reference to all laws dealing with homosexuality as including same-sex marriage, it doesn’t specifically say that. As mayor of Burlington, Vt., Sanders supported a gay pride parade in 1983, saying ""we must all be committed to the mutual respect of each other’s lifestyle."" Sanders also put through a 1984 housing anti-discrimination ordinance that protected people based on ""his or her sexual preference."" In 1995 on the House floor, Sanders came to his feet to chastise a Republican congressman who attacked supporters of a tougher Clean Water Act as ""the same people that would put homos in the military."" According to a Boston Globe article at the time, ""You used the words 'homos in the military,' "" Sanders shouted at Cunningham. ""You have insulted thousands of gay people who have put their lives on the line in countless wars defending this country."" So Sanders has a long track record on the side of gay rights in general. When it comes to same-sex marriage and Todd's reference to ""20 years ago,"" Todd is pointing to Sanders' votes related to the Defense of Marriage Act. The Defense of Marriage Act of 1996 In May 1996, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., introduced a bill most notable for its section on definitions. The bill, best known as DOMA, empowered states to disregard same-sex marriages that might be legal in other states. It also defined marriage as ""only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word ‘spouse’ refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife."" Sanders had a couple of key opportunities to vote as DOMA moved through the House. As the bill was headed for a final vote, Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., offered an amendment that would allow each state to set its own definition of marriage. Sanders joined about 100 lawmakers in supporting Frank’s amendment, far short of the total needed. On DOMA itself, Sanders was part of a smaller group of opponents, just 67. The bill passed and President Bill Clinton signed it in September. We wondered if Sanders made any public statements about DOMA in 1996. A search of the Congressional Record and the Nexis news database turned up nothing. His campaign staff couldn’t provide any examples from that time. We contacted Susan Murray, a Burlington lawyer and a co-founder of the Vermont Freedom to Marry Task Force. Murray said members of her group met with Sanders in 1996. ""He opposed DOMA and explicitly told Freedom to Marry so,"" Murray told us. ""The meeting was not focused on whether Bernie affirmatively supported marriage equality."" Same-sex marriage was not on the legislative table in the mid 1990s. When Todd said Bernie was on board before it was popular, the survey numbers back him up. In 1996, Gallup found that 68 percent of the public opposed marriage between couples of the same sex. Vermont passed a civil union law in 2000. Sanders supported it. The year before, Gallup found that 62 percent of the public opposed marriages between people of the same sex. In 2006, Sanders opposed a Republican-sponsored constitutional amendment that defined marriage as between a man and a woman. In an Associated Press interview, Sanders said the measure was designed to divide the public, and he praised Vermont’s civil union law. Vermont ""led the way,"" but noted that it was ""a very divisive debate."" The AP reported that when asked if Vermont should legalize same-sex marriage, Sanders said, ""Not right now, not after what we went through."" Our ruling Todd said that Sanders was ""there"" 20 years ago on the issue of same-sex marriage. What we found specific to same-sex marriage is that Sanders opposed defining marriage exclusively as between a man and a woman. He expressed that opinion through his votes, and in conversations with activists in his state. Todd’s claim is accurate",True,"September 29, 2015"
No openly gay man has ever been elected to the Georgia Legislature.,"Just months after a historic U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage, an Atlanta newspaper that focuses on LGBT news says Georgia may be poised to make history of its own. If elected, two announced candidates for seats in the Georgia House of Representatives would become the first gay men elected to the state Legislature, according to the Georgia Voice. ""Roughly a dozen have tried and failed in the last decade,"" Patrick Saunders wrote in the piece examining the campaigns of Rafer Johnson and Josh Noblitt. But gay lawmakers, and allies, led the unsuccessful fight against Georgia’s 2004 ban on same-sex marriage and were part of the effort to kill state religious freedom bills for the past two years. So with lawmakers pledging to bring back, for the third, time, the religious freedom bill, PolitiFact Georgia wondered: Did voters never send an openly gay man ever to the 236-member General Assembly? The relatively short history of gay lawmakers Openly gay state lawmakers are a somewhat new phenomenon, and not just in Georgia. The first such official appears to be now-U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin, an open lesbian who was elected to the Wisconsin Assembly in 1992. She was one of just six openly gay political candidates to win a general election that year nationwide. A lesbian was also the first openly gay state lawmaker in Georgia. Democrat Karla Drenner was elected to the state House in 2000 and has since represented the District 85 in the Avondale Estates area. We reached out to Saunders for his source about openly gay men in the Legislature. He cited the paper’s own archives, including a story last year that highlighted three openly gay men running for the state House. All three of those candidates – Republican Christopher Deraney for House District 78 representing parts of Clayton County; Democrat Bob Gibeling for House District 54 in Buckhead; and Democrat Timothy Swiney for Senate District 9 in Gwinnett – lost. In the news The Atlanta Journal-Constitution archives turned up a record year in 2006, when four openly gay candidates ran in the primary election. Drenner won her first opposed election since her first win. The late Allen Thornell, a gay activist running for a district representing Cabbagetown in Atlanta, narrowly lost what was then described as the opportunity to be the first openly gay man elected as a legislator. The other two candidates lost. But what about the other gay lawmakers cited in news articles about the religious liberty bill and other issues since? Two lesbians, both Democrats, have been elected after Drenner. Simone Bell was elected to represent east Atlanta area neighborhoods in House Distict 58, the one that Thornell almost won previously, in 2009. Keisha Waites took office in 2012 representing House District 60, covering southeast Atlanta, Hapeville and parts of Clayton and DeKalb counties. And, one gay man has served. At 27, Rashad Taylor was the youngest member of the General Assembly when he was elected in 2008. But he was not elected as a gay man. He came out as gay in 2011, after an anonymous accuser sent an email to media accusing him of misconduct. Taylor lost re-election in 2012 after being placed in the same district as another Democrat by Republican lawmakers during a legislative redistricting. Saunders cited Taylor in his answer to us – and subsequently updated his story – to note that while Taylor had served, he had not been elected as an openly gay man. Outside groups There is little doubt that an openly gay elected state lawmaker would make the news. But Politifact Georgia also reached out to some advocacy groups that keep varying track of openly gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people elected officials. The Victory Fund, which works to elect those candidates, is likely the best known on the national scene. However, officials from the Washington, D.C. group did not respond to emails and phone calls. A list of openly gay officials on the Victory Fund website was down, making their records unavailable for review. Jeff Graham of Georgia Equality, a nonpartisan LGBT advocacy group, said there wouldn’t have been any openly gay men on those lists anyway. Graham’s group follows elections in Georgia and has long been concerned with what he calls viable openly gay candidates. ""They need to be good quality candidates who can run a race and be feasible to win,"" Graham said. ""That takes financial resources, a good ground game to reach the voters and a good grasp of all issues. The last couple election cycles we’ve had openly gay men run but not run what I would consider viable campaigns."" That may, in fact, change in 2016. Johnson is a somewhat known community advocate who would represent a Democratic stronghold in House District 62, which includes portions of College Park, Douglasville, East Point and parts of Fulton and Douglas counties. Noblitt is a minister at Saint Mark United Methodist Church and close with state Rep. Margaret Kaiser, who is stepping down to make a run for mayor. The Democratic district includes several Atlanta neighborhoods such as Inman Park, Reynoldstown and Poncey-Highland. ""A lot of it has to do with a particular district, and I suspect the Ponce district is more amenable than others would be,"" said Kerwin Swint, the director of the political science department at Kennesaw State University. ""Things like this are going to happen very quickly and it could very quickly have an impact on the discussion at the Capitol,"" he added. Our ruling A newspaper focused LGBT news recently said that no gay man has ever been elected to the Georgia Legislature. Newspaper archives and a statewide advocacy group that follows the issue back up the claim. Voters have sent three lesbians to serve under the Gold Dome. And one man came out during his stint in office but lost his next election",True,"September 28, 2015"
"There is not ""one of the Muslim nations"" that doesn't have ""discrimination against women, discrimination against gays, subjugation of other religious beliefs.""","Muslim values are inconsistent with American values, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said recently. Carson has been on the defense for saying he doesn’t believe a Muslim should be president. A couple of days later, in a Sept. 22 interview with Fox’s Megyn Kelly, the former neurosurgeon justified his position by criticizing the governments of Muslim countries for their human rights records. ""If you look throughout the world at Muslim government, I see discrimination against women, discrimination against gays, subjugation of other religious beliefs,"" said Carson, a resident of West Palm Beach, Fla. ""And I would be very interested in somebody showing me one of the Muslim nations where that is not occurring. I haven't seen it."" We decided to help Carson out and look into whether there are Muslim countries -- that is, those with a majority-Muslim population -- with governments that don’t discriminate against women, members of the LGBT community and religious minorities. Carson does have a point that a majority of the 50-odd Muslim countries do have poor records in all three categories. However, he overlooks some important exceptions. Women’s rights To assess women’s rights in these countries, we turned to the World Economic Forum’s 2014 Global Gender Gap Index, as well as the 2014 Social Institutions and Gender Index report published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD. The Gender Gap Index ranks 142 countries based on gender disparities within each nation, including economic opportunity, educational attainment, political empowerment and health. The United States is No. 20, while Iceland is No. 1. By this measure, the 34 Muslim countries on this list don’t have a solid record on gender equality. Just eight crack the top 100 -- Kazakhstan (43), Kyrgyzstan (67), Bangladesh (68), Senegal (77), Albania (83), Azerbaijan (94), Indonesia (97) and Brunei (98). The OECD index instead measures how much gender discrimination a country’s institutions project. Although it isn’t ranked on the overall index list, the United States is listed as ""low"" or ""very low"" discrimination in all categories except ""civil liberties,"" for which it is labeled ""medium"" discrimination -- for reasons such as low numbers of female elected leaders and no national paid maternity or paternity leave. Of the 43 Muslim countries included in the report, most have ""high"" to ""very high"" levels of institutional discrimination in most categories. Just three are categorized as ""low"" discrimination across the board -- Kazakhstan, Morocco and Turkey. Labeled ""medium"" are Tunisia, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Senegal and Indonesia. It’s also worth noting that multiple Muslim countries have had female heads of government or heads of state, including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Turkey, Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan and Senegal. Zakia Salime, an expert in gender and Islam at Rutgers University, also pointed out that numerous Muslim countries signed the U.N. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, while the United States did not. She added that abortion is legal in some Muslim countries, including Turkey. LGBT rights We had a little more trouble pinning down which, if any, Muslim countries have little institutional discrimination against the LGBT community. We did, at least, figure out which ones criminalize homosexuality, according to the Human Rights Campaign and the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, both advocacy groups. Of 48 majority-Muslim countries, homosexual relations are legal in 13: Albania, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Burkina Faso, Chad, Djibouti, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan, Mali, Tajikistan and Turkey. In some of these countries where homosexual activity is legal, there is still some institutional discrimination against LGBT people -- such as a ban on cross-dressing in Bahrain. In some other Muslim nations, homosexuality is legal in parts of the country. As for same-sex marriage, it is not legal in any majority-Muslim nation. Religious freedom As far as institutional challenges to religious freedom, we looked at democracy advocacy group Freedom House’s 2015 Freedom in the World report. In coming up with their overall freedom index, Freedom House scored each of the countries it assessed based on ""freedom of expression and belief."" The United States scored a 15 out of 16 in this category. Of the 47 Muslim countries included in the study, nine got a score higher than 10 out of 16 in ""freedom of expression and belief"": Tunisia (13), Sierra Leone (12), Senegal (15), Niger (11), Mali (11), Lebanon (11), Indonesia (12), Burkina Faso (13) and Albania (13). Notably, Senegal received the same score as the United States. But many Muslim countries got low scores in this category -- including seven nations that scored just a one or two. We also looked at Muslim countries in the State Department’s 2013 Religious Freedom Report. The department reported a vast majority of these countries as having some institutional restrictions on religious freedom. But the report said several Muslim countries had no significant restrictions -- mostly overlapping with the countries that received high scores on the Freedom House list. In sum While there are many majority-Muslim nations that do have a record of institutional discrimination against women, members of the LGBT community and religious groups, there are plenty of exceptions. These exceptions are enough to call into question Carson’s implication that none of the nearly 50 Muslim countries -- and by extension the world’s 1.7 billion Muslims -- respect these rights. Many Muslim countries have a longstanding tradition of democratic rule, particularly in the Far East, such as Bangladesh, said Ahmed Souaiaia, a professor of Islamic law and human rights at the University of Iowa. Souaiaia said he has conducted research in Tunisia, where religious minorities and women’s rights are protected in the country’s constitution. ""To reduce the actions, beliefs and views of 1.7 billion people to a stereotype is stunning,"" Souaiaia said. Our ruling Ben Carson said there is not ""one of the Muslim nations"" that doesn't have ""discrimination against women, discrimination against gays, subjugation of other religious beliefs."" Carson has a point that many countries with a majority-Muslim population do have poor records on institutional discrimination against women, members of the LGBT community and religious minorities. However, his broad-brush statement glosses over the fact that such policies are not universal. Numerous Muslim countries offer freedoms in each category",Mostly False,"September 25, 2015"
Says the case of a Texas judge who refused to perform heterosexual weddings exposes a double standard in the case against Kentucky clerk Kim Davis.,"Kentucky clerk Kim Davis is back on the job. The Rowan County official drew an ardent following when she refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. She also spent a few days in jail for failing to follow a U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing such unions. This prompted a group on Facebook called Conservative News Today to post an interesting comparison. ""Lesbian judge Tonya Parker refused to perform heterosexual marriages for three years. Never reprimanded. ""Christian clerk Kim Davis obeys Kentucky law and U.S. constitution. Gets thrown in jail."" Here’s the image shared by at least 59,000 people:  Set aside the accuracy of the statement that Davis obeyed the law. (The U.S. Supreme Court does have the final word on constitutional issues.) At the heart of this post is the claim that the case of a Texas judge who refused to perform heterosexual weddings exposes a double standard in the case against Kentucky clerk Kim Davis. That comparison falls wide of the facts. Judge Tonya Parker Parker was elected to the 116th Judicial District Court of Texas in 2010. She was the first openly homosexual person elected to a judgeship in Dallas County, and in 2012, she said in a speech that she was refusing to perform marriage ceremonies until same-sex couples gained the same rights as their opposite-sex counterparts. ""I don't perform marriage ceremonies because we are in a state that does not have marriage equality and until it does, I'm not going to partially apply the law to one group of people that doesn't apply to another group of people,"" Parker told a meeting of the Stonewall Democrats of Dallas. Parker later explained in an email to news organizations that ""I do not, and would never, impede any person's right to get married."" She simply declined to conduct marriage ceremonies herself. Given that at that time, the only legal marriages in Texas were between opposite-sex couples, de facto, Parker was refusing to marry heterosexuals. We should note that she didn’t single out such couples. They were the only ones she had the opportunity not to officiate over. According to news reports, Parker faced no official sanctions as a result of her policy. Does that put her in the same boat as Davis? No. Judges and clerks play different roles The side-by-side comparison treats judges and clerks as if they play the same role in the marriage process. That's not true. While it is the responsibility of clerks to issue marriage licenses, judges do not share that obligation. Generally speaking, judges don’t marry people, said Alexandra Albright, who teaches Texas civil procedure at the University of Texas at Austin Law School. ""They can perform marriages in Texas, but it’s not their job,"" Albright said. ""Most judges I know marry people they know. It’s a thing they do for friends."" Albright said a judge like Parker is expected to spend her time presiding over lawsuits brought before her. When it comes to marriage ceremonies, the Texas code authorizes a range of people to officiate. The list includes clergy, a designated officer of any religious organization, a variety of judges, justices of the peace, and retired judges and justices of the peace. In contrast, a clerk like Davis holds a unique gatekeeper position in the marriage process. ""You can’t get married without a marriage license,"" Albright said. ""There all kinds of people who can perform wedding ceremonies."" Our ruling A conservative group on Facebook said the case of a Texas judge who refused to perform heterosexual weddings exposes a double standard in the case against Kentucky clerk Kim Davis. The comparison fails because a judge in Texas and a clerk in Kentucky play different official roles in the marriage process. Texas law authorizes many people, including judges, to perform marriages. Doing so is optional. In Kentucky, couples must have a marriage license issued by a clerk to get married. Davis’ refusal shut the door on marriage for same-sex couples, at least in her county",False,"September 14, 2015"
There is debate among constitutional scholars about whether the First Amendment will continue to protect faith leaders from being forced to perform marriages against their religious beliefs.,"Georgia House Speaker David Ralston, R-Blue Ridge, says June’s 5-4 Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriages is motivating him to pursue passage next year of a ""pastor protection"" bill. A working version of the bill reads: ""No minister of the gospel or cleric or religious practitioner ordained or authorized to solemnize marriages according to the usages of the denomination, when acting in his or her official religious capacity, shall be required to solemnize any marriage in violation of his or her right to free exercise of religion."" It was drawn up shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled June 26 in Obergefell v. Hodges that the U.S. Constitution guarantees a right to same-sex marriage. The decision has been met with resistance in some states. ""In Georgia, we're going to come down clearly on the side of the separation of church and state, and as long as you have constitutional scholars debating among themselves whether this is covered, then I think we need to remove all uncertainty and all doubt."" Ralston said in an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on July 13, two days after he announced plans for his ""pastor protection"" bill. Ralston said his efforts are not connected to the ""religious liberty"" bills that have been at the center of some of the fiercest debates at the Capitol since 2014. Supporters see the ""religious liberty"" legislation as an extra layer of protection against government intrusion on religious beliefs, while critics say it would enable businesses to discriminate against gay customers. But what of the speaker’s claim of a debate among constitutional scholars? PolitiFact decided to dig deeper. First, a little background. Ralston was meeting with House Republicans on Jekyll Island in July when he first disclosed his plans to introduce a ""pastor protection"" bill in the 2016 General Assembly session. Several states have passed or are considering nearly identical bills, and two of these bills just became law in Texas and Oklahoma . Ralston says that in his House district in North Georgia, ""there’s a lot of unease in the faith community over the reach and ramifications"" of the Supreme Court’s decision. ""What we are trying to do is dispel the unease, dispel the uncertainty and replace it with clarity,"" he told a radio reporter last month. What do scholars say? As soon as Ralston announced plans for the bill, some began to question: Was it necessary? Anthony Michael Kreis, a constitutional scholar at the University of Georgia, said nothing in the gay marriage ruling affects the religious freedom protections provided faith leaders under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. They still have the right to refuse to perform any marriage ceremony, Kreis said. Based on Ralston’s statement, suggesting a debate among constitutional scholars, we went in search of other opinions. We contacted constitutional law scholars in Georgia and across the country, including George Washington University law professor Ira C. Lupu and Georgia State University constitutional law professor Eric J. Segall. All said the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment prevents any minister, priest, rabbi or any other cleric from having to perform any religious ceremony - wedding or otherwise - against his or her faith. ""Many, for example, will not perform interfaith weddings,"" said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law expert and founding dean and distinguished professor of law at the University of California. The U.S. Supreme Court ""has never said otherwise,"" Segall said. ""And nothing in the same-sex marriage decision is to the contrary,"" he said. PolitiFact talked by telephone with Ralston, a lawyer by profession, and asked, ""Do you believe they (faith  leaders) are protected under the First Amendment?"" ""Arguably they are,"" the speaker said. He voiced concern that, with a U.S. Supreme Court that evolves, this could one day be an issue litigated in federal court. He also repeated his stance that, within the faith community, ""there’s certainly uncertainty and unease."" But, he acknowledged, ""I don’t think it is the reality."" He went to say: ""We also have to deal with the perception."" In a recent op-ed piece, Ralston wrote that ""the Pastor's Protection Act will make absolutely clear our state government does not view clergy as state actors."" Lupu, a nationally recognized scholar in constitutional law, said a civil marriage, based on its definition, ""is not a matter that has historically been the domain of religious leaders -- certainly not the exclusive domain."" ""Think about divorce laws and how far they depart from Catholic or Orthodox Jewish teaching,"" he said. Lauren Sudeall Lucas, a constitutional law expert and Georgia State University law professor, said the high court in Obergefell v. Hodges was careful to emphasize that it is ""the state"" that cannot refuse to recognize same-sex marriages. Lupu said he knows of no constitutional scholar who believes that the state can dictate to a pastor regarding who qualifies for religious marriage. ""So if Ralston says the Pastor Protection Act is legally necessary and adds something to the substance of the law, then he is speaking falsely,"" Lupu said. ""If he says ‘I know it's not necessary, but it will provide reassurance to some,‘ that cannot be a falsehood, because it will indeed do that."" Our ruling Georgia House Speaker David Ralston has announced he will propose a pastor protection bill, spelling out that faith leaders in the state have the right to refuse to perform any marriage ceremony that goes against their religious convictions. ""In Georgia, we're going to come down clearly on the side of the separation of church and state, and as long as you have constitutional scholars debating among themselves whether this is covered, then I think we need to remove all uncertainty and all doubt,"" Ralston said in an interview two days after announcing plans for the bill. We don’t claim to have reached every constitutional scholar. But we could find no evidence that there are any constitutional scholars who believe the ruling diminishes the First Amendment protections of religious freedom or forces religious leaders to marry people against their personal religious beliefs. Ralston, himself, acknowledges that. But he says there’s unease in the community and a ""perception"" to contend with. That’s a different argument for the bill",Mostly False,"August 12, 2015"
"Says states not directly involved in the gay marriage lawsuits that reached the Supreme Court ""are not bound"" by the court’s ruling.","The U.S. Supreme Court holds ultimate sway on the laws of the land, yes? Hold on, Ted Cruz said in an interview about the court’s 5-4 decision holding that state bans on gay marriage violate federal principles of equal protection and fair treatment under the law, creating a ""grave and continuing harm"" to families led by such couples. After the June 26, 2015, ruling, which addressed challenges to state laws in Ohio, Tennessee, Michigan and Kentucky, Cruz said that if a party isn’t directly involved in a dispute before the Supreme Court, it’s not required to comply with the ruling. ""Those who are not parties to the suit are not bound by it,"" Cruz said. A reader asked us to check Cruz’s claim. The Republican senator and presidential aspirant should know about the high court. He argued before the court on Texas’ behalf in a past job as the state’s solicitor general. In the interview, Cruz told Steve Inskeep, who hosts NPR’s Morning Edition program, that the court’s ruling imposed ""elitist radical views,"" short-circuiting the ability of each state to define marriage. Inskeep asked if Cruz would encourage officials who disagree with the ruling to ignore or defy it. State officials ""cannot ignore a direct judicial order,"" Cruz said. ""The parties to a case cannot ignore a direct judicial order. But it does not mean that those who are not parties to case are bound by a judicial order."" INSKEEP: ""Did I understand you to say just now that as you read the law, as you read our system, this decision is not binding on the entire country, only to the specific states that were named in the suit."" CRUZ: ""Article III of the Constitution gives the court the authority to resolve cases and controversies. Those cases and controversies, when they're resolved, when you're facing a judicial order, the parties to that suit are bound (by) it. Those who are not parties to the suit are not bound by it. Now, in subsequent litigation, other courts will follow the precedence of the court, but a judicial order only binds those to whom it is directed, those who are parties to the suit. That's the way our litigation system works."" (See fuller excerpts of this part of the interview here.) We alerted Cruz’s campaign to this fact check and didn’t hear back. Legal experts Separately, several legal experts told us the idea that states not party to the marriage cases weren’t bound by the court’s ruling may have technical merit, but that’s all. Richard Fallon, a Harvard specialist in constitutional law, said by email that under the doctrine of precedent, ""any official who failed to issue gay marriage licenses would be sueable for failure to do so, and any court in which the suit was filed would be obliged to follow the Supreme Court’s gay marriage ruling.  In the long run, non-compliance thus amounts at most to a delaying tactic.  And there are lots of complicated questions about whether officials should regard themselves as obliged to do what they know a court would order them to do if they were sued — even if they are not technically bound by the Supreme Court’s ruling.  But on Senator Cruz’s technical point, he is probably correct, if you understand it as being only a very limited, technical point about a delaying tactic."" In contrast, Lynn Wardle, a law professor at Brigham Young University who has advocated that the Constitution leaves it to legislators to stipulate who may marry, called Cruz’s statement ""precisely correct."" Entities not party to a suit are not bound by the resulting judicial order, Wardle said by email, adding: ""That’s the way our litigation system works."" Only parties before the court are bound by its judgment and orders, Randy Barnett, a professor of legal theory at the Georgetown University Law Center, said by email, but all other courts are bound to follow the court (which Cruz hinted at). So, Barnett wrote, ""it is futile for states who are not parties to resist. More importantly, when a ruling is clear, ignoring the Supreme Court's decisions until a court directly orders them to obey undermines the rule of law. Bad people say ‘we won't obey the law until you make us.’ Unless they are engaged in justified civil disobedience — in which case they are liable to be punished — good people follow the law before they are directly commanded."" If nonparties to the suits don’t go along with the ruling, he said, ""they are postponing the inevitable and flouting the rule of law that was announced by the Court."" Stephen Vladeck, an American University law professor, called Cruz’s statement ""literally true, but deeply misleading. Technically, the only parties that are bound by a ruling by the Supreme Court are the parties to that litigation — and so, in the context of the marriage cases, the small subset of states whose bans on gay marriage were before the Court. ""But the way our system works,"" Vladeck emailed, ""every state and federal court is ultimately subject to the supervision of the Supreme Court at least where federal law is concerned. That’s why those courts generally apply the Constitution as it has been interpreted by the Justices in Washington; if they don’t, they’re likely to be reversed."" Asked if Wardle had a point saying Cruz was precisely correct, Vladeck said that read is misleading in that states still have to go along with such a ruling, absent a good-faith reason not to. In the ""immediate aftermath of a decision like this one, when there is no reason to think the Supreme Court would answer the question any differently were a different state a party to the suit,"" Vladeck said, ""it’s unreasonable for a state official or state court to decline to follow that ruling. They’re not literally bound to do so (and, thus, can’t be held in contempt for failing to do so), but they are practically bound by dint of the Supreme Court’s appellate jurisdiction."" By phone, Susan Sommer, the lead lawyer for Lambda Legal in the suits that reached the Supreme Court, suggested that ""only in the very most technical and hair-splitting way could it be said that the Supreme Court’s ruling is not immediately and directly binding on every state government and government official in the country."" Sommer said she knows of no legitimate school of thought that could say the ruling doesn’t apply to all the states. ""It’s sort-of Law School 101,"" Sommer said. We also heard back from SCOTUS Blog reporter Lyle Denniston, who’s covered the Supreme Court for more than 50 years. The Constitution’s Article III, Denniston said by email, limits the authority of federal courts to actual cases or controversies, so the outcome is between the actual litigants, as Cruz said. Then again, he said, ""the Supreme Court since 1803 (Marbury v. Madison) has claimed the authority to ‘say what the law is’ constitutionally, and its conclusions on what the Constitution means in a given case are made binding across the land, as a result of the reinforcement of its authority by the Supremacy Clause of Article VI"" of the Constitution. Denniston further said: ""The Supreme Court, in the 1958 decision in Cooper v. Aaron (the Little Rock high school integration case), said explicitly that the combination of the Marbury decision and Article VI made the Supreme Court's decisions binding on the states. That decision, by the way, is the only"" one ""in history where each of the nine Justices explicitly signed the opinion to give it more force."" Article VI says the Constitution shall be the ""supreme Law of the Land"" with judges bound to it along with legislators and executive and judicial officers, state and federal. Our ruling Cruz said states not directly involved in the gay marriage lawsuits that reached the Supreme Court ""are not bound"" by the court’s ruling. He has a thread of a point in that only four states were directly involved in the case. But that’s an incomplete answer to the question of whether states could ignore the court’s ruling. Other courts would be bound by the Supreme Court’s precedent, making the ruling applicable throughout the nation. That’s a fact that Cruz alluded to only after being pressed by the interviewer for clarification of his earlier misleading statement",Mostly False,"July 31, 2015"
"""In a majority of states, you can now marry freely, but can still be fired for who you love.""","After the U.S. Supreme Court announced its decision making same-sex marriage the law of the land, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan called for additional rights to be recognized for gay Americans. Pocan, a Democrat from Madison, has long been an advocate of government allowing same-sex marriage. Years after Pocan married his partner in Canada, he made headlines in 2013 when his husband was issued an ID given only to spouses of members of Congress. Pocan issued a statement on June 26, 2015 praising the high court’s landmark ruling, but also to argue the fight for gay rights is not over. ""Today, the Supreme Court has reaffirmed what a majority of Americans already know: all couples should have the right to marry, regardless of who they love. ""As we celebrate this victory, we must also recognize that we still have work to do to ensure all Americans are treated fairly under the law, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity."" The next step in the gay rights movement: ""In a majority of states you can now marry freely,"" Pocan said, ""but can still be fired because of who you love."" The first part of Pocan's claim refers back to the Supreme Court ruling. And after the ruling, Pocan is obviously on point -- not only is same sex marriage permitted in a majority of states, it is allowed everywhere. But what about the second half of the claim, which focuses on workplace discrimination. Can someone be legally terminated in most states because of their sexual orientation? Let’s take a look. The legal landscape The Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects workers from discrimination at the federal level. Title VII of the law prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin. Title VII's definitions of ""because of sex"" and ""on the basis of sex"" do not mention sexual orientation.   So, there is no federal law that explicitly forbids employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. Legislation has been proposed and failed in nearly every Congress since 1974 that would prohibit employment discrimination because of sexual orientation or gender identity. In the 1989 Supreme Court case Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, the court ruled sex stereotyping is a form of discrimination protected against under Title VII. Some extend this ruling to protect gay workers who do not conform to gender norms. Gwendolyn Leachman, an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School, said evidence showing the employee was discriminated against for failure to conform to gender stereotypes is necessary. ""If the employer can show that the harassment or other adverse action was motivated ‘purely’ by sexual orientation, then the employee is out of luck,"" Leachman said. Some courts follow the EEOC interpretation. In Terveer v. Billington, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in March 2014 that the discrimination based on someone's status as homosexual was based on gender stereotypes and was covered under Title VII.   But not all courts agree. In fact, Terveer v. Billington is an outlier. And the Supreme Court has yet to hear a case on this matter. Nearly every state has adopted an anti-discrimination law similar to the federal Civil Rights Act. Indeed, many of the state laws provide additional protection for sexual orientation. In a June 2014 fact check of another statement made by Pocan, we learned Wisconsin was the first state to enact a law banning discrimination because of sexual orientation. So how many states followed suit?   Pocan's team sent  a map from the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT civil rights advocacy group, to support his claim.   The map showed that 22 states have explicit laws protecting workers from discrimination based on sexual orientation. That means 28 states -- a majority -- do not have explicit laws protecting workers from discrimination based on sexual orientation. Our rating Pocan said, ""in a majority of states you can now marry freely, but can still be fired for who you love."" Federal law does not explicitly protect against this discrimination, though the agency tasked with enforcing the law has interpreted federal protections to include sexual orientation. Meanwhile, 28 out of 50 states do not have such laws",Mostly True,"July 9, 2015"
"The Supreme Court’s views ""are radically out of step with public opinion"" regarding its decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide.","The Supreme Court’s decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide isn’t what the American people wanted, says Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Cruz, who is running for president, is an outspoken critic of the court’s 5-4 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges that overturned the country’s remaining same-sex marriage bans. In an interview on Morning Edition June 29, NPR’s Steve Inskeep talked with Cruz about how he and other Republicans will respond. ""The concern of conservatives seems to be that the court was following public opinion,"" Inskeep said. ""Same-sex marriage, for example, is much more popular than it used to be."" Cruz responded, ""Well, Steve, let me actually disagree with your premise. The court doesn't follow public opinion. The court’s views are radically out of step with public opinion."" ""If the values had changed so much, there would be no need for the court to act because people would have acted democratically to change their marriage laws,"" Cruz added. ""That hadn't happened, which is why the court stepped in and (threw) out the laws that the people did adopt."" Given the swelling support for same-sex marriage in recent years, we wanted to dig into Cruz’s claim that ""the court’s views are radically out of step with public opinion."" To be clear: The claim could be interpreted as speaking about the court’s decisions generally. But given the context of the statement and our interaction with Cruz’s campaign, it seems he was talking about same-sex marriage specifically, so that’s what we’ll focus on. There’s a couple of different ways to look at this, but Cruz’s characterization is an exaggeration. A look at the polls On whether the American public supports same-sex marriage, there is no question. Numerous 2015 polls have found that a majority of the country -- around 60 percent -- favors same-sex marriage. The majority holds in most demographic groups. Support for same-sex marriage has risen dramatically in the past few years, as demonstrated by this Gallup chart, spanning 20 years:  But there’s another question that doesn’t have a clear answer -- whether Americans think the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should have been left to the states, rather than having a decision made at the national level. This is essentially the question presented to the Supreme Court. Cruz spokesman Brian Phillips said ""it is incontrovertible that a majority of Americans believe that the decision should be left to the states,"" pointing to a February 2015 CBS News poll that found 56 percent of Americans hold this position. However, other polls show the opposite: that a majority of Americans think same-sex marriage should be decided nationally. A June 2015 poll by CBS News and the New York Times found that just 41 percent of Americans think this is a state issue, while 54 percent think there should be a single federal law. Looking through a collection of the latest polls on gay rights, neither side stands out as the obvious position of the American public. Given the mix of polling results on this question, ""it's not the case that the court's ruling was, as Cruz claimed, ‘radically out of step with public opinion.’ Rather, Americans were less definitive on this aspect of the gay marriage issue than others,"" said New York University professor Patrick Egan, who studies public opinion and gay rights issues. Phillips noted that a majority of states had laws banning same-sex marriage prior to this year’s Supreme Court and earlier lower court decisions -- more than 30 state bans in 2013, before the rulings started to roll out. Because state legislatures or the voters directly passed these laws, Phillips said they ""reflected the popular will of the people in those states."" But timing is important here. These same-sex marriage bans might have reflected popular opinion at the time they were passed -- nearly all came about before 2010 -- but public opinion on gay marriage has changed significantly since then. ""If public opinion is changing -- and the data show it was -- it is possible for both the original legislative decisions and the subsequent court decisions to be consistent with public opinion,"" said Peter Enns, a professor of government at Cornell University who studies public opinion and government response. By 2014, at least 50 percent of residents in 32 states supported same-sex marriage -- including quite a few states that had gay marriage bans prior to court decisions, according to the Public Religion Research Institute. A majority opposed same-sex marriage in only eight states. Additionally, most political scientists would say public opinion is best measured via representative surveys, not by the laws currently in place, Egan noted. So it’s not always fair to say that an existing same-sex marriage ban shows that the people of that state are currently opposed to same-sex marriage legalization. Our ruling Cruz said the Supreme Court’s views ""are radically out of step with public opinion"" regarding its decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide. Most polls say around 60 percent favor same-sex marriage -- a high point. At the state level, the majority holds in most cases. Cruz’s staff said that Americans think legalizing same-sex marriage should be a state responsibility rather than something decided at the federal level. But different polls show different results on that point. There isn’t an obvious majority one way or the other. Certainly there is a good chunk of the population that opposes the Supreme Court’s decision, but it’s definitely not a clear majority",Mostly False,"July 1, 2015"

"Wisconsin's non-discrimination law ""doesn't protect members of the trans-gender community.""","On June 6, 2015, delegates attending the Wisconsin Democratic Party’s annual convention will elect a chairman to succeed Mike Tate, who is stepping down after six years. The youngest of the five candidates is 28-year-old Jason Rae of Milwaukee -- who, at 17, was the youngest person ever elected to the Democratic National Committee. In an interview on April 21, 2015, Wisconsin Eye host Steve Walters asked Rae, who is gay, if it is a victory for the Democratic Party that ""Wisconsin and the nation have made so much progress""  on same-sex issues. ""I don’t think it’s a problem -- I think it’s a real step forward -- but there's a lot of work yet to be done when you look at LGBT issues,"" said Rae, referring to people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. ""You know, we were one of the first states that actually had a non-discrimination ordinance statewide, but it only protected members of the gay and lesbian community; it doesn't protect members of the ‘trans’ community.""    We wondered: Under Wisconsin law, gay, lesbian and bisexual people are protected from discrimination, but not people who are transgender? Transgender explained Transgender, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality, is a broad term for people whose gender identity, expression or behavior is different from those typically associated with their assigned sex at birth. A transgender man, for example, refers to a transgender individual who currently identifies as a man. Transsexual, according to the center, is an ""older term for people whose gender identity is different from their assigned sex at birth who seeks to transition from male to female or female to male. Many do not prefer this term because it is thought to sound overly clinical."" The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention do not attempt to count the number of Americans who identify themselves as transgender. An estimate made in 2011, by an expert in LGBT demography at UCLA Law School, put the figure at nearly 700,000, or 0.3 percent of the population. The laws We’ll start our analysis by noting that we have rated True a claim by U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison. He said Wisconsin, in 1982, became the first state to ban public and private sector employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. That article noted that the law leaves out transgender people. The District of Columbia and 18 states -- including Minnesota, Illinois and Iowa -- have laws that ""clearly prohibit discrimination against transgender people,"" according to the American Civil Liberties Union. By comparison, a map produced by the National Center for Transgender Equality says Wisconsin is among states with laws that protect against discrimination based on sex (gender) or on sexual orientation but don’t have clear protections for gender identity.   We consulted four experts: Larry DuPuis, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin; Rick Esenberg, president and general counsel of the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, a conservative, libertarian public interest law firm; Marquette University law professor Paul Secunda, who directs the law school’s labor and employment law program; and attorney Gordon Leech, who heads the civil rights and liberties section of the State Bar of Wisconsin. Here was the consensus: 1. Wisconsin statutes that prohibit discrimination based on sex or sexual orientation in three areas -- employment, housing and public accommodation -- do not expressly include transgender people. (According to Leech, Milwaukee and Madison include gender identity in ordinances that prohibit discrimination in all three areas. Milwaukee County and Dane County include gender identity in housing and employment discrimination ordinances; and Appleton includes gender identity in its fair housing ordinance.) 2. That means that -- unlike gay men, for example, who have a right to file a complaint alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation -- it’s unknown whether a Wisconsin state court would accept complaints from transgender people alleging discrimination based on their transgender status. 3. Instead, a transgender person would have to persuade a judge that transgender people are covered either by state laws that prohibit discrimination based on sex or on sexual orientation. 4. To date, there has not been a published decision by a state judge in Wisconsin stating that transgender people are covered by those anti-discrimination laws. Our rating Rae said Wisconsin's non-discrimination law ""doesn't protect members of the transgender community."" It’s unclear whether a transgender person could pursue in state court a discrimination case using laws that prohibit discrimination based on sex (gender) or on sexual orientation. What is clear is Wisconsin laws do not expressly prohibit discrimination based on a person’s status as transgender",True,"May 8, 2015"
"""Legislation being considered in Texas would strip the salaries and pensions of clerks who issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples — even if the Supreme Court strikes down Texas’ marriage ban later this year.""","A Texas lawmaker’s attempt to restrict the issuance of same-sex marriage licenses drew backlash all the way from Silicon Valley. In an op-ed article for The Washington Post, Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook suggested certain states are being transparent in their efforts to discriminate against others, particularly those of the LGBT community. Cook, who announced he was gay in October 2014, used Texas as an example: ""Legislation being considered in Texas would strip the salaries and pensions of clerks who issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples — even if the Supreme Court strikes down Texas’ marriage ban later this year."" Cook was also speaking out against Indiana’s ""Religious Freedom Restoration Act,"" which was signed into state law at the end of March by Republican Gov. Mike Pence. The law sparked a national outcry over whether it permitted businesses the ability to discriminate against customers based on religious beliefs, criticism that quieted after Indiana lawmakers amended the legislation to include specific protections for gays and lesbians. But this doesn’t mean other similar bills haven’t been filed in other state legislators including Texas. And is such legislation under consideration in the Lone Star state? Apple doesn't elaborate To our inquiry, Apple Inc. spokeswoman Rachel Wolf declined to say where Cook got his information or to otherwise comment. But we have a hunch Cook was referring to House Bill 623, filed by state Rep. Cecil Bell, R-Magnolia, on Jan. 7, 2015 and drew more than 40 House Republican co-authors though no senator filed a companion. Bell’s HB 623, titled the ""Preservation of Sovereignty and Marriage Act,"" would block pay, pension and benefits of state or local government employees who issue a same-sex marriage license.   Of course, hundreds of proposals are offered by legislators that don’t get voted on. And, given Apple Inc.’s silence, we don’t know how Cook decided this proposal was ""being considered."" In contrast, legislative records indicate HB 623 was referred to a House committee Feb 23 but as of April 14, 2015, more than two weeks after Cook spoke, hadn’t been set for a hearing, though Bell earlier told us he’d requested one. Bell told the Texas Tribune in January 2015 that he filed the proposal to prevent any federal court or federal action from allowing gay marriage in Texas. ""The federal government is trying to act to create moral standards, and that’s just not acceptable,"" Bell said. By phone, Bell told us Cook’s description was a ""correct assessment"" of HB 623. He said county clerks are currently not authorized to issue same-sex marriage licenses in Texas, where the Constitution was amended in 2005 to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman. Bell said those same employees should not be compensated for doing activities that are against state law. ""As with any job, we are subject to the laws that we’re working under,"" Bell said. HB 623 v. SCOTUS  Next, we wondered if a state law can outflank a Supreme Court ruling. Along those lines, we hunted other perspectives. Here’s what’s coming up: On April 28, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear a 150-minute argument regarding four gay marriage cases from Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee challenging a law in each state. Then, before the court’s current term ends in June 2015, the justices are expected to make a ruling — potentially on whether gays and lesbians have the constitutional right to marry or states have the authority to decide restrictions one by one. Asked for his assessment, Jonathan Saenz of the conservative Texas Values group, which says it seeks ""to preserve and advance a culture of family values,"" told us the court might stop short of a sweeping move. ""No one knows how"" the court will rule or even if it will rule, Saenz emailed. Also, he said, its ""ruling may not settle or clarify anything."" Another take: A January 2015 USA Today news article suggested that if the justices determine gays have a right to marry based on the 14th Amendment, and that states have to recognize these marriages when licensed by other states, then Texas’ gay marriage ban would no longer be upheld in federal court. Significantly, as hinted by Cook, Bell’s proposal includes language to supersede the Supreme Court, if necessary. Specifically, section ""H"" of his proposal states: ""The State is not subject to suit in law or equity pursuant to the eleventh amendment of the United States Constitution for complying with the provisions of this section, regardless of a contrary federal court ruling."" Dan Quinn of the liberal Austin-based Texas Freedom Network, which describes itself as ""monitoring far-right issues, organizations, money and leaders,"" suggested this means that under HB 623, even if the Supreme Court endorses same-sex marriage, a Texas county clerk who issues a same-sex marriage license would face state penalties. ""The intention here is to pass laws that would subvert a Supreme Court ruling striking down the same-sex marriage ban,"" Quinn said. Earlier, Bell told us if HB 623 makes it into law, litigation might prove necessary to resolve whether Texas government employees could be penalized for issuing same-sex marriage licenses even after the U.S. Supreme Court’s endorsement of gay marriage. ""Conjecturally, it will call another lawsuit to determine the interaction between state laws and the power of the U.S. Supreme Court,"" Bell said. Not so fast, lawyers on opposite sides of the Supreme Court fight told us by phone. Sarah Warbelow, legal director of the Washington, D.C.-based Human Rights Campaign, which says it’s the nation’s largest LGBT civil rights organization, and Lynn Wardle, a Brigham Young University law professor, each said that if the justices agree on a constitutional right to gay marriage, that judgment would apply in every state, regardless of state laws declaring otherwise. Wardle, who led in writing a March 2015 brief to the court pointing out the limited number of nations that allow gay marriage, said of the Texas proposal’s section H: ""In all candor, that’s some state legislator-politician’s dream. It’s not reality. The states cannot say we are going to order our courts to not follow the Constitution."" Warbelow called the section a kind of ""court stripping,"" generally meaning an effort to eliminate a court’s duties. State legislators can try to do this for state, but not federal, courts, she said. Our ruling  Cook said: ""Legislation being considered in Texas would strip the salaries and pensions of clerks who issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples — even if the Supreme Court strikes down Texas’ marriage ban later this year."" Cook fairly summarized Bell’s legislation. But clarification was missing in that the proposal wasn’t ""being considered"" by lawmakers either then or when we completed our review a couple of weeks later. Like a lot of bills, HB 623 awaited legislative attention",Mostly True,"April 15, 2015"
"Says Bill Clinton signed a law ""very similar to,"" and Barack Obama voted for a law ""something like,"" Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act.","Concerns about Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act were broad enough that the head coaches competing in the Final Four college basketball championship, including Wisconsin's Bo Ryan, issued a joint statement saying ""discrimination of any kind should not be tolerated."" The Indiana law, according to the Human Rights Campaign, which advocates for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans, ""allows individuals to use religion as an excuse to discriminate against LGBT people and other minorities."" Yet later on the day the coaches issued their statement, April 1, 2015, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker called reactions from around the country overblown, saying the new law is not so unusual. Asked by Charlie Sykes, a conservative radio talk show host in Milwaukee, if he would sign Indiana's law, Walker replied: ""We don't need to. In Wisconsin, we have it in our Constitution."" The front-running potential presidential candidate added: ""And remember, it's not just what we have here. I mean, President Clinton signed something very similar to this nationally back in '93. President Obama voted for something like this in the neighboring state of Illinois when he was a state senator. I just think this is people who are chronically looking for ways to be upset about things, instead of really looking at what it is."" So, is the Indiana law merely a similar version of a federal law signed by Bill Clinton and an Illinois law backed by Barack Obama? The backdrop All of this dates back more than 30 years to Alfred Smith and Galen Black. They worked as alcohol and drug counselors at a private drug rehabilitation organization in Oregon. Both were members of the Native American Church and, for sacramental purposes, ingested small amounts of peyote, an illegal, hallucinogenic drug, during a church ceremony. They were later fired, one of them in 1983 and one in 1984. The two were denied unemployment compensation under an Oregon law that disqualified employees who were discharged for work-related ""misconduct"" and their case went to court. In 1990, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that Oregon could prohibit the religious use of peyote, and therefore could deny unemployment compensation to the two workers. That ruling led to federal legislation -- which, like the Indiana law, is called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act -- that Clinton signed into law in 1993. Four years later, however, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the law didn’t apply to states. That kicked off a spree of states passing their own versions of the law. Currently, 21 states have such religious freedom laws. In 2015, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 16 states have introduced legislation regarding the creation of, or alteration to, a state religious freedom law. (Wisconsin is not among the 21 or the 16.) Language The intent of the 1993 federal law was to protect religious practices -- such as Native Americans using peyote as part of religious practices, or a Muslim prison guard wearing a beard -- from government interference. Illinois, in 1998, was among the initial wave of states that approved state versions of the federal law. All Illinois state senators, including Obama, voted for it.   Indiana’s law carries the same title as the federal and Illinois laws and much of the same language. But there are a couple of differences. Under Indiana’s law a ""person"" is extended to mean ""a partnership, a limited liability company, a corporation, a company, a firm, a society, a joint-stock company, an unincorporated association"" or other entity. That doesn’t appear in the federal law. However, the federal law has now been interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court (in what is known as the Hobby Lobby case) to extend in this same way to private companies and associations. Indiana’s law states it can be used to protect religious freedom in private disputes, even if the government is not a party. That provision has been viewed as having been written to specifically cover a situation such as a New Mexico photographer who did not want to participate in a same-sex wedding. However, the day after Walker made his claim, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence signed a revision to the law. The revised law prohibits service providers from using it as a legal defense for refusing to provide goods, services, facilities or accommodations. It also bars discrimination based on race, color, religion, ancestry, age, national origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or U.S. military service. Context On another level, the context between the federal and Illinois laws on the one hand, and the Indiana law on the other, has changed. Whereas the earlier laws were adopted to protect religious practices from government interference, conservatives in Indiana and elsewhere see the Religious Freedom Restoration Act as a vehicle for fighting back against the legalization of same-sex marriage. At the private signing ceremony for the original version of the Indiana law, people who work for groups that oppose same-sex marriage were in attendance. And one of the lobbyists heralded the state’s law as protecting Christian bakers, florists and photographers from penalty ""for refusing to participate in a homosexual marriage, among other examples."" Generally speaking, there isn’t all that much difference between the Indiana law and the Illinois and federal laws. But proponents of the Indiana law are pushing the measure as a way that businesses can seek protection ""for refusing to participate in a homosexual marriage."" That was far from what prompted the federal and Illinois laws. A final note: Another possible GOP presidential contender, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, made a claim similar to Walker’s, saying Florida has a religious freedom law like Indiana’s",Half True,"April 13, 2015"
"Says Ted Cruz said, ""There is no place for gays or atheists in my America. None. Our Constitution makes that clear.""","Here we go again: A reader just pointed out a Facebook meme suggesting Texan Ted Cruz declared America constitutionally off limits to gays and atheists last month when he declared his candidacy for president. We recently found Pants on Fire a Facebook post saying the Canada-born Cruz, the Republican U.S. senator who announced his presidential candidacy at Liberty University in Virginia, had conveniently flip-flopped on each president needing to be born in the United States. Did not happen. The ‘no place’ Facebook post Now let’s turn to the Facebook post brought to our attention most recently:  SOURCE: Facebook post, March 25, 2015 (noted by a PolitiFact reader April 2, 2015) The image had a tagline mentioning a Facebook page titled ""Stop the World, The Teabaggers Want Off."" Off we clicked, learning that Facebook page includes this disclaimer about its posts: ""This page is for entertainment purposes. It is NOT meant to be taken seriously. It is primarily satire and parody with a mix of political memes and messages."" The afternoon we scrolled the page, we didn’t spot the Cruz meme. But the image and purported Cruz statement had been sent out by the group in this March 25, 2015, tweet:  SOURCE: Twitter post, @StopTeabaggers, March 25, 2015 No confirmation in news stories The image did not put the statement in quotation marks. Still, the meme as a whole struck us as leaving the impression that Cruz said it. And it doesn’t look like he did. In fact, online searches and a check of the Nexis news database yielded no evidence Cruz, a Houston lawyer elected to the Senate in 2012, has ever made a comment about the Constitution leaving no place for gays or atheists in his America. To our inquiry about the presented quotation, Cruz campaign spokesman Rick Tyler said by email it’s ""obviously false."" Cruz’s speech declaring for president Next, we scrutinized a Washington Post transcript of Cruz’s March 23, 2015 speech declaring for president. In the speech, Cruz mentioned marriage once, gays and atheists not at all. On marriage, he said: ""Instead of a federal government that works to undermine our values, imagine a federal government that works to defend the sanctity of human life and to uphold the sacrament of marriage."" Cruz didn’t mention atheists, but he emphasized religious faith before students at the university founded by the late Jerry Falwell, an evangelist. For instance, Cruz referred to ""the God-given liberty of every American."" He also said: ""God’s blessing has been on America from the very beginning of this nation, and I believe God isn’t done with America yet."" He closed: ""I am honored to stand with each and every one of you courageous conservatives as we come together to reclaim the promise of America, to reclaim the mandate, the hope and opportunity for our children and our children’s children. We stand together for liberty. ""This is our fight. The answer will not come from Washington. It will come only from the men and women across this country, from men and women, from people of faith, from lovers of liberty, from people who respect the Constitution. ""It will only come as it has come at every other time of challenge in this country, when the American people stand together and say we will get back to the principles that have made this country great. We will get back and restore that shining city on a hill that is the United States of America."" Other Cruz comments Finally, we looked into whether the meme’s quotations reflected on past Cruz comments. Cruz has repeatedly said he doesn’t want gay marriages to be legal, as the Human Rights Campaign, which advocates for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans, spells out in its ""Republican Facts"" web page titled: ""Ted Cruz: Not a Fan of Pride Parades."" In March 2012, Cruz was quoted by Peggy Fikac of the San Antonio Express-News saying: ""I believe that engaging in homosexual conduct is a choice, and I do not believe that unelected judges should force states to adopt gay marriage, against the wishes of the people. Marriage is a fundamental building block of our society, and I have a proven record of standing and fighting to protect traditional marriage between one man and one woman."" Cruz also has stressed his religious faith; he’s a Baptist, Tyler told us. And in spring 2014, Cruz made a public jab about atheists, as recapped April 2, 2014, by the National Journal. Mentioning an Air Force chaplain ordered by his supervisor to take down a religious blog post he'd written, deeming it insensitive to atheists, Cruz said: ""I sort of thought the job of a chaplain is to be insensitive to atheists."" By telephone, Danielle Muscato of American Atheists, which says it’s a ""nonprofit, nonpolitical, educational organization dedicated to the complete and absolute separation of state and church,"" told us she couldn’t confirm Cruz making the ""my America"" claim. Our ruling A Facebook post suggests Cruz said the day he declared for president, ""There is no place for gays or atheists in my America. None. Our Constitution makes that clear."" Cruz has been clear about his belief in God and opposition to legalizing gay marriages. However, there is no record of him saying the Constitution leaves no place for gays or atheists in ""my America",False Pants on Fire,"April 8, 2015"
"Virginia House Speaker Bill Howell is ""allied to group pushing MIXED SEX BATHROOMS in Stafford Schools.""","There’s little subtlety in the strategy guiding Susan Stimpson’s GOP primary challenge against House Speaker Bill Howell for his Stafford County seat. Stimpson, a Tea Party favorite and former chair of county’s board of supervisors, keeps saying Howell has lost his conservative moorings. A case in point is this headline Stimpson posted on her Facebook Page: ""BILL HOWELL is allied to group pushing MIXED SEX BATHROOMS in Stafford Schools."" Flushing out this claim requires two determinations: Is there a group seeking to establish unisex bathrooms in Stafford County schools and, if so; is Howell allied to it? Let’s get to work. The group Stimson’s claim springs from debate in Stafford over which bathrooms should be used by a transgender fourth-grader at Hartwood Elementary School. The student, who identifies as a female, had been allowed to use the girls’ restroom. That drew opposition from a parents’ group called Save Our Schools, who said their daughters were being required to use a bathroom with a boy. The county school board held a public hearing on March 24 and most of the speakers, according to the Free Lance-Star in nearby Fredericksburg, opposed the student using the girls’ bathroom. Later in the meeting, the board unanimously voted that the student must instead use either a single stall restroom at the school, a staff bathroom or the boys’ restroom. What about the group that Stimpson says was ""pushing mixed sex bathrooms in Stafford County schools?"" Stimpson’s campaign told us she was referring to Equality Virginia, an advocacy organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transexual Virginians. Before the vote, Virginia Lambeck, Equality Virginia’s program director, emailed Stafford school board members, urging them to adopt a countywide policy that would allow transgender students to chose which bathrooms to use. Lambeck attached model policies drafted by the Gay Lesbian & Straight Education Network and the Massachusetts Department of Education. James Parrish, Equality Virginia’s executive director, emailed us that allowing transgender students to use the restrooms of their preference makes schools more welcoming to them. ""Transgender children, like all children, are balancing academic requirements with extracurricular activities and a social life, they are managing relationships with parents, teachers, and friends, and they are thinking about their future"" he wrote. ""Being stigmatized for who they are should not be part of any child’s growing up."" Now, let’s move on to the speaker. Is Howell ""allied"" with Equality Virginia? Stimpson’s campaign says Howell’s PAC -- Dominion Leadership Trust -- accepted $6,000 in contributions from Equality Virginia from 2006 through 2012 and that the speaker has supported the LGBT group on some key issues. Howell’s PAC did indeed receive $6,000 from the group during that span, according to records from the Virginia Public Access Project. It should be noted that Equality Virginia hasn’t given anything to the  speaker’s PAC since 2012. For perspective, Howell’s PAC collected almost $11.8 million from 2006 through 2014. Equality Virginia’s donations account for 1/20th of 1 percent of that sum. As for Howell’s voting record, Rollin Reisinger, Stimpson’s campaign manager emailed us that  ""Howell may not support everything on Equality Virginia's agenda, but he has been an ally on certain issues."" He cited two instances: In 2013, Howell voted to appoint an openly gay judge, Tracy Thorne-Begland, to the Richmond Manchester General District Court. Earlier this year, legislation that would have allowed the speaker to a hire a lawyer to defend a state constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and woman died in the House Rules Committee, which Howell chairs. Individual votes were not recorded. Howell supported a similar measure to protect the marriage amendment in 2014 when Attorney General Mark Herring, a Democrat, said he would not defend challenges to it.   Equality Virginia offers a different take on Howell. Its legislative scorecard says Howell opposed its agenda on six of eight issues in 2012 and 2013. Howell, for example: Voted for a successful bill that allows private adoption and foster agencies to bypass prospective LGBT parents on grounds of religious or moral convictions.. Voted against unsuccessful legislation that would have prevented LGBT children from being placed in foster homes where the parents believe that ""being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender is a behavior rather than an in-born, immutable characteristic."" We should note that Equality Virginia did not publish a House scorecard in 2014. That’s because almost all of the bills on its agenda were killed in committees and never reached the floor. The group faced the same results this year. ""Similar to previous years, despite all our hard work, it’s disappointing – but not surprising –  to see the House of Delegates stand in the way to creating a welcoming and inclusive Virginia,"" the group said in its 2015 legislative wrap-up. Parrish, the executive director of Equality Virginia, said his group used to give money to Howell’s PAC because it wanted to contribute to both political parties -- a strategy frequently used by special interests. The speaker, he added, has not responded with kindness. ""While it would be great to have support from the House leadership on our issues, Speaker Howell has not done anything to assist Equality Virginia with our legislative agenda of seeking fairness and equality for LGBT Virginians,"" Parrish said in a prepared statement. Matthew Moran, a spokesman for Howell, offered the same sentiment. ""Under (Howell’s) leadership, the House has defeated nearly every single one of Equality Virginia’s legislative priorities,"" he emailed. As for the transgender bathroom issue, Moran said Howell discussed the matter with Stafford school board members before the vote and ""supports their decision 100 percent.""  Our ruling Stimpson wrote ""BILL HOWELL is allied to group pushing MIXED SEX BATHROOMS in Stafford schools."" Equality Virginia unsuccessfully advocated allowing transgender students in Stafford to use the restrooms of their choice. Stimpson’s statement makes it sound like the LGBT group wanted a broad policy that would have allowed all students of either sex to use the same bathrooms. That’s not the case. When proposed, the debate focused on one fourth-grader at one school. The connection between Equality Virginia and Howell is equally tenuous. The group made annual donations totaling $6,000 to Howell’s multi-million dollar PAC from 2006 to 2012. What Stimpson omits is that Equality Virginia has not contributed to the PAC in more than two years. The group decided, well in advance of restroom issue, that Howell was unfriendly to LGBT issues and now says Howell ""has not done anything to assist"" it. So any small comity that once may have existed between the speaker and Equality Virginia is certainly dead",False,"April 6, 2015"
"""Florida has a law like (Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act).""","Likely presidential candidates have reacted to Indiana’s controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act as Gov. Mike Pence, a Republican, has had to defend the law against those who say it discriminates against gays and lesbians. Former Gov. Jeb Bush sided with Pence in a radio interview on Monday. ""I think Gov. Pence has done the right thing,"" Bush said in a radio interview with Hugh Hewitt on March 30. ""Florida has a law like this. Bill Clinton signed a law like this at the federal level. This is simply allowing people of faith space to be able to express their beliefs, to be able to be people of conscience. I just think once the facts are established, people aren’t going to see this as discriminatory at all."" How similar is the Florida law to the Indiana law, or the federal law before that? When we reached out to Bush’s office, they reiterated that Bush was describing the laws as ""very similar."" We decided to delve into the evidence for a complete picture. After federal law struck down, Florida’s law followed Today’s controversy goes back to 1993, when Clinton signed into law the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The law’s intent was to protect religious practices from government interference, such as whether a Muslim prison guard could wear a beard, or Native Americans could use peyote as part of the religious practices. In 1997, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the law didn’t apply to states, which kicked off a spree of about 19 states passing their own versions of the law. In 1998, a year before Bush took office, the Florida Legislature passed the Florida Religious Freedom Restoration Act with broad support and little media attention. Both the American Civil Liberties Union and the Christian Coalition backed it. It became law without Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles signature.  Florida’s law stated, ""the government shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion."" To be clear, it made no mention of same-sex marriage or gay rights. (Neither does the Indiana law.) At the time, state officials seemed most concerned about the protections they would have to provide prisoners. ""We had one prisoner who wanted conjugal visits because he said his religion commanded him to 'go forth and multiply,’ ""' said Marty Moore, deputy general counsel for Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth, to the Lakeland Ledger. Over the years, churches and ministers have used the law to argue that they shouldn’t be subject to zoning laws or other actions from local government. They haven’t found much success due to ""hostile judicial interpretation,"" said University of Virginia professor Douglas Laycock.   In one case, Temple B’Nai Zion in Sunny Isles Beach -- a city in Miami-Dade County -- used the Florida law to challenge a decision by the city to designate their 1964 building as historic. The temple’s owners said the designation would stifle expansion plans. The lawsuit was dismissed by a Miami federal judge but reinstated by a federal appeals court. In 2014, the temple and the city reached a settlement that kept the historic designation but allowed some expansion. Differences in text and context In 2015, the context for Indiana’s law is different. Courts have been striking down same-sex marriage bans, including in Indiana, and the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to weigh in on the constitutionality of the bans this year. When Pence signed Indiana’s law in a private ceremony, people who work for groups that oppose same-sex marriage were in attendance. One of the lobbyists, Eric Miller of Advance America, heralded the state’s law as protecting Christian bakers, florists and photographers from penalty ""for refusing to participate in a homosexual marriage, among other examples."" In addition to that context, there are differences in the texts of Florida’s 1998 law and Indiana’s recent law. Indiana’s law says the law can be used to protect religious freedom in private disputes, even if the government is not a party. Florida’s law has no such language. Here’s the Indiana text: ""A person whose exercise of religion has been substantially burdened, or is likely to be substantially burdened, by a violation of this chapter may assert the violation or impending violation as a claim or defense in a judicial or administrative proceeding, regardless of whether the state or any other governmental entity is a party to the proceeding."" Indiana’s law seems to be written to specifically cover a situation such as the New Mexico photographer who did not want to participate in a same-sex wedding, said Caroline Mala Corbin, a University of Miami constitutional law professor. The New Mexico Supreme Court ruled against the photographer. Indiana’s law follows the Supreme Court case about Hobby Lobby, in which the court ruled that the federal law protects family owned corporations from being forced to offer insurance that covers contraception under the health care law. Under Indiana’s law, a ""person"" is extended to mean ""a partnership, a limited liability company, a corporation, a company, a firm, a society, a joint-stock company, an unincorporated association"" or other entity. ""Unlike the federal and Florida RFRA (Religious Freedom Restoration Act), the Indiana one explicitly covers for-profit corporations,"" Corbin said. ""It’s still an open question as to whether Florida’s RFRA extends to any for-profit corporation."" University of Minnesota law professor Dale Carpenter pointed to two more differences between the laws in Florida and Indiana: • The Florida law specifically excludes claims made under the state's drug abuse prevention and control law (Chapter 893), which means you can’t get a religious exemption to drug laws in Florida. The Indiana law has no such limitation. •  The Florida law requires that a person's religious exercise must be burdened before a claim can be made. The Indiana law says that it need only to be ""likely to be substantially burdened."" Robin Fretwell Wilson, professor and director of the family law and policy program at the University of Illinois College of Law, said Florida and Indiana share something in common: Neither has a statewide ban against LGBT discrimination. Our ruling Speaking of the Indiana law, Bush said that Florida ""has a law like this."" Florida did pass its own version of the 1993 federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act. But the laws and the context for their passage are different. Indiana’s law says government doesn’t have to be a party to the case, and it extends protections to corporations, and that’s different from Florida’s law.  Bush's statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details",Half True,"March 31, 2015"
"Alabamians ""haven’t changed their opinion"" on same-sex marriage since voting to ban it in 2006.","CNN’s Chris Cuomo challenged Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore to defend a decision that will allow local courts to ignore a federal judge’s ruling striking down the state’s anti-gay marriage law. ""Times have changed as they did with slavery,"" Cuomo said Feb. 12 on New Day. ""The population no longer feels the same way. And even in your state, people no longer feel the same way."" Moore held firm that marriage was defined as between a man and a woman, and said, ""81 percent as recently as 2006 said it was the definition. They haven’t changed their opinion."" Support for gay marriage has increased nationwide significantly in just the last decade. According to the Pew Research Center, in 2006, 55 percent of Americans opposed gay marriage. By 2014, 52 percent supported marriage rights for same-sex couples, and opposition was down to 40 percent. But has there been no movement on the issue in Alabama, as Moore claimed? We decided to take a look. In June 2006, voters in Alabama overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment barring authorities from issuing marriage licenses to ""parties of the same sex."" The referendum passed with 81 percent of the vote. Moore’s office confirmed that was the number he was alluding to. What has happened since then? Being a solidly red state, and a rural one at that, Alabama is not surveyed as often as some other states. But here’s what we found from the polls that do exist. In 2012, a poll of likely voters by the Capital Survey Research Center — an arm of the Alabama Education Association and one of the most consistent pollsters in the state until it recently closed — found 71 percent opposed same-sex marriage. Likely voters would be those most expected to show up for an off-year primary election, as was the case when the referendum passed in 2006. So by that measure, while gay marriage remains deeply unpopular in the state, there was a 10 percentage point decrease in opposition. That drop in Alabama is largely in line with the slope of the decline in opposition at the national level. During the same time frame, nationwide opposition to gay marriage fell to 46 percent in 2012 from 55 percent in 2006, according to Pew. It’s not a perfect comparison to look at the 2006 Alabama referendum, which asked people to vote on a constitutional ban on gay marriage, and a 2012 survey that queried voters on whether they support gay marriage. For example, some people might have opposed gay marriage but didn’t think a constitutional amendment was necessary. But it’s a measurable change in sentiment on the overall topic that is backed up by other research. In 2005, 87 percent of registered voters told the Capital Survey Research Center that they supported the position of, ""Allowing only traditional marriage between a man and a woman."" But an Alabama television station found in 2015 that 70 percent of registered voters oppose gay marriage. Finally, the Williams Institute at UCLA estimated marriage opinions for every state in 2004 and 2012 based on each state’s demographics in those years. How was this accomplished? They took the demographic make-up (age, religion, race, etc.) of each state and compared it against national survey data that broke down sentiments about marriage by those demographics. Researchers took this approach because lack of polling data in many states made it difficult to spot trends. What they found was support for gay marriage in Alabama grew from 16 percent in 2004 to 32 percent in 2012. Alabama’s increase of 16 percentage points was actually larger than the national average (13.5 percentage point increase), though the starting point there was much, much lower than most states. And that’s an important point to note: Alabama was among the states with the lowest support for gay marriage in 2004 and it remains among the lowest today. By the Williams Institute’s estimate, only Arkansas and Louisiana have a fewer percentage of citizens supportive of gay marriage (31 percent). That result is echoed by the Public Religion Research Institute, which found that Alabama and Mississippi in 2014 had the lowest support for same-sex marriage among their populations at 32 percent. Our ruling Moore said since voters passed a constitutional amendment barring same-sex marriage in 2006, Alabamians ""haven’t changed their opinion."" An overwhelming number of people still oppose same-sex marriage in Alabama, and it remains one of the least-supportive states of gay marriage, according to the information available. But polling data suggests measurable movement on this issue. In 2006, 81 percent of voters supported the referendum to prohibit gay marriage in Alabama. Recent polls show about 71 percent of likely voters oppose same-sex marriage today. That’s in line with other data that show growing support for same-sex marriage in the last decade there, and is similar to the rate of decline in opposition nationally",Half True,"February 13, 2015"
"The religious liberty bill proposed in the Georgia House of Representatives does not specifically exclude corporations, which means they can legally claim a religious exemption.","As a proposed religious liberty bill begins to pick up steam in the new legislative session, so, too, does the controversy over just what the measure does. Opponents scuttled a proposal last year over concerns that it would effectively legalize discrimination against gays and other minority groups. State Rep. Sam Teasley, R-Marietta, retooled the proposal as House Bill 29 this year and said his intent is a law that prevents government from intruding on people’s faith-based beliefs. But the head of a gay advocacy group recently said the latest proposal would still allow private businesses to discriminate against customers by citing religious beliefs. ""It is my certainly my understanding that if corporations are not specifically excluded under state law, then corporations could still claim a religious exemption,"" Georgia Equality Executive Director Jeff Graham said in an interview with WABE radio. The question gets into the details of legal minutiae, which is right up PolitiFact Georgia’s alley. So we decided to check: Does existing law require corporations to be specifically exempted for it not to apply to them? Reaching out to legal scholars from across the political spectrum, we found a rare agreement. Without that exemption, businesses can claim a religious exemption. Why? Think back to Mitt Romney being mocked for telling a heckler at the Iowa State Fair that ""corporations are people, my friend."" Legally, Romney is mostly right. In legal terms, corporations have had some of the same rights as you and I since the early 1800s. Those rights that allow government to regulate businesses much the same way it legislates some human actions, said Anne Tucker, a law professor at Georgia State University who specializes in business and corporate law. Corporations went on to gain the right to make political expenditures with the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission in 2010. Then, the Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores ruling last year affirmed that some for-private businesses also have religious rights. The basis for that ruling: the 1993 federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act. On top of that, Georgia code also clearly defines a person as ""an individual, a corporation, a partnership, a business trust, an association, a firm, or any other legal entity."" Combined, that creates the opportunity for all sorts of businesses – not just the ""closely held"" firms listed in the Hobby Lobby ruling – to potentially discriminate based on religious claims, legal experts said. To opponents, the mere opportunity is of concern in Georgia, which like the federal government does not ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. ""Notwithstanding the guarantees of the author, and his intentions to limit it to state action, we have some reason to be concerned, because in the past those limitations haven’t been enough to protect people from discrimination in Georgia,"" said Tanya Washington, a law professor at Georgia State University whose amicus brief was cited in the Supreme Court’s ruling to overturn the federal Defense of Marriage Act. Supporters of the measure, though, argue that the exemption should remain so that Georgia falls in line with existing Supreme Court rulings. ""They may not like it, but the fact is, that is what the law is,"" said Mathew Staver, founder of the conservative Liberty Counsel and law professor at Liberty University. ""I think it makes sense to have corporations, which are legal persons, have First Amendment protections for free exercise of religion just like they’ve had free speech rights in the past."" That controversy has proved distracting – and fatal to other proposed religious liberty bills in Georgia and elsewhere, such as Arizona. The AJC Legislative Navigator gives this year’s bill a 13 percent chance of passing in its current state. Mark Goldfeder, a law professor at Emory University who also is the senior fellow at the Center for the Study of Law and Religion, said there is an easy fix. The bill could be amended to define a person as only a ""natural person or religious organization,"" meaning only specific organizations, churches, temples and the like. Teasley plans to do just that. He told PolitiFact Georgia that he had heard of the claim about corporations being able to claim the exemption and put the question to legislative counsel. Like the outside scholars, the attorney for the Legislature agreed the measure would extend to businesses. Teasley said he plans to add the term ""natural person"" to the bill in a bid to achieve his original objective: Stop government overreach on an individual’s right to religious conscience. He said he plans that change in the next week. ""This should not be a controversial bill,"" Teasley said. ""This kind of thing used to bring Democrats and Republicans, conservatives and liberals together, and I hope it can again."" That’s a fact check for a different day. But in the world of politics and religion, we have found the equivalent of a leprechaun riding a unicorn across a field of four-leaf clovers: complete consensus. The claim was whether the bill, as drafted, would allow businesses to claim religious exemptions",True,"January 21, 2015"
"""Supreme Court 15 times over the last 120 years has said marriage is a fundamental right"" and never said ""it had to be between a man and a woman.""","With the U.S. Supreme Court poised to decide whether same-sex marriage must be legal in all 50 states, Fox News Sunday pitted Family Research Council president Tony Perkins against former solicitor general Ted Olson for a Jan. 18 roundtable debate. There isn’t precedent for the Supreme Court justices to limit marriages to heterosexual couples only, said Olson, a Republican attorney who supports same-sex marriage and has argued 61 cases in front of the Supreme Court. ""The United States Supreme Court 15 times over the last 120 years has said that ‘marriage is a fundamental right,’"" Olson said. Perkins, a fervent opponent of same-sex marriage, interrupted: ""Marriage, but not same-sex marriage."" Olson continued, ""Never once in any of those cases did it say that it had to be between a man and a woman. Fifteen times it said it was a matter of privacy, liberty, association, dignity and respect for the individual."" We wondered about these 15 cases and if they really don’t define marriage as solely between a man and a woman. Olson pointed us to a brief he and his colleagues filed as the respondents in the 2013 case Hollingsworth vs. Perry, which the Supreme Court declined to hear, effectively sustaining a lower court decision to allow same-sex marriages in California. The brief says the Supreme Court has said marriage is a ""fundamental right"" in ""more than a dozen"" cases. ""In fact, this Court has characterized the right to marry as one of the most fundamental rights — if not the most fundamental right — of an individual,"" the brief said of Loving vs. Virginia, in which the Supreme Court approved interracial marriage. The cases he cited cover a range of topics, including privacy and parental and reproductive rights, but all touch on marriage as a ""fundamental right"" in some way. Here are the cases cited in the brief in chronological order: Maynard vs. Hill (1888) Meyer vs. Nebraska (1923) Skinner vs. Oklahoma ex. rel. Williamson (1942) Griswold vs. Connecticut (1965) Loving vs. Virginia (1967) Boddie vs. Connecticut (1971) Roe vs. Wade (1973) Cleveland Board of Education vs. LaFleur (1974) Carey vs. Population Services International (1977) Moore vs. City of East Cleveland (1977) Zablocki vs. Redhail (1978) Turner vs. Safley (1987) Planned Parenthood of Southeast Pennsylvania vs. Casey (1992) M.L.B. vs. S.L.J. (1996) Lawrence vs. Texas (2003) (They’re also listed with more detail in this blog post by the American Foundation for Equal Rights, a marriage equality advocacy group.) Outside legal experts reviewed the cases for us and said they support Olson’s claim that the Supreme Court has generally not addressed whether marriage is confined to heterosexual couples. The experts also said there are likely more than just 15 examples. ""The question was never asked,"" said Clifford Rosky, a law professor at the University of Utah. ""(Olson’s) correct to say that they’ve never specifically said marriage is just a man and a woman."" That is, until the Supreme Court’s 2013 decision to strike down part of the Defense of Marriage Act, ensuring same-sex couples get the same federal benefits as heterosexual couples. In this case, Rosky said, the court had to address the definition of marriage and said homosexual couples can be considered married. Until recent decades, some experts told us, the court likely assumed that when they said ""marriage,"" others would interpret that as meaning a heterosexual union, not a homosexual one, due to societal norms. ""Not a single one of these cases (in Olson’s list) would have been assuming anything but opposite-sex marriage,"" said Michael Klarman, a constitutional law professor at Harvard University. ""Before the 1990s, virtually nobody took the idea of same-sex marriage seriously."" In the 1960s, states began revising their laws to have more gender-neutral language, which raised questions about whether marriages should be extended to same-sex marriages if statutes do not specify otherwise, said Martha Umphrey, a professor of American government at Amherst College. Rogers Smith, an expert on constitutional law at the University of Pennsylvania, said other Supreme Court decisions show the tendency of justices to assume marriage means a heterosexual relationship. For example, they have sometimes linked the right to marry with the right to bear children. And in the 1961 case Poe vs. Ullman, Justice John Harlan argued that ""although the right to privacy protected rights of marital couples, it did not protect rights of homosexuals."" Perkins’ Family Research Council, says the fact that the Supreme Court has tied the ""right to marry"" to procreation is proof that this right only applies to opposite sex couples. Smith added that the examples in Olson’s list up to the 1960s tend to link marriage to the survival of the species and family life. But over time, the justices started to discuss the right to marry more as a right of all individuals and essential to human dignity and happiness. He said this reflects changing norms and makes denying same-sex couples the right to marry seem much more unreasonable than it would have in years past. Umphrey compared the current debate to that of interracial marriage. Until the years leading up to the Supreme Court’s 1967 decision that interracial marriages should be legal, most people -- including the justices -- assumed marriage meant a union between two people of the same race. Still, the Supreme Court used its own prior comments on marriage as a ""fundamental right"" as precedent for its decision. Our ruling Olson said, the ""Supreme Court 15 times over the last 120 years has said marriage is a fundamental right"" and never said ""it had to be between a man and a woman."" Olson provided a list of 15 cases that addressed marriage as something like a ""fundamental right"" that did not specify marriage as a union between a man and woman. Several experts backed up his claim. Until recent years, though, the Supreme Court never had to address the question of whether or not marriage should be limited to a man and woman. Because of societal norms, they assumed that the decision would be interpreted as referring to a heterosexual relationship. Still, Olson’s claim is on point",True,"January 18, 2015"
"Polls on legalizing same-sex marriage ""are not dramatically changing.""","Julaine Appling thinks advocates of same-sex marriage should put the issue to another statewide referendum if they’re so confident public opinion has shifted to their side. ""They argue all the time, ‘the polls are changing,’ "" Appling said to guest host Mike Siegel on the Charlie Sykes show on WTMJ-AM (620) on Jan. 6, 2015. ""Well, the truth is, the polls are not dramatically changing."" Appling was a key figure in the 2006 passage of a statewide referendum that effectively banned same-sex marriage in Wisconsin until a decision by U.S. District Court Judge Barbara Crabb in June 2014. Appling leads Wisconsin Family Council and Wisconsin Family Action, which describe themselves as advocating for Judeo-Christian values. In that 2006 referendum, 59 percent of voters in the fall general election endorsed rewriting the state constitution in a way that legally recognizes marriage only as ""between one man and one woman."" The referendum language also prohibited the state from recognizing ""a legal status identical or substantially similar to that of marriage for unmarried individuals."" The U.S. Supreme Court in October 2014 rejected appeals from Wisconsin and four other states seeking to preserve their same-sex marriage bans. Nationally, it’s well documented that attitudes toward gay marriage have become more much more accepting in recent years. Thirty-six states have legalized gay marriage. But what about in Wisconsin? Asked to provide backup for her claim of no dramatic change, Appling pointed in part to two polls from 2014. Neither, however, broke out any Wisconsin data. One surveyed only Republicans or GOP-leaning independents and found large majorities favoring a traditional definition of marriage. The other was from surveys of people as they exited polling places across the country; it showed voters evenly split on gay marriage nationally. But Appling cited public opinion in Wisconsin, not nationwide. She did point us to a Wisconsin statewide poll conducted by St. Norbert College in 2014 -- but it doesn’t entirely back her point. It found a slim majority (52 percent) in favor of the 2006 amendment’s language regarding marriage for ""one man"" and ""one woman."" Remember, it passed with 59 percent support, so that’s a substantial drop. When we looked ourselves, we found a fairly small number of Wisconsin polls that were on point, but they document relatively large changes in opinion. The St. Norbert ""Wisconsin Survey"" sampled opinion on the ""one man-one woman"" language even before the referendum went to voters, and has continued to do so. From that poll, here are the percentages in favor of the ""one man-one woman"" approach advocated 2006 referendum. Spring 2004: 66 percent Spring 2006: 61 percent Spring 2012: 56 percent Spring 2014: 52 percent. So, while a bare majority in this survey still backed the traditional view, support for it has fallen 14 percentage points in a decade. Other polls The Marquette University Law School Poll tested the issue three times in 2014, and its findings were at odds with the St. Norbert poll. That poll found between 55 percent and 64 percent support for ""allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally."" The portion against legal marriage for such couples ranged in size from 30 percent to 37 percent. That suggests an even bigger change in opinion and suggests a reversal from the 2006 referendum vote. Such comparisons are imperfect, though, due to factors such as the unpredictability of who shows up to vote and the impact of the wording of survey questions. The MU Law Poll was launched just three years ago, so it does not have a long history on this question. But we found a couple other sources. In an August 2011 poll,  Public Policy Polling, a Democratic-leaning firm, found exactly half of respondents thought same-sex marriage should be illegal, with 39 percent saying legal. By spring 2014, the firm for the first time found more in favor of legalizing than against: 47 to 45 percent, though the two-point gap is smaller than the poll’s margin of error. Exit polls provide more evidence. Surveys taken in November 2014 as voters left polling places asked if Wisconsin should legally recognize same-sex marriage. Yes, said 52 percent. No, said 45 percent. One more finding before we close. Pollsters sometimes throw in other options when asking about how to handle the marriage question. They will ask respondents what is closer to their own view: legalizing same-sex marriage, giving civil recognition to such unions, or giving no legal recognition to them. These results also show major changes in opinion, though support for same-sex marriage comes in lower. In 2009, the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, a conservative think tank, found 27 percent support for same-sex marriage, 32 percent for civil unions but not same-sex marriage, and 35 percent for no legal recognition. In May 2014, five years later, the Marquette poll posed the same question using the exact same language. It found 49 percent support for same-sex marriage, 25 percent for civil unions and 19 percent for no recognition. That’s a change of 22 points for same-sex marriage. Our rating In saying a do-over of the state’s 2006 referendum legalizing only opposite-sex marriages would again pass, Appling said public opinion polls on gay marriage ""are not dramatically changing."" Her remarks were squarely in a Wisconsin context, and surveys here have shown major change in favor of legalizing same-sex marriages",False,"January 16, 2015"
"Says Jeb Bush ""not only opposes marriage equality, he’s said he ‘personally’ believes gay couples should be banned from adopting children.""","When former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush announced he was exploring a bid to run for president, the Democrats let loose their opposition research. The Democratic National Committee released talking points it wanted Democrats to use against Bush; Politico published a leaked copy on Dec. 19. Bush then posted the talking points on his own Facebook page, denouncing the attacks as ""silly"" and ""misleading."" The DNC attacked Bush’s statements and positions on a long list of topics, saying that another Bush presidency would mean policies ""that wreck the economy, that give massive breaks to the wealthy and corporations, and that are out of step with American people including women, LGBT Americans, Latinos and people of color. The reality is that Jeb Bush is no different than almost all Republicans on issue after issue."" Among the talking points was this one: ""Bush not only opposes marriage equality, he’s said he ‘personally’ believes gay couples should be banned from adopting children."" The timing of that particular attack caught our eye, because in recent months plaintiffs have filed lawsuits to overturn Florida’s gay marriage ban, which voters approved in 2008. Federal Judge Robert Hinkle ruled in August that the ban is unconstitutional, but he stayed his order to allow for appeals. After the U.S. Supreme Court rejected requests to extend the stay, Hinkle told county clerks they will be violating the U.S. Constitution if they don’t issue same sex marriage licenses on Jan. 6. A Miami-Dade judge allowed gay marriages to proceed in that county Jan. 5. Here, we’ll look at whether the DNC was accurate in saying that Bush opposes same-sex marriage and believes gay couples should be banned from adopting children. Same-sex marriage While in office from 1999 to 2007, Bush consistently opposed gay marriage, though he was not a leading crusader against it. In 2004, Bush’s brother President George W. Bush proposed an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to ban gay marriages. At the time, Florida law did not allow for same-sex marriage, though there was no specific ban on it in the state Constitution. In 2004, 11 states approved their own gay marriage bans. A spokeswoman for the DNC pointed to an article in the Tallahassee Democrat that stated: ""Bush supports his brother, President George W. Bush, in seeking a constitutional amendment to define marriage as a union of one man and one woman."" Over the next few years, religious conservatives in Florida worked to get a question on the ballot banning gay marriage in the state constitution, and they succeeded in 2008. Bush faced questions about it while in office. At times, he showed some support with caveats for a state constitutional ban, but he also often said that he was reluctant to change the Constitution. ""If there was a threat that gay marriage would be accepted in our state, then I might be supportive of it,"" Bush said in November 2004, according to the Orlando Sentinel. ""I'm not sure it's necessary to do this in a pre-emptive fashion."" It’s worth noting that when Bush was in office, he had plenty of company among both Republicans and Democrats in opposing gay marriage. It wasn’t until May 2012 that President Barack Obama made a Full Flop in favor of gay marriage. And it wasn’t until March 2013 that Hillary Clinton announced she now supported gay marriage. That same month Bill Clinton denounced the Defense of Marriage Act that he had signed in 1996. Gay adoption In 2001, a federal judge upheld Florida’s ban on gay adults adopting. The state argued that married heterosexuals provided a more stable home (even though the state allowed single people to adopt). Bush supported that ruling. As Bush faced re-election in 2002, the ban remained a hot topic as a challenge winded its way through federal appeals court. Bush said he was reluctant to take a stand since the issue was in court. ""I think it's an issue that is marginal to the bigger issue, which is, how do we get children in loving homes?"" Bush said. Bush’s position on gays adopting came up during an October 2002 debate when he faced re-election against Democratic rival Bill McBride. ""If you're going to have permanency, it should be with a loving couple that is a man and a wife. That is the law of this land, it's in the courts, but I also believe that personally,"" Bush said. A poll done for the Orlando Sentinel during that race showed that a majority of Floridians at the time opposed gays adopting and same-sex marriages. In January 2004, a federal appeals court upheld the ban. ""The decision validates Florida's conclusion that it is in the best interest of adopted children, many of whom come from troubled and unstable backgrounds, to be placed in a home anchored both by a father and a mother,"" Bush said in a news release. In 2010, a state appeals court struck down the ban. Bush’s comments since he left office Bush has made a few statements since he left office defending ""traditional marriage"" but has said little about gays adopting. In an interview with CBS’ Charlie Rose in 2012, he seemed to express some tolerance for gay parents and used softer language to talk about gay couples. ""I think traditional marriage is what should be sanctioned and not at the expense of discriminating in other forms of family structure."" Bush said. ""So I don’t support it, but I would say that wholesome loving family life ought to be kind of the organizing principle in a free society. If we don’t want to have government overwhelm us, then we have to be self-governing. ... And if people love their children with all their heart and soul, and that’s what they do, and that’s how they organized their life, that should be held up as examples for others to follow, because we need it. We desperately need it, and that can take all sorts of forms. It doesn’t have to take the one that I think should be sanctioned under the law."" In a statement to reporters at an event at Mississippi College in March 2013, he said the U.S. Supreme Court should not decide the issue: ""I am a supporter of traditional marriage. I do think that these decisions should be made at the state level, so I hope the constitutional amendment in California is not overturned."" (He made his comments a few months before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal Defense of Marriage Act and dismissed a case on Proposition 8, California’s law that banned gay marriage.) Bush told the Miami Herald on Jan. 4 in a brief interview, ""It ought to be a local decision. I mean, a state decision. The state decided. The people of the state decided. But it’s been overturned by the courts, I guess."" We asked a spokeswoman for Bush about his stance on gay adults adopting and marrying. Initially, we did not get a reply. But soon after we published this report, a spokesperson sent us two comments from Bush. On gay couples adopting: ""Previously, I opposed gay adoption, but it has since become the law in our state, and I respect that decision."" On same-sex marriage: ""We live in a democracy, and regardless of our disagreements, we have to respect the rule of law. I hope that we can also show respect for the good people on all sides of the gay and lesbian marriage issue – including couples making lifetime commitments to each other who are seeking greater legal protections and those of us who believe marriage is a sacrament and want to safeguard religious liberty."" Our ruling The DNC said that ""Bush not only opposes marriage equality, he’s said he ‘personally’ believes gay couples should be banned from adopting children."" As Bush continues to explore running for president, he may provide more specific comments about his current views, but for now we are rating the DNC’s statement based on the evidence that was available at the time they made the statement. While in office, Bush repeatedly said that he opposed gay marriage, although he was reluctant at times to amend the state Constitution since it was already banned in state law. He also opposed gay adults adopting children. Since leaving office, Bush said that he supports ""traditional marriage,"" though he has used a softer tone when asked about it, and did so again when we asked about it",Mostly True,"January 5, 2015"
"""Fox News uses photo of a married couple promoting ‘traditional marriage’ and the photo is actually of a same-sex couple.""","No meme should ever be taken at face value, so when a reader asked us to look at one that slammed Fox News, we read it with a skeptical eye.  The meme shows two women -- one in a bridal gown and the other in a suit -- kissing. It reads, ""That special moment when Foxnews.com uses a photo of a married couple promoting ‘traditional marriage’ and the photo is actually of a same-sex couple."" There are two key elements to check. Did the Fox News website use this image at all, and did it appear in the context of an article that favored hetereosexual marriage? And we suppose you could ask if the people in the photo above are both women. That last one is easy. Yes. The picture was taken on Valentine’s Day 2012 by an Associated Press photographer. This was the first same-sex couple to be married at the Empire State Building. So did the photo (not the snarky words of course) appear on Foxnews.com? Fox News said it had. Through a spokeswoman, Jeff Misenti, Fox’s chief digital officer, said that when the photo was pointed out to Fox, they pulled it and replaced it with one that fit the context of the article it accompanied. The image also showed up on a segment of Fox and Friends. Cue Google So who tipped off Fox? Google conveniently includes a feature to spot all the occurrences of a particular image. Through that, we found a blog post from Feb. 6, 2013, by Jessica Valenti, a columnist with the Guardian. Valenti is credited by other bloggers for being the first to spot Fox’s faux pas. Valenti wrote, ""Shhhh … no one tell Fox News that the ‘wedding kiss’ picture they’re using to accompany a piece about traditional gender roles is actually of a same sex couple."" Valenti told PunditFact it seemed pretty obvious to her that the picture was of two women. She recognized that it was shot atop the Empire State Building and did her own image search to find the original. Valenti included the image of the couple kissing in her post, but there was no logo or other sign that it had appeared on Foxnews.com. And Valenti updated her post to say, ""Fox News has taken the image down :( "" But Valenti’s item inspired much repetition in the blogosphere, and Gawker’s post had a complete screenshot. Traditional marriage It’s safe to say that when people talk about traditional marriage, they mean heterosexual couples. The article on Fox’s website that included the photo did not directly say that opposite-sex marriages were superior to same-sex unions. It simply did not make the comparison. However, it did target the values it saw as being thrust upon American women. Society, said the writer Suzanne Venker, ""eschews marriage."" Women have ""been taught instead to honor sex, singlehood and female empowerment,"" Venker wrote. Venker advocated a code that struck a definite chord of traditionalism. It was based on accepting the validity of norms from times gone by. ""Prior to the 1970s, people viewed gender roles as as (sic) equally valuable,"" Venker wrote. ""Many would argue women had the better end of the deal! It’s hard to claim women were oppressed in a nation in which men were expected to stand up when a lady enters the room or to lay down their lives to spare a woman’s life."" Venker also happens to be the niece of Phyllis Schlafly, a long-time social conservative activist who opposes same-sex marriage. The two co-wrote a book attacking feminism. It is fair to characterize Venker’s article on Fox as supporting traditional marriage. Our ruling A Facebook meme said Fox News used a photo of a same-sex couple in an article that promoted traditional marriage. Fox News agrees that it used the photo and the story presented a case for marriage based on men and women adopting traditional gender roles",True,"November 21, 2014"
"""We know from the social science that children do best with a mom and a dad.""","The Supreme Court’s refusal this week to review any of the same-sex marriage cases that had been sent for appeal undercut such bans in several states. Supporters of gay marriage celebrated the move. Opponents criticized it as further proof that ""unelected judges"" have the power to overrule the will of the majority. Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a leading group in the fight against gay marriage, said children’s welfare is central to the council’s position. ""We know from the social science that children do best with a mom and a dad,"" Perkins said Oct. 12 on Fox News Sunday. We have examined this sort of claim before. The independent research fails to back up Perkins’ view. The Family Research Council has a Web page with 10 arguments from social science against same-sex marriage. We went through the list to see which spoke to the welfare of children, and of those points, which were based on studies that compared children in same-sex and opposite-sex households. Not addressing the welfare of children Five of the 10 had more to do with marriage and society than children. They advanced claims that opposite-sex marriage promotes the domestication of men, paternal commitment, sexual fidelity, ""gender-typical"" roles and the association of marriage with procreation. A sixth one spoke of how children conceived through artificial insemination ""hunger"" to know about their biological fathers. While those questions no doubt occur, the book cited by the Family Research Council focused largely on what fathers can bring to child-rearing. It was more a guide to fathering, and less a comparison study of different kinds of households. In fact, it wasn’t a peer-reviewed comparison study at all. The remaining four pieces of evidence That leaves four items on the Family Research Council list. One asserted that children need fathers and cited a study on households where the father is absent. However, that research looked at single-parent households, not children with same-sex parents, and so it addresses a different issue entirely. The Web page offers the corollary point that children need mothers. It cites books, not academic studies, and again, the books are not focused on comparing same-sex and opposite-sex households. They look at gender differences and how children develop over time. The final two points from the Family Research Council address the data on children of same-sex households. You can find many research papers that claim that growing up in same-sex households does no harm. But the council cited the court affidavit of a University of Virginia professor who said that not one of those studies ""was conducted according to generally accepted standards of scientific research."" That testimony has been critiqued on two scores: It came in 2001 and research has passed it by, and it overlooked a range of studies. But even if the methodological critique were correct, it wouldn’t prove that growing up in an opposite-sex household is better. The council then cited the work of New York University sociologist Judith Stacey to make the point that children raised in same-sex households ""are more likely to experience gender and sexual disorders."" When we looked at this topic before, Stacey said this represents a ""complete misuse of the research."" Stacey wrote that the differences she described, such as children being more open to same-sex relationships, need not be seen as deficits. Stacey accused same-sex marriage opponents of cherry-picking her findings. What other research shows We did find one study funded by conservative organizations as showing gay parents are worse than straight ones, but it was denounced by the American Sociological Association, the researcher’s own university and many reputable sociologists. In conducting the study, the researcher loosely defined same-sex couples and, in doing so, only spoke with two children who were actually raised by gay parents. In contrast, we found several research projects that compared much larger numbers of children in same and opposite-sex households. One published in 2012 looked at 78 children -- about half boys and half girls -- raised by lesbian parents. The mothers joined the research project as far back as 1986, long before their children were born. The children were assessed over time and those results were matched to children from heterosexual couples. When asked about how they felt about themselves, their relations with their parents and with their peers, the children of lesbians responded much as did the children of straight parents. However, they were more likely to report being teased at school because of their parents. The American Psychological Association produced a comprehensive review of studies going back three decades. The most relevant section focuses on research that compares the children of lesbian or gay parents. The studies looked at children in terms of their school performance, their relations with their peers, intelligence, self-esteem and a number of other variables. According to this review, ""the belief that children of lesbian and gay parents suffer deficits in personal development has no empirical foundation."" Our ruling Perkins said that based on social science, we know ""that children do best with a mom and a dad."" The research cited on the website of Perkins’ group, the Family Research Council, does not provide any support.

"""We know how to stop AIDS: persuade men not to have sex with men.""","Some of the 298 passengers who died aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 were HIV/AIDS researchers and advocates headed for the 20th International AIDS Conference in Australia, a fact President Barack Obama mentioned after the plane was shot down over eastern Ukraine. Obama also said in July 18 comments about the crash that ""the United States of America is going to continue to stand for the basic principle that people have the right to live as they choose."" That touched a nerve with Bryan Fischer, director of issues analysis of the conservative American Family Association. Fischer claimed that Obama was using the MH 17 downing as a platform to legitimize gay relationships. ""Obama politicizes deaths of AIDS researchers on Malaysian plane. We know how to stop AIDS: persuade men not to have sex with men,"" Fischer said in a message on Twitter that was retweeted 66 times and attracted national attention.  His comments were lambasted by writers of The Daily Beast, Salon and Patheos. Still, Fischer doubled down in another tweet and column. We wanted to dig into the facts behind his claim that the way to stop AIDS is to ""persuade men not to have sex with men."" Fischer’s evidence Experts say Fischer’s idea of an AIDS solution is highly flawed. But Fischer stood by his claim in an interview with PunditFact, citing a report from UNAIDS that the rate of HIV is 19 times higher among men who have sex with men than the adult population. Also, he said that while his tweet isolated on men having sex with men, he made a somewhat broader argument on his radio show.  ""We know how to stop the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Persuade men not to have sex with men,"" he said on his radio show Focal Point. ""Persuade prostitutes to go straight, and persuade people not to shoot up with drugs. If we can get everybody persuaded to do that, then the epidemic begins to diminish overnight."" Dr. Stefan Baral, a Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health epidemiology professor and director of the Key Populations Program of the Center for Public Health and Human Rights, said Fischer’s post on Twitter reveals a misunderstanding about human nature and societal behavior. ""His recommendation is akin to making recommendations for people not to drive cars for fear of car accidents or riding a bike for fear of falling,"" Baral said in an email. ""In other words, this is a natural and healthy normal practice that in the context of an additional determinant induces risk. It would not be dissimilar from saying that there would be no cervical cancer if heterosexual people didn’t have sex."" HIV/AIDS overview There is no cure for AIDS or HIV, the virus that leads to AIDS and ravages the body’s immune system if untreated. The statistics are staggering. About 35 million people have HIV in the world, including about 3.3 million children and 1 million Americans, according to the Foundation for AIDS Research, or amfAR. Among Americans, about 50,000 are newly infected each year, and 18 percent do not know they have the virus. In 2012, 1.6 million people died from AIDS, which was a 30 percent drop from 2005, according to UNAIDS. In the United States, gay men contract the virus at disproportionate rates to their share of the American population. In 2010, men who have sex with men comprised 78 percent of new HIV infections among men -- 63 percent of all new infections -- even though they made up just 4 percent of the male American population, according to the CDC. Still, preventing men from having sex with men (if that were even feasible) will not end HIV/AIDS in the United States. About 20 percent of Americans infected with HIV in 2010 were women, mainly through heterosexual sex, according to the CDC. HIV is carried through body fluids. The virus is passed when HIV-infected fluids enter the bloodstream of someone else, such as through contact with a cut or sore, sharing needles or syringes, or through the vagina, rectum, mouth, or tip of the penis. In the United States, anal sex is the highest-risk behavior for spreading HIV, followed by vaginal sex, sex with multiple partners and sharing needles with someone infected with HIV. Mother-to-child transmissions are not common in the United States thanks to widespread HIV testing of pregnant women and drugs that prevent the virus from affecting a child. Neither is getting the virus through blood transfusions and organ donations and transplants, which are intensely tested for HIV. But what’s true for Americans is not true for other people in the world. World picture About 70 percent of all people infected with HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa, about 24 million people. This region is also home to the most children living with HIV whose infections originated during pregnancy, childbirth of consuming breast milk, according to AIDS.gov. Globally, the dominant form of transmission is heterosexual sex, said Sophie Barton Knott, UNAIDS spokeswoman. Nearly half of people with HIV are female, and most were infected through heterosexual sex. Most of the 50.9 percent of men with HIV got it through heterosexual sex, too, she said. The highest rates of AIDS among 15- to 24-year-olds is among women in many parts of the world, said Seth Faison, spokesman for The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. And in Eastern Europe, the highest transmission rates of AIDS are among people who inject drugs. ""Men who have sex with men are a high-risk group, but not the only one,"" he said. The bottom line? Preventing men from having sex with men will not end AIDS. Faison said the criminalization of same-sex activity actually can increase transmission rates. Being gay is a crime in at least 76 countries, and in those places, gay men are less likely to receive treatment, testing and prevention. The CDC also says stigma and homophobia are likely one factor behind the rise in HIV infections among young gay men in the United States. ""In effect, efforts to ‘persuade men not to have sex with men’ is counterproductive,"" Faison said. ""It will not stop AIDS."" Our ruling Fischer said, ""We know how to stop AIDS: persuade men not to have sex with men."" Though men who have sex with men are at the highest risk of contracting HIV/AIDS in America, this is not a serious solution to ending a pandemic disease. Not in the United States, and certainly not worldwide. Women, children, and men who don’t have sex with men are also at risk, and women make up about half of people worldwide who have HIV/AIDS. Fischer’s claim is ridiculous",False Pants on Fire,"July 30, 2014"
"""Having an active father makes children 98 percent more likely to graduate from college.""","In defending traditional marriage, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said in a speech about values at Catholic University that fathers play a vital role in their children’s success. Rubio cited statistics about the number of children born to unwed mothers and what that means for their chances to climb out of poverty and go to college. After getting an education, finding a good job and getting married, ""The final element of the success sequence is raising children in a married, two-parent home,"" Rubio said July 23, 2014. ""Even in my own family, of course, I have examples of children raised by one parent who have gone on to successful lives. But we also know that having an active father makes children 98 percent more likely to graduate from college and complete the first step of the success sequence."" We decided to fact-check the 98 percent statistic. Study of teenagers A spokeswoman for Rubio pointed to a research brief about the role of fathers in college success by Bradford Wilcox, a sociologist and director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia. The brief was published by the conservative American Enterprise Institute where Wilcox is a visiting scholar. Wilcox used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, a respected study of a representative sample of teenagers in grades 7–12 during the 1994–95 school year. The survey asked teenagers 11 questions about activities they did with their dads -- for example, whether they received homework help from them. He found that by looking at the answers, Wilcox categorized 18 percent as having fathers who were not involved. For the remainder, he divided the fathers into three groups: somewhat involved, involved, or highly involved fathers. ""Compared to teens who reported that their fathers were not involved, teens with involved fathers were 98 percent more likely to graduate from college...,"" Wilcox wrote. Wilcox also found that involved fathers played more of a role in their children completing college if those children had mothers who completed at least high school or college. He found that only 15 percent of teens with a high-school educated mom and an uninvolved dad graduated from college, compared to 30 percent of teens with an involved dad and a high-school educated mom. Wilcox’s research wasn’t exclusively about married, biological or straight fathers; it looked at all fathers regardless of their marital status or if they lived with their children or sexual orientation. However Wilcox found that, ""adolescents are much more likely to report an involved or highly involved father if their biological parents are married."" Other experts weigh in We interviewed seven experts about Wilcox’s research and Rubio’s statement. Wilcox’s findings align with social conservatives, which opens him up to some scrutiny from the left. That said, the experts we interviewed raised several nonpartisan points about Wilcox’s findings. Professors noted that Wilcox’s research brief doesn’t carry the same weight as a peer-reviewed journal article. Also, they argued that Wilcox didn’t prove that fathers’ involvement caused their children to complete college -- instead he showed a correlation. Ohio State University sociologist Kristi Williams told PolitiFact that Rubio’s claim that having an active father ""makes"" children 98 percent more likely to graduate from college ""implies a causality that Professor Wilcox's study does not establish. (He) shows a correlation but does not establish this causality."" When we told Wilcox that professors raised concerns about causation, he pointed us to a paper written by other researchers in the Annual Review of Sociology about the causal effects of father absence. But that paper indicated there were studies that showed more of an effect on high school graduation. ""There was weak evidence for effects on college attendance and graduation, with only one of four studies finding significant results,"" the paper said. Lots of studies show that father involvement is helpful only when the fathers are competent parents and maintain a good relation to the mom, married or not, said Stephanie Coontz, director of research and public education at the Council on Contemporary Families and an Evergreen State College professor. ""Still, other research suggests that a better predictor of kids’ educational achievement than family structure is the mother’s education and educational aspirations for her children,"" Coontz told PolitiFact. ""Which suggests we might want to prioritize upping that, instead of trying to marry such women off to low-income men whose chronic economic stress and insecurity very often erodes their functioning as partners and parents."" The experts we interviewed didn’t dispute the concept that active fathers could play a role in their children completing college. However, they said there can be additional factors at play, especially income. ""Kids from well-off families don’t have to combine work and study to the degree that poorer kids do,"" George Washington University professor Michael Wiseman said. ""The question for Sen. Rubio should be, ‘Exactly what policies do you recommend for encouraging fathers to commit to their families and to marry the mother of their children?’ Talk about fatherhood is cheap. Ideas seem to be in short supply."" Our ruling Rubio said, ""Having an active father makes children 98 percent more likely to graduate from college."" Rubio was citing a research brief that looked at a survey of 11 different measures of fathers’ involvement with their children and whether the children graduated from college. But when Rubio used the word ""makes"" he implied that having an active father causes their children to graduate from college, and the research doesn’t prove causation. Other researchers said there could be other reasons for the disparities in college graduation. Rubio’s statement requires further explanation and relies on one piece of research only",Half True,"July 29, 2014"
"Says attorney general candidate Jon Richards ""went so far to say he would only enforce the laws with which he personally agreed.""","""Lawlessness"" was the subject of a June 26, 2014 fund-raising email that Brad Schimel, the lone Republican running for Wisconsin attorney general, sent to his supporters. He attacked President Barack Obama as well as the three Democratic candidates for attorney general, singling out one of them in particular. ""Like President Obama, my Democrat opponents have no respect for the Constitution or rule of law,"" Schimel wrote. ""In fact, one of my opponents went so far to say he would only enforce the laws with which he personally agreed."" Schimel's campaign confirmed the reference was to state Rep. Jon Richards, D-Milwaukee. It’s an extreme claim. Has Richards said he would only enforce laws he agrees with? The AG race Richards and two district attorneys -- Susan Happ of Jefferson County and Ismael Ozanne of Dane County -- will compete in the Aug. 12, 2014 primary, with the winner facing Schimel, the Waukesha County district attorney, in the Nov. 4, 2014 general election. Republican incumbent J.B. Van Hollen is not seeking a third four-year term. All four candidates have stated they wouldn’t defend certain laws, saying they violate the state or U.S. constitution. That could saddle taxpayers with higher costs because private attorneys could be brought in to do that work. The three Democrats said they wouldn't defend or appeal rulings on the state's ban on gay marriage, its voter ID law, or recent abortion regulations. Schimel said he would not defend Wisconsin's domestic partnership law, which gives same-sex couples some of the rights of married couples. Those positions drew criticism from Madison lawyer Lester Pines, who supports Ozanne in the attorney general race. After social conservatives in 2009 sued to block the domestic partnership law, Van Hollen refused to defend it. Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle then hired Pines to defend the law. Wisconsin's attorney general has a legal and professional duty to defend every state law unless the only arguments that can be made on its behalf are frivolous, Pines told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in a June 14, 2014 article. Disliking a law or even believing a law is unconstitutional, he said, is not enough to abandon the duty to defend it. Schimel's claim Asked to provide evidence for Schimel’s claim, campaign manager Johnny Koremenos argued that Richards has two standards in deciding whether to defend a law, ""the Constitution and the ‘wishes of the people.’"" ""This signals he will disregard the law and replace it with his perception of the ‘wishes of the people,’"" Koremenos said. ""It’s clear he is willing to place his own values and personal beliefs above the Constitution."" Koremenos also cited several news articles. But only two of them, both from February 2014, contain comments from Richards about his personal beliefs. And in neither case does Richards say he would enforce only laws he agrees with. First, an article in the Madison weekly newspaper Isthmus -- about whether efforts to repeal Wisconsin’s ban on gay marriage could benefit Democrats in the fall 2014 elections -- noted that Richards said in a news release he would not defend the state’s ban on same-sex marriage, which voters added to the state constitution in 2006. Richards has said he believes the ban violates the U.S. constitution and that he personally favors allowing same-sex marriage. ""Given Richards’ proactive stance, it's clear he doesn’t see same-sex marriage as a negative on the campaign trail,"" the Isthmus article stated. The article also said Richards’ political director, Andy Suchorski, did not disagree with this assessment, but that Richards’ position is ""not a political thing for him. It’s something he really believes. It’s why we’re pushing it.’"" That might seem like support for Schimel’s claim. But only regarding one law and only if taken out of context. Suchorski told us he had been asked a political question -- whether Richards was talking about gay marriage in the campaign because it was good for Democrats -- and had not been asked any legal questions. And the article itself is framed as a political analysis. Schimel also pointed to the first paragraph of a brief version of an Associated Press news story, which stated Richards had pledged to be ""the people’s attorney general"" if elected, and that he said Richards wouldn’t defend every state law if he thinks it violates the U.S. Constitution or goes against the wishes of the people. So, that’s an indication that Richards might not defend some laws if he thinks they are against the public’s wishes, but not that he would defend only laws he supports. Indeed, the full version of the AP article noted that Richards said he would defend laws with which he disagrees, though he didn’t provide an example during that particular news conference. However, despite Schimel’s claim, Richards has actually stated that he would defend laws he doesn’t support if he believes they are constitutional. Richards campaign spokesman Sachin Chheda pointed to three such occasions: In March 2014, Richards told the Waukesha Freeman newspaper: ""There are going to be times when there are laws that I voted against and personally might not support but I believe are consistent with the state and United States constitution, so, of course, the Department of Justice will defend them in that situation."" In January 2014 on the ""Upfront with Mike Gousha"" public affairs TV show, Richards was asked if he would vigorously enforce the state’s voter ID law if it is upheld in court. Richards called the law ""troubling,"" but said:  ""Obviously, If the law is passed, and a court rules that it’s constitutional, we’ll uphold the law, of course. But I do think the law that’s written really needs some scrutiny."" Also in January 2014, Richards was asked by WisPolitics.com if concealed carry ""is the right thing for Wisconsin."" Richards said several aspects of the law were ""problematic"" in terms of public safety, but he added: ""Having said that, I mean, the law is in place and as attorney general I would certainly work to make sure that if people apply for a concealed weapons permit, that it’s handled in a professional manner, quickly and expeditiously, and that we obey the law and we get those permits issued."" Our rating Schimel said Richards ""went so far to say he would only enforce the laws with which he personally agreed."" He provides no evidence that Richards made such a statement. On the contrary, Richards has said on multiple occasions he would enforce laws with which he doesn’t agree",False,"July 16, 2014"
"A company hired to do Common Core testing in Florida will ""attract every one of your children to become as homosexual as they possibly can.""","Heads up moms and dads -- a Florida lawmaker has unearthed one more conspiracy behind Common Core. A company that has been hired by Florida to give students tests will be recruiting every one of those students to become gay.   Think Progress, a liberal blog, dug up a video of state Rep. Charles Van Zant, R-Keystone Heights, speaking about the topic at the ""Operation Education"" conference -- a gathering of conservative religious groups who met about the theme of ""How education reforms are attacking America’s Foundation."" The Orlando conference was in March, but Think Progress posted a video clip of Zant on May 19, and the video then spread to other blogs. We listened to the full speech. Here is the portion that drew attention: ""Our new secretary of education in Florida recently appointed AIR to receive the $220 million contract for end-of-course exam testing and to prepare those tests. Please -- go on their website. Click the link to what they are doing with youth, and you will see what their agenda really is. They are promoting as hard as they can any youth that is interested in the LGBT agenda and even name it 2-S, which they define as having two spirits. The Bible says a lot about being double-minded.  ""These people that will now receive $220 million from the state of Florida, unless this is stopped, will promote double mindedness in state education, and attract every one of your children to become as homosexual as they possibly can. I'm sorry to report that to you. ... I really hate to bring you that news, but you need to know."" Van Zant encouraged listeners to research AIR, so we took him up on his suggestion and decided to check if AIR plans to ""attract every one of your children to become as homosexual as they possibly can."" We contacted Van Zant’s office and asked him to provide evidence to support his claim and did not get a response. We should note that our previous fact-checking shows people can’t be recruited to a particular sexual orientation. In 2011, GOP presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty said scientists are ""in dispute"" about whether being gay is a choice, and we rated that claim False. (Editor’s note: We added this point after our initial publication to address reader concerns.) Here, we’ll explore Van Zant’s specific claim that a testing company was making the attempt. Common Core tests and AIR In March, the state Department of Education announced that it would give a $220 million, 6-year contract to American Institutes for Research to develop and administer new accountability tests to replace Florida’s old testing system, the FCAT. The Washington-based nonprofit will develop tests aligned to the Florida Standards, the new education benchmarks based on the controversial Common Core State Standards. The new tests are expected to be ready for the 2014-15 school year. AIR has contracts to develop tests for about 10 states including Florida. When the state chose AIR, Common Core foes took aim at the testing company. The Florida Stop Common Core Coalition accused AIR of promoting a lesbian gay bisexual transgender ""lifestyle"", better known as LGBT, calling the choice of AIR ""completely unacceptable"": ""Besides implementing the same deceptive plan discussed at the governor's summit in August, the state has chosen a company that has a significant history of promoting identification of the GLBT lifestyle for children as young as seven years old,"" Florida Eagle Forum lobbyist Randy Osborne said in a Florida Stop Common Core Coalition letter to supporters. (Similar claims have been made by Common Core opponents in Utah and Tennessee.) We rated the coalition’s claim Half True in March. As we explained in that fact-check, one part of AIR’s business is creating materials for schools on LGBT Youth issues, in which it studies the youngsters’ experiences and offers recommendations for how to help the students. AIR only provides those materials to entities that request them -- currently that includes federal government contracts. AIR has no such contracts with the state Department of Education or any Florida districts to provide LGBT materials. (AIR is in discussions with a couple of districts in other states.) ""No entity in Florida has asked us to do LGBT work,"" AIR spokesman Larry McQuillan said. AIR describes its practice in this way: ""AIR’s Health and Social Development program develops knowledge and understanding about LGBT youth that takes account of their experiences and needs. AIR also enhances opportunities for the healthy development, well-being, and safety of LGBT children, youth, and their families by providing workforce training and technical assistance to service providers across systems addressing behavioral health, child welfare, education, juvenile justice, and homelessness."" AIR also does similar work in the areas of bullying and substance abuse in addition to its efforts in education, health and workforce matters. ""We are not an advocacy group,"" McQuillan told PolitiFact in March. ""AIR is a non-partisan, not-for-profit organization. We do educational assessment, research, health policy research and communication, and international development. We have supported many states by providing high-quality assessments of their specific state standards."" A few standards include sexual orientation We interviewed McQuillan about Van Zant’s comments and asked about what sort of material will be included on the tests. ""It’s the state that decides what questions they want to ask,"" he said. ""Florida is truly in control."" Joe Follick, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Education, said the tests administered by AIR will only include English language arts and math. ""Florida has always been and will continue to be committed to assessments that solely measure a student's knowledge of subject areas and critical thinking spelled out in the Florida Standards,"" Follick said in an email in response to our questions. Our ruling A firm hired to do Common Core testing in Florida will ""attract every one of your children to become as homosexual as they possibly can,"" Van Zant said. The firm hired to do testing, AIR, separately provides information to entities that request it to help them assist LGBT students. Currently, the federal government accesses AIR’s information but the organization doesn’t have such a contract with the state of Florida or any Florida districts. We found no evidence that when AIR administers tests in Florida that the testing process will involve recruiting students to become gay. Van Zant takes a somewhat limited connection between the testing company and gay and lesbian issues and then blows it up into a wild claim that lacks evidence",False Pants on Fire,"May 20, 2014"
"""Social science is irrefutable"" that children are better off being raised by a mom and a dad.","On ABC’s Easter Sunday edition of This Week, host Martha Raddatz discussed the intersection of religion and politics with her guests. ""Just a few months after taking office, Pope Francis spoke out on the issue of homosexuality, saying, ‘If they accept the Lord and have goodwill, who am I to judge them?’ "" she said. "" ‘They shouldn't be marginalized, the tendency to homosexuality is not the problem. They're our brothers.’ "" Faith and Freedom Coalition founder Ralph Reed told Raddatz he doesn’t support gay couples raising adopted children. ""This is about what's best for children here in the United States. And the social science is irrefutable,"" Reed said. ""And it is that a child who grows up in a home without the mother and father present and they both play very unique procreative, nurturing and socializing role, they're nine times more likely to end up dropping out of high school. They're five times more likely to end up in poverty. And they're three times more likely to end up addicted to drugs and alcohol."" PunditFact wanted to know what social science has to say about the effects gay parents have on children compared to straight parents. The social science statistics Reed called ""irrefutable"" actually have nothing to do with gay couples raising kids. Instead, they’re focused on the effects of children who grow up without a father in a one-parent household. Put another way, the studies focus on the quantity of parents and not their gender. Reed’s office pointed us to his book, as well as a Brookings Institution report that says parents who graduate from high school and bear children within marriage have a 2 percent chance of living in poverty. But neither the study nor his book draws any comparison between gay and straight marriages. In fact, it makes no mention of gay marriages. Other research often cited by gay parenting critics, like Sara McLanahan’s Growing Up With a Single Parent, similarly doesn’t include any information on gay parenting, specifically. Again, the critique is focused on having one parent present versus two. We decided not to investigate further the specific stats Reed cited once we realized they weren’t measuring what he said they were. Comparisons like Reed’s are ""a complete misuse of the research,"" said Judith Stacey, a New York University sociologist. We did find one study funded by conservative organizations as showing gay parents are worse than straight ones, but it’s been denounced by the American Sociological Association, the researcher’s own university and many reputable sociologists. In conducting the study, Mark Regnerus loosely defined same-sex couples and, in doing so, only spoke with two children who were actually raised by gay parents. Research is still limited, but many reputable studies so far have concluded that children of gay parents, generally speaking, are just as well off as children of straight parents. What’s more important is the number of parents a child has, experts told us. ""Kids are better off with two parents,"" said Andrew Cherlin, a sociology professor at Johns Hopkins University. ""But we don't have much evidence that those parents must be of the opposite gender."" Our ruling Reed said there’s ""irrefutable"" social science to show that children are better off being parented by a mother and father. That’s not right. What studies really show is that children are better off with two parents. Those studies do not focus on gender. All reputable research so far indicates that children brought up by gay parents are just well off as those brought up by straight parents",False,"April 22, 2014"
"Every one of ""more than 30 federal judges who have considered the issue of gay and lesbian rights since last June… ruled that marriage is a constitutional right and you cannot deprive individual citizens of that right based on their sexual orientation.""","For nearly a year, many federal judges have uniformly held that marriage is a fundamental right for all, a pair of lawyers said April 8, 2014, during the Civil Rights Summit at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library. Attorney David Boies, speaking after Ted Olson aired a similar point, put it this way: ""Here you have more than 30 federal judges who have considered the issue of gay and lesbian rights since last June. And every one of them--appointed by Republicans, appointed by Democrats, appointed by all of the last four or five presidents--in every area of the country, in Texas to Utah to Ohio to Oklahoma to Michigan, north south east west, every political affiliation, they’ve all ruled the same way. Every one of them has ruled that marriage is a constitutional right and you cannot deprive individual citizens of that right based on their sexual orientation."" We suspect Boies singled out judicial rulings since June 2013 because the U.S. Supreme Court that month overturned the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which had been enacted in 1996 to limit marriage, under federal law, to the union of one man and one woman. Writing for the 5-4 majority in U.S. v. Windsor, Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy said the law, known as DOMA, violated the core constitutional principle that people are entitled to equal protection under the law. Kennedy said DOMA’s main purpose was to demean and stigmatize homosexuals, relegating them to second-class status and humiliating the children they are raising. Kennedy concluded there can be no legitimate government purpose for a law intended to ""disparage and to injure."" Did more than 30 federal judges subsequently hold marriage to be a right for all? After asking Boies’ office for his backup information, we turned to Lambda Legal, a gay rights group, for its analysis. Spokesman Tom Warnke emailed us its compendium of pending ""marriage equality"" cases. As of March 6, 2014, according to the breakdown, the marriage restrictions of 28 states were at issue in 55 pending lawsuits--37 in federal court and 18 in state court. Only seven states that don’t currently provide for ""marriage equality"" were lacking legal challenges, according to the document: Alaska, Georgia, Indiana, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. By our read, the breakdown showed several federal judges siding with gay-marriage proponents, though we didn’t see the count getting as high as 30--or even 20. Using the breakdown and news stories we found using the Nexis search tool, we identified favorable rulings by district judges issued from December 2013 through February 2014 in Utah, Oklahoma, Virginia, Illinois, Texas, Kentucky, Michigan and Ohio: On Dec. 20, 2013, U.S. District Judge Robert J. Shelby of Utah said the state’s ban on gay marriage ""conflicts with the United States Constitution’s guarantees of equal protection and due process under the law. The state’s current laws deny its gay and lesbian citizens their fundamental right to marry and, in so doing, demean the dignity of these same-sex couples for no rational reason,"" the New York Times reported in a news story posted online that day. On Jan. 14, 2014, U.S. Senior Judge Terence Kern struck down Oklahoma’s ban on same-sex marriage, saying it ""intentionally discriminates against same-sex couples desiring an Oklahoma marriage license without a legally sufficient justification,"" according to a news story posted online that day by the Daily Oklahoman. On Feb. 13, 2014, U.S. District Judge Arenda Wright Allen of Virginia held the state’s ""marriage laws unconstitutionally deny Virginia's gay and lesbian citizens the fundamental freedom to choose to marry,"" according to a USA Today news story posted the next morning. On Feb. 21, 2014, U.S. District Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman issued a decision enabling Cook County couples to marry regardless of sexual orientation. In her decision, according to a Chicago Tribune news story posted online that day, Coleman said ""there is no reason to delay further when no opposition has been presented to this court and committed gay and lesbian couples have already suffered from the denial of their fundamental right to marry."" On Feb. 26, 2014, U.S District Judge Orlando Garcia of San Antonio, an appointee of Democratic President Bill Clinton, ruled unconstitutional the Texas ban on gay marriage and issued an injunction barring Texas from enforcing its prohibitions on same-sex couples marrying, the Austin American-Statesman said in a news story posted that evening. ""Without a rational relation to a legitimate government purpose, state-imposed inequality can find no refuge in our United States Constitution,"" Garcia held, though he stayed the ruling, enabling the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans to weigh in before Texans attempted to wed. On Feb. 27, 2014, U.S. District Judge John G. Heyburn II of Kentucky threw out part of Kentucky’s marriage restrictions, formalizing his Feb. 12 ruling that Kentucky's ban on same-sex marriages treated ""gay and lesbian persons differently in a way that demeans them,"" Fox News reported. ""Same-sex couples may change their names on official identifications and documents and obtain any other benefits of a married couple in Kentucky,"" the story said, though the ""order doesn't affect a related lawsuit seeking to force the state to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples."" On March 21, 2014, U.S. Senior Judge Bernard Friedman of Michigan overturned the state’s voter-approved bar on gay marriages, saying in his ruling that the limit violated the equal protection clause of the constitution. Lynn Wardle, a Brigham Young University law professor who has advocated that the Constitution leaves it to legislators to stipulate who may marry, emailed us his March 2014 paper on the legal status of marriage around the world, which brought to our attention two more rulings, one of them not to any advocate’s advantage. In a Tennessee case--which gets us to nine federal judges supportive of the legality of same-sex marriage since late 2013--U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger on March 14, 2014, granted a preliminary injunction against the state’s same-sex marriage ban in certain instances, the Tennessean newspaper reported that day. ""At this point, all signs indicate that, in the eyes of the United States Constitution, the plaintiffs’ marriages will be placed on an equal footing with those of heterosexual couples and that proscriptions against same-sex marriage will soon become a footnote in the annals of American history,"" Trauger wrote. By phone, Wardle suggested there has been at least a speed bump among the rulings in that a federal judge in Wisconsin declined to grant plaintiffs a preliminary injunction against the state’s bar on gay marriage, though he said that doesn’t signal she’ll ultimately rule against the plaintiffs. According to an undated web post by Lesbian/Gay Law Notes, published by the the LGBT Bar Association of Greater New York, the Wisconsin judge, Barbara B. Crabb, told plaintiffs that if they withdrew their motion for a preliminary injunction, she would set an expedited trial schedule; they did and she did. Our search yielded one ruling by a state appeals court arguably in the spirit of Boies’ claim. According to an Associated Press news story, New Mexico’s Supreme Court legalized gay marriage Dec. 19, 2013, by deeming the denial of marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples in violation of the state constitution’s ""equal protection"" clause. Meantime, Wardle guided us to William C. Duncan, the Utah-based president of the Marriage Law Foundation, which says it provides legal resources to defend and protect marriage between a husband and wife. By email, Duncan said he doesn’t see how Boies’ ""more than 30"" count of federal judges ruling favorably for gay-marriage proponents since June 2013 factually bears out. Duncan specularted that since then, more than 30 cases have been filed challenging state marriage laws. That’s different than what Boies said, no? ""Definitely,"" Duncan said. We failed to connect with Boies while a spokeswoman for his law firm, Dawn Schneider, suggested by email that his statement referred to much more than marriage equality rulings. We sought elaboration and didn’t hear back. Our ruling Boies said that since June 2013, every one of more than 30 federal judges who have considered gay and lesbian rights ""has ruled that marriage is a constitutional right and you cannot deprive individual citizens of that right based on their sexual orientation."" District judges have almost uniformly ruled for gay-marriage plaintiffs in this timeframe, but Boies’ count of such judges is considerably off.  We identified nine federal district judges who have issued such rulings since last June",Mostly False,"April 16, 2014"
"For educational testing, Florida ""has chosen a company that has a significant history of promoting identification of the GLBT lifestyle for children as young as seven years old.""","In choosing the American Institutes for Research to create new accountability tests for Florida, education commissioner Pam Stewart stressed the group’s ability to create tests specifically tailored for Florida. ""The new assessment will measure each child’s progress and achievement on the Florida Standards, which were developed with an unprecedented amount of public input,"" Stewart said in a press release. Common Core foes, who contend the ""Florida standards"" differ little from the widely adopted national Common Core academic standards, were again disappointed. With their efforts to derail the initiative itself foundering, one group took aim at the testing company instead. They noted the American Institutes for Research, called AIR, was tied to the Common Core with its work creating tests for the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium. Then they accused the organization of promoting a homosexual lifestyle for children. ""This is completely unacceptable. Besides implementing the same deceptive plan discussed at the governor's summit in August, the state has chosen a company that has a significant history of promoting identification of the GLBT lifestyle for children as young as seven years old,"" Florida Eagle Forum lobbyist Randy Osborne said in a Florida Stop Common Core Coalition letter to supporters. The group takes a page from Utahns Against Common Core, which also blasted AIR for its work on LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender)  issues after that state adopted AIR tests in 2012. There is some basis for the statements. AIR has an active practice area creating materials for schools on LGBT Youth issues, in which it studies the youngsters’ experiences and offers recommendations for how to help them survive a world that can be harsh and judgmental. It describes its practice in this way: ""AIR’s Human and Social Development program develops knowledge and understanding about LGBT youth that takes account of their experiences and needs. AIR also enhances opportunities for the healthy development, well-being, and safety of LGBT children, youth, and their families by providing workforce training and technical assistance to service providers across systems addressing behavioral health, child welfare, education, juvenile justice, and homelessness."" AIR only provides materials on gay and lesbian issues to schools and organizations that request it.  It also does similar work in the areas of bullying and substance abuse in addition to its efforts in education, health and workforce matters. And the group does not promote the issues, spokesman Larry McQuillan said. ""We are not an advocacy group,"" McQuillan said. ""AIR is a non-partisan, not-for-profit organization. We do educational assessment, research, health policy research and communication, and international development. We have supported many states by providing high-quality assessments of their specific state standards."" That is generally how the organization is viewed. ""AIR is known for being an independent and important provider of high-quality educational research, resources, and training for federal, state, and local stakeholders,"" said Anne Hyslop of the New America Foundation. ""Their work is widely respected, and they have a long history of producing valuable contributions to the field."" She suggested that the attack had more to do with the Common Core than with AIR itself. AIR received no criticism when selected to develop Florida’s hotly controversial ""value-added"" model of teacher evaluations. When it came to standards-related testing, though, the Stop Common Core coalition suggested that AIR’s work on LGBT issues would come through. ""We know that our children's tests will likely include these types of issues and that the test and other data will go to the state, the federal government, and to corporations,"" said co-founder Karen Effrem, urging tea party conservatives to pressure Gov. Rick Scott to stop the process. (PolitiFact Florida has fact-checked claims that personal data will go to the federal government and found such claims exaggerated.) Effrem and Osborne did not respond to interview requests. The issue could resonate with groups who find that even simple acknowledgement of LGBT people is activism to be demonized, said Daryl Presgraves of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network. Florida Department of Education spokesman Joe Follick, however, did not bite at the rhetoric, which he deemed essentially irrelevant. ""AIR was chosen for their ability to provide an assessment that aligns with Florida’s standards. Not anything else,"" Follick said. Republican legislative leaders also backed the commissioner. Senate President Don Gaetz ""supports Commissioner Stewart and is confident that AIR will develop a Florida-specific assessment that will test students based on Florida-specific standards,"" spokeswoman Katie Betta said. Our ruling The Florida Stop Common Core Coalition said that the American Institutes for Research promotes the identification of homosexual lifestyles in young children. It is true that AIR does research on LGBT youth issues and offers advice to organizations that request it on how to assist these children. This is one piece of the group’s initiatives, which also include work on disease management and student assessments. AIR does not advocate a homosexual lifestyle for children, nor is it an advocacy group at all. There is no indication that the organization or the state will have a homosexual agenda in its state testing. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context",Half True,"March 24, 2014"
"""I always supported civil unions.""","Charlie Crist, currently a Democratic candidate for governor, has apologized for his prior stance against gay marriage when he was Florida’s Republican governor. His change of heart isn’t that unusual for a politician in the past year or two, as national public opinion has shifted significantly toward support of same-sex marriage. In fact, Crist has tried to portray his evolution as being in line with that of President Barack Obama, who came out in favor of gay marriage in 2012 after favoring civil unions. Like Obama, ""I always supported civil unions,"" Crist told reporters outside a Fort Lauderdale fundraiser Jan. 28. ""But I thought about it just as President Obama thought about it, and I have come to the conclusion, as the Pope said himself, ‘Who am I to judge?’ I’ve always been a live-and-let live kind of guy. That’s what’s in my heart."" Crist made similar claims that he supported civil unions in his political autobiography and in an interview with an LGBT publication. But is it the truth? Charlie Crist’s flip flop on gay marriage In May 2013, Crist came out in support of gay marriage on Facebook. ""Some great news: On Tuesday, Delaware became the 11th state to allow marriage equality. And just a few days ago, Rhode Island adopted a similar measure, which followed victories last fall in Maine, Maryland and Washington. I most certainly support marriage equality in Florida and look forward to the day it happens here,"" Crist wrote. That was a reversal from 2008 when he voted for a state constitutional ban on gay marriage. We gave Crist a Full Flop on our Flip-O-Meter for his reversal. His past record on civil unions, however, is more complex. Crist on civil unions in 2005 and 2006 In general, civil unions include many of the rights of marriage as it pertains to the state level. Florida doesn’t have a civil unions law, but several cities and counties have domestic partnership registries that afford residents some rights. Gay marriage advocates view both civil unions and domestic partnerships as inferior to marriage. The topic of civil unions surfaced in 2005 and 2006 when Crist, the state attorney general at the time, ran for governor in a primary against then-CFO Tom Gallagher. The constitutional amendment in the works in 2005 banned gay marriage but also included a phrase interpreted by some gay rights advocates and lawyers to ban civil unions, too -- that ""no other legal union that is treated as marriage or the substantial equivalent thereof shall be valid or recognized."" In September 2005, Crist signed a petition in favor of the amendment at the request of the Christian Coalition. But in July 2006, Crist told radio talk show host Jim DeFede that civil unions for same-sex couples are ""fine, but I support marriage between a man and a woman."" Watermark, a Central Florida gay and lesbian publication, endorsed Crist in the homestretch of the Republican primary citing his support for civil unions. During the 2006 general-election debate, Crist said, ""We respect civil unions and I do as well. I think it's fine if people want to introduce and go into agreements to be able to have funeral arrangements made, things of that nature. But I think that marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman."" Moderator Chris Matthews asked: What's the difference between a civil union and a marriage, legally, under the eyes of the law? Crist replied: ""Under the eyes of this law, under the eyes of Florida, I believe that the difference is that civil unions are not the same as marriage. Marriage is a relationship like my mother and father had. Like I had before I got divorced. It is one of those unique institutions, not only in America but across the world where a man and a woman commit to one another. This is one of the things where I think it is fundamental, it is my belief that marriage should be between a man and a woman and it is different from civil unions."" Crist on the 2008 amendment Amendment backers weren’t able to collect enough signatures to get on the ballot until 2008. Proposition 2 stated: ""This amendment protects marriage as the legal union of only one man and one woman as husband and wife and provides that no other legal union that is treated as marriage or the substantial equivalent thereof shall be valid or recognized."" During Florida Supreme Court oral arguments Chief Justice Barbara Pariente asked whether the amendment would prohibit ""any legal sanction of a same sex relationship."" ""Absolutely not,"" replied Mathew Staver, chairman of Liberty Counsel, sponsor of the amendment. He also said it would not affect domestic partner registries. Justice Peggy Quince asked Staver if a same-sex couple entered some type of union in another state and moved to Florida whether that would be recognized in Florida. ""It depends upon what that union was. If it was the substantial equivalent of marriage, then yes, it (the amendment) would prevent that..."" Staver replied. Justice Raoul Cantero said the meaning of the phrase ""substantial equivalent"" would be open to challenge if the amendment should pass, though he added that it wasn’t a reason to keep it off the ballot. The Supreme Court ruled that the amendment passed the test of addressing only a single issue and containing clear language so it was allowed on the ballot. The ruling didn’t use the phrase ""civil unions"" but stated that the amendment could ban other types of unions. ""The plain meaning of these words, according to dictionary definition, is clear that the chief purpose of this amendment is to ensure that that unions between same-sex couples that are treated virtually identically to marriage will not be recognized in Florida,"" the court held. By early 2008, Crist backed away from the topic and asked the Republican Party of Florida not to spend money on it and direct their efforts elsewhere such as helping presidential candidate Sen. John McCain. ""I'll support it. I'll vote for it. Move on,"" Crist told the Orlando Sentinel in September. ""It's not top tier for me, put it that way."" On election day, Crist told reporters: ""I voted for it. It's what I believe in."" It passed with about 62 percent of the vote. In reality, what did amendment mean? There has been no subsequent challenge that would have tested the meaning of ""substantial equivalent,"" because Florida doesn’t have a civil unions law. PolitiFact sent the Florida Supreme Court’s ruling to a few law professors and asked if the amendment would ban civil unions. What they generally said was it would depend on how closely such a civil unions law resembled marriage (though advocates of gay rights told us they questioned the point of drafting a civil unions law that would be so weak as to pass that test). ""You could craft a civil union bill that is virtually identical or craft one that is not virtually identical,"" said University of Florida constitutional law professor Jon Mills. A statewide domestic-partnership registry law was approved by a state legislative committee in 2013 but later died. Supporters of the amendment fought the registry proposal. Crist on civil unions in 2010 During the Republican U.S. Senate primary in 2010, as he lagged behind his rival, Marco Rubio, Crist switched to run as an independent. Crist released a position paper in which he declared support for civil unions that ""provide the full range of legal protections"" including ""access to a loved one in the hospital, inheritance rights, the fundamental things people need to take care of their families."" Crist told CNN that he had supported a ban on gay marriage but added (once again) that he's a ""live-and-let-live kind of guy. … I think if partners want to have the opportunity to live together, I don't have a problem with that."" Following that interview, Crist put out a statement saying, ""I am fully supportive of civil unions and will continue to be as a United States senator, but believe marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman."" Crist’s adviser's response We sent a summary of our findings to Crist and to former state Sen. Steve Geller -- a Democrat who is informally advising Crist and whose law firm hosted the fundraiser where we heard Crist make the claim. ""It simply isn’t fair to say that someone who votes on a constitutional amendment that has both provisions that he supported (prohibition on gay marriage) and provisions that he opposed (prohibitions on civil unions) necessarily is in support of both or against both,"" Geller responded. ""Here, Charlie is clearly and unequivocally on the record as stating that he was in favor of civil unions. He stated this before Amendment 2 and after."" Our ruling When asked about his changing stance on gay marriage, Crist said, ""I always supported civil unions."" Crist repeatedly made statements in favor of civil unions between 2006 and 2010. In fact a gay publication endorsed him in the Republican primary in 2006 because of his stance on civil unions. But Crist sacrified his support for civil unions by voting for an anti-gay-marriage amendment that could have also banned civil unions. As the amendment headed toward the ballot, news stories often quoted experts who said civil unions could be at risk if the amendment were to pass. That supposition hasn’t been tested, since a statewide law on civil unions hasn’t passed. But while Crist was clearly conflicted about the amendment -- he didn’t campaign for it and he urged the Republican Party of Florida not to spend money on it -- he ultimately did say that he voted for it",Mostly False,"February 7, 2014"
"""Forty percent of the country is going to be in states that are tolerant of gay marriage or at least civil unions.""","There’s no denying 2013 saw a sea change for same-sex couples who sought government recognition of their relationships. Both court decisions and legislative action meant that 10 additional states recognized gay marriage. Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, speculated Dec. 29 on CNN’s State of the Union that changing views toward the gay community will continue in 2014. ""This will be a wedge issue on the Republican side. I mean 10 years ago, we had Republicans pushing a federal marriage amendment in the Senate to ban gay marriage,"" she said. ""Forty percent of the country is going to be in states that are tolerant of gay marriage or at least civil unions. And that number is only going to grow."" We wanted to see if Tanden’s number — that four in 10 Americans now live in states that recognize same-sex marriage or civil unions — is accurate. We contacted the Center for American Progress to see how Tanden reached her number. They pointed us to a year-end round up from the Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group for lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals. According to the organization, 38.37 percent of the population lives in states that allow same-sex marriage. (Note that this does not include civil unions, which we will address in just a bit.) That figure was released before a federal judge in December overturned a Utah ban on same-sex marriages. In the days since that decision, hundreds of gay and lesbian couples were married in Utah, though the state has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to halt further ceremonies while the ruling is appealed. Adding Utah to the mix, the Human Rights Campaign told PunditFact, would bring the total population living in states that allow gay marriage to 39.27. That was calculated by taking U.S. Census data from 2010 and comparing it with a list of states where same-sex marriage has been legalized, either through the courts or by legislative action. We wanted to double check the math ourselves. Gay marriage is now legal in 18 states — California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont and Washington — plus the District of Columbia, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan advocate for state legislative bodies. Civil unions or domestic partnerships between gay couples are allowed in Colorado, Nevada and Oregon. Using the most recent U.S. Census data estimates from 2013, here’s how the population breaks down in states that allow same-sex marriage or civil unions:  The total is about 43 percent. If you exclude the states that allow civil unions or domestic partnerships but not same-sex marriage, it comes out to about 39.15 percent of the population. By either measure, Tanden appears to be right. We should note that the Illinois General Assembly and the governor last year moved to legalize gay marriage in the state, but licenses won’t be available until June 2014. We also ran these numbers by opponents of same-sex marriage. Tanden’s figure was not disputed by Peter Sprigg, a senior fellow at the Family Research Council. But he said a better measure might be to compare the number of states where voters have approved ballot initiatives in opposition to same-sex marriage against states where residents voted in favor of it. Thirty states have approved constitutional amendments defining marriage as between a man and a woman. Those states make up two-thirds of the population and include California and Utah, where courts overturned voter referendums, and Colorado, Nevada and Oregon, where civil unions are legal. Only Maine, Maryland and Washington have held referendums that approved same-sex marriage laws. (We should point out that most states pass laws through the legislative branch, not via referendum.) Courts also played a heavy role in allowing gay marriage in California, Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New Jersey and Utah. During her remarks, Tanden suggested that the number of individuals living in states that allow same sex marriage is ""only going to grow."" As recently as 2010, only seven states recognized gay marriage, comprising just 17 percent of the country. But of the 29 states that don’t allow for same-sex marriages or civil unions, 25 have constitutional amendments that define marriage as between man and a woman. Many of those amendments ""require popular votes, usually alongside legislative action,"" to change them, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. ""Efforts to overturn constitutional prohibitions have begun in several states and litigation has also been initiated in several states"" but the NCSL also notes ""the scope for continued legislative change is limited."" Our ruling Tanden said, ""Forty percent of the country is going to be in states that are tolerant of gay marriage or at least civil unions."" Both expert sources and independently verified statistics back up those numbers if we define ""tolerant"" as states where same-sex marriage or civil unions are legal. Subsequent court decisions could raise or lower that number, and opponents note many of those states allowed same-sex marriage only after court intervention",True,"January 5, 2014"
"The Employment Non-Discrimination Act ""discriminates against Christian daycare, Christian parents, Christian business owners, and the rights of religious freedom.""","Early in the 2014 campaign season, religion has played an important role in the Arkansas Senate race. Incumbent Mark Pryor, a Democrat, released an ad recently about how the Bible guides him. Interestingly, when the National Republican Senatorial Committee attacked Pryor on the issue, challenger Rep. Tom Cotton’s office went against fellow Republicans to stand with Pryor. But that’s not where the debate about Pryor’s faith ends. It circles back to his November vote in favor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, a bill that would prevent workplace discrimination based on sexuality and gender identity. It passed in the Senate but hasn’t been taken up by the House. While the bill’s status is in flux, the debate among lawmakers, advocacy groups and religious leaders continues. The Traditional Values Coalition, a religious activist group, criticized Pryor for his ENDA vote. Andrea Lafferty, the coalition’s president, highlighted a perceived contradiction of Pryor’s religious beliefs in a Dec. 6 mass fundraising email. ""There's a reason why Pryor is attempting to run as a Christian in Arkansas,"" she said. ""It's because Pryor has voted for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) in Washington, a bill that discriminates against Christian daycare, Christian parents, Christian business owners, and the rights of religious freedom."" PolitiFact wanted to take a closer look at how religious organizations would fare if the bill becomes law. American Christianity and LGBT rights Before we take a look at the bill, let’s contextualize the coalition’s claim in the broader context of American Christianity. It’s important to note that within Christianity, gay rights is a divisive and complex issue. The Traditional Values Coalition’s ENDA disapproval is shared by other Christian groups, like the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. They expressed their view in an Oct. 31 press release: ""The USCCB continues to promote the dignity of both work and marriage and to oppose unjust discrimination on any grounds, including those related to homosexual inclination or sexual identity. But we cannot support a bill, like ENDA, that does not justly advance the dignity of all workers and authentic non-discrimination."" At the same time, groups like ReconcilingWorks, a Lutheran group that welcomes gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) members, support ENDA’s passage. ""ReconcilingWorks: Lutherans for Full Participation believes that all hardworking people — including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people — should have a fair chance to earn a living and provide for their families without fear of being fired for reasons that have nothing to do with their job performance,"" spokesman Tim Fisher said. ""We strongly support the passage of ENDA."" As the gay rights movement gains more traction, some Christians have changed their perspectives. ""Most American Christians do not want a gay pastor overseeing their church, and that is not likely to change soon,"" said Kate Bowler, an American Christianity professor at Duke University. ""However, we are seeing thawing numbers of those who agreed that gay people should be allowed same-sex unions."" The basics The ENDA bill would prohibit private-sector employers and government employers on the local, state and federal levels from discriminating against employees based on sexual orientation and gender identity. That protects people who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender. Under the law, employers can’t fire or refuse to hire people based on actual or perceived sexuality and gender identity (which need not align with a person’s biological identity). Churches and other institutions with religious purposes (like schools and daycares) are exempt from the ENDA rules, just as they are from the religious discrimination portion of the Civil Rights Act of 1964’s Title VII. Under Title VII, and therefore under ENDA, religious organizations, which need not be church-run, would be exempt. Additionally, all businesses with fewer than 15 employees are exempt, whether they’re religious or not. Nelson Tebbe, a professor at Brooklyn Law School who specializes in religious liberty, said ENDA’s religious exemption exceeds Title VII’s. ""It’s broader because the religious exemption in Title VII only allows religious organizations to discriminate on the basis of religion,"" he said. But it doesn’t allow religious groups to discriminate based on factors like an employee’s gender or race. So by permitting religious organizations to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, ENDA allows them more flexibility than Title VII. Let’s break down the Traditional Values Coalition claim to see how each mention would be treated if ENDA becomes law: Daycare: ""If it were a secular daycare that just happened to be owned by a religious individual with a conviction that prohibited them from hiring LGBT folk, then the exemption would not apply,"" Tebbe said. He added that nonprofit daycares with religious affiliations would be exempt. Parents: ""There is nothing in ENDA that would require parents to alter their beliefs or what they teach their children about religion, homosexuality, marriage equality, et cetera,"" said Ian Thompson, an American Civil Liberties Union representative for LGBT issues. Business owners: For-profit companies with 15 employees or more would need to abide by ENDA, said Dena Sher, an ACLU religious liberty counsel. But Christian nonprofits and Christian (or any other) businesses with fewer than 15 employees would be exempt. Tebbe also noted that religious organizations who don’t hire LGBT people are protected under ENDA. Rights of religious freedom: ""Not only does the Constitution protect religious freedom broadly, but existing federal discrimination law already prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion,"" Thompson said. The Traditional Values Coalition doesn’t believe that these religious exemptions are broad enough. ""ENDA would not cover any secular companies and organizations that are run by committed Christians,"" said Harry Mihet, a Liberty Counsel lawyer the coalition referred us to. Mihet is correct. But as far as discrimination goes, in the bill’s full text, there’s no reference to Christianity, or to any other individual religion, for that matter. All religions are treated the same and can legally invoke the same exemption. And Christianity isn’t the only religion that has historically grappled with acceptance of sexuality and gender identity issues. Merriam-Webster defines discrimination as ""the practice of unfairly treating a person or group of people differently from other people or groups of people."" To say that the law discriminates against Christians doesn’t fit based on our experts’ interpretation of the bill and the inclusion of an overall religious exemption that applies to any religion, not just Christians. ""If you had some exemption that wasn’t available to Christians, that would be discrimination,"" said Doug Laycock, a law and religious studies professor at the University of Virginia. ""The only way they’re treated differently is they get an exemption."" Our ruling The Traditional Values Coalition said ENDA discriminates ""against Christian daycare, Christian parents, Christian business owners, and the rights of religious freedom."" The bill’s religious exemption indicates that churches, church-run initiatives and other religious businesses need not comply by employing people of all sexualities and gender identities. And there’s no special negative treatment for Christians. Businesses of any religion could qualify for the exemption. Individuals of any faith who oppose sexuality would have to abide by the law, so no religion is singled out. We can understand why religious conservatives may take issue with this bill. However, the rhetoric in the email is too broad and overstated, and claims to speak for all Christians",False,"December 16, 2013"
"Says a Justice Department memo ""directs that you must openly embrace gay marriage and homosexuality.""","President Barack Obama’s administration ""has gone out of its way to thump Christians,"" a Texas U.S. House member said in a July 15, 2013, interview with Fox News. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Tyler, went on to say the nation’s top lawyers have been directed to embrace gay marriage, saying: ""It's also been true in the Department of Justice right now, directly under this president, his buddy, Eric Holder. There's a memo that directs that you must openly embrace gay marriage and homosexuality. And silence is considered to be disapproval,"" Gohmert said, according to CQ Transcriptions. The Justice Department required workers to embrace gay marriage and more? Employee group brochure To our email inquiry, Gohmert spokeswoman Kimberly Willingham pointed out a May 28, 2013, blog post by Todd Starnes, a Fox News commentator, headlined: ""DOJ Tells Employees to Verbally Affirm Homosexuality."" Starnes, citing Liberty Counsel, a law firm that says it’s dedicated to ""advancing religious freedom, the sanctity of life, and the family,"" wrote that department employees were emailed a brochure,  ""LGBT Inclusion at Work: The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Managers."" He wrote too that the brochure was created by DOJ Pride, an association of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender agency employees. The brochure lists about 20 ""do’s"" and ""don’ts"" running from appropriate language to dealing with offensive jokes to declaring one’s own sexual orientation and respecting someone who does so. Given Gohmert’s statement, we narrowed our focus to brochure references to gay marriage and to embracing homosexuality. Under the heading ""Use Inclusive Language,"" the brochure encourages recipients to ""use inclusive words like ‘partner,’ ‘significant other’ or ‘spouse’ rather than gender-specific terms like ‘husband’ and ‘wife.’"" Another section says: ""Do acknowledge important events in an LGBT employee’s life--e.g., same-sex marriage, birth of a child, illness of a spouse, or death of a partner’s parent--in the same way you would for a heterosexual employee."" A theme of the brochure is respect for an employee’s sexual orientation. A section titled ""Come Out"" says: ""Do let your employees know they’ll be treated with fairness and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, by ‘coming out’ as a straight ally."" Recipients are encouraged to display the brochure or a DOJ Pride sticker in clear view or request that their office receive follow-up training on gender identity in the workplace. Also: ""Do consider coming out of the closet if you are LGBT and not out at work. The presence of visible LGBT managers communicates that your office is open and accepting."" In another section, the brochure says that if an employee ""comes out to you,"" don’t ""judge or remain silent. Silence will be interpreted as disapproval. Do respond with interest and curiosity. Asking respectful questions will set a positive, supportive tone."" By telephone, Matt Barber, a Liberty Counsel attorney, told us the brochure was sent to agency employees on May 14, 2013. At our request, Barber emailed us what he described as a copy of that email with the name of the whistleblower worker who brought it to the firm’s attention redacted. One agency's distribution The ""To"" line of the email says, ""Global Distribution."" The email message, under the subject ""LGBT Pride Month,"" describes the attached brochure as complementing a planned LGBT Pride Month observance. The email expresses hope that the brochure, ""drafted with input from key department stakeholders,"" will be a useful tool ""as you work to create an office environment that is welcoming to, and supportive of, all employees, including LGBT employees."" The email closes with: ""This message has been authorized by Nelson A. Santos, Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Forensic Sciences."" By phone, Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona told us Santos works for the Drug Enforcement Administration. Talamona initially told us that the publication was distributed to ""some employees"" by email with the department’s awareness. However, she said, it is not an agency policy or directive. Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson later emailed a statement that seemed to indicate the DEA official sent the brochure to many of that agency's workers. All told, its employees account for some 9,000 of the Justice Department’s 115,000 workers, Iverson said. Iverson's statement said ""DOJ Pride, an employee association, sent informational material, on its own behalf, to some DOJ employees. The material was clearly identified as a DOJ Pride product. We have also recently learned one component’s diversity official distributed the information via email to its employees on behalf of DOJ Pride. The single-page document was produced on a DOJ computer and involved limited use of a DOJ printer to make a few dozen copies, in line with the department’s de minimis use policy allowing employees to make minimal personal use of their DOJ computers when the cost to the government is negligible."" Barber said that while the brochure was authored by an employee group, not the department proper, ""it came under the auspices of the larger Department of Justice."" He added that the agency ""knows it would be unconstitutional to expressly compel department employees to openly embrace homosexuality and gay marriage."" The brochure, he said, delivers a compliance threat that is implied rather than explicit. Diversity policy More broadly, the department says online it has a diversity management policy: ""We work diligently to attract and retain a workforce that represents the range of personal and professional backgrounds, and experiences and perspectives that arise from differences of culture and circumstances. This includes persons of varying age, ethnicity, gender, disability, race, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, national origin, political affiliation, socioeconomic and family status, and geographic region."" As noted in a May 24, 2013, blog post by WND, a conservative Internet news organization, Holder aired support for diversity in a June 6, 2012, speech marking the agency’s LGBT Pride Month celebration. After mentioning efforts to combat school bullying and to help students who feel unsafe or victimized, Holder said: ""It is this same determination that guides the Justice Department’s internal efforts to create a more inclusive work environment, and to strengthen our mission to serve all Americans by attracting a diverse range of qualified individuals; and by providing the opportunities--and the support necessary--for every department employee to develop, to grow, and to thrive both personally and professionally."" Our ruling Gohmert said a Justice Department memo ""directs that you must openly embrace gay marriage and homosexuality."" The department promotes diversity. But there doesn't appear to be a department memo or mandate that employees openly support gay marriage or homosexuality.

Says residents of Texas and San Antonio can be fired or denied jobs because they are gay.,"In a June 14, 2013, opinion article in the San Antonio Express-News, state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte urged the city to ""pass updates to the city code ensuring that the city, and those who contract with the city, will not discriminate against their employees because of their sexual orientation, gender identity or veterans' status."" Supporting the measures, which the City Council was expected to consider in August 2013, the Democrat said of a fellow San Antonio resident, an Iraq veteran: ""Here in his home state and his home city, he can be denied or fired from a job just because he is gay."" We figured Van de Putte was making a broad statement about all Texans and all San Antonians; a spokesman for the senator, Lee Nichols, confirmed that. Like nearly all U.S. states, Texas is an employment-at-will state. That means, as the Texas Municipal League puts it in a legal white paper, ""Generally, employees without a written employment contract can be fired for good cause, bad cause, or no cause at all,"" as long as that cause is not illegal. Section 21.051 of the Texas Labor Code, Nichols said via email, makes it illegal for employers to discriminate against employees or applicants because of ""race, color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age,"" but does not mention sexual orientation. Van de Putte offered a bill during the 2013 Legislature’s regular session to extend that protection, he said. Here’s the law, part of the Texas Labor Code’s Title 2, Subtitle A, Chapter 21: SUBCHAPTER B. UNLAWFUL EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES Sec. 21.051.  DISCRIMINATION BY EMPLOYER.  An employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because of race, color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age the employer: (1)  fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or discriminates in any other manner against an individual in connection with compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment;  or (2)  limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or applicant for employment in a manner that would deprive or tend to deprive an individual of any employment opportunity or adversely affect in any other manner the status of an employee. 
So while it’s illegal in Texas to ""deprive an individual of any employment opportunity"" or refuse to hire someone because of gender, race and several other factors, it isn’t against state law to do so because they are homosexual or of any other sexual orientation. Spokesman Charlie Joughin at the Human Rights Campaign, a national gay rights group, told us 21 states have laws meant to protect residents against job discrimination based on sexual orientation. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that ""in 29 states in this country you can still get fired for … being gay,"" as Martina Navratilova claimed in a May 2013 interview. PolitiFact rated the ex-tennis star’s statement Half True, noting significant exceptions. In all states, federal and state government employees have certain protections because courts have backed the idea that sexual orientation is one of the categories that would permit a discrimination lawsuit under the right of equal protection in the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. PolitiFact also noted that cities or individual employers can have anti-discrimination policies even if their state does not. That’s the case in several Texas cities. City of Austin spokeswoman Patricia Fraga told us by phone that Austin ordinances protect against discrimination citywide in employment, housing and public accommodations -- a term that takes in businesses such as restaurants, theaters, bars and stores -- for reasons that include sexual orientation. Ordinances in Dallas and Fort Worth bar such discrimination citywide. Houston has several related ordinances, spokesman Justin Concepcion of the mayor’s office told us by phone. El Paso has a citywide ordinance against housing and public accommodation discrimination for sexual orientation, but not employment, deputy city attorney Laura Gordon told us by phone. San Antonio’s website advises its employees, ""Unlawful discrimination may be occurring if you are treated differently because of"" reasons that include sexual orientation. The proposed measures were described by the Express-News in a July 25, 2013, news blog entry as a ""proposal to fix the city’s anti-discrimination policies, which right now are a hodgepodge of disparate references scattered across the city’s code."" Van de Putte spokesman Servando Esparza told us by phone that protections at the city level were important, but not a comprehensive guarantee of rights, because a resident could move or rules could change as new city officials came in. ""We wanted to make sure this was solved at the state level,"" he said. Our ruling Van de Putte said that a Texan and San Antonian could be ""denied or fired from a job just because he is gay."" In Texas, it appears, many workers can be fired for nearly any reason. That said, state law also doesn’t bar discrimination based on sexual orientation. But several major cities do and Texans who work for state or federal government -- and even for San Antonio city government itself -- have some protections, too",Half True,"July 26, 2013"
"Most Americans want ""traditional marriage,"" as defined by the Defense of Marriage Act.","Public reaction was fairly predictable when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, as unconstitutional. Many Republicans said marriage should between one man and one woman, and they supported the federal government’s refusal to recognize gay marriage or grant federal benefits to same-sex spouses. Most Democrats said the opposite, and they hailed the Supreme Court’s 5-4 decision striking down DOMA as a gay-rights breakthrough. And then there was Bill Johnson, a congressman from Ohio, who sent an email statement that made us snap to attention. ""Americans of faith are under attack,"" Johnson, a Republican from Marietta, said in his June 27 statement.  ""First, the President refused to defend the Defense of Marriage Act, despite his legal, constitutional responsibility to do so.  Then, liberals on the Supreme Court refused to defend traditional marriage itself, even though that's what most Americans want. I will defend traditional marriage, because it's not a government's job to define it -- it was already defined by God."" PolitiFact Ohio has no desire to debate theology and no need to address whether Obama had an obligation to defend DOMA in court. The point is widely debated, but many of his predecessors from both parties also refused to defend laws they thought were unconstitutional. But another part of Johnson’s claim caught our interest -- that the traditional definition of marriage is ""what most Americans want."" We asked Johnson’s communications director, Mollie Riester, how Johnson knows that. She pointed to two things: A recent poll commissioned by the Huffington Post, and the fact that ""in most cases, when Americans are given a direct choice, they have chosen to defend traditional marriage. The basis for that is the total number of times a proposition has been on a ballot."" Let’s examine those in reverse order. It is accurate that voters in a majority of states have acted to prohibit same-sex couples from marrying. Even counting a handful whose legislatures have carved out exceptions for domestic partnerships or civil unions, 30 states including Ohio have passed constitutional bans on gay marriage, and five more have done so through statutory laws, according to a review by the Washington Post. But the other part of Riester’s answer -- current public opinion -- makes it problematic to use voter-passed bans as a measure to gauge gay-marriage opposition. That is, we looked at the date each state passed its ban, using a state-by-state search tool maintained by Freedom to Marry, a group favoring gay-marriage rights, and found that the majority passed their bans between 2004 and 2006, with a few earlier and a few later. A CNN timeline confirms this as well. In fact, when Texas became the 19th state to adopt a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, the year was 2005. Ohio voters passed their ban in 2004, as did voters in 10 other states, That doesn’t seem very long ago. But a wide array of public opinion polls show that views have shifted dramatically since then. Support for gay marriage has climbed steadily. A Washington Post-ABC News poll in March found that 58 percent of Americans believe it should be legal for gay couples to marry, and only 36 percent believe it should be illegal. More recently, a Pew Research Center poll after the Supreme Court ruling on DOMA -- and a related one that allowed California to overturn its gay-marriage ban -- found that 45 percent of people said they approved of the decisions, while 40 percent disapproved. On the related question of whether gays and lesbians should be allowed to wed legally, Pew said in May that 52 percent said yes and 42 percent said no. That would suggest exactly the opposite of what Johnson claimed when he said the ""Supreme Court refused to defend traditional marriage itself, even though that's what most Americans want."" But Riester, Johnson’s spokeswoman, cited a Huffington Post poll, so we took a look. That poll said that 43 percent of Americans said the government should recognize same-sex marriage and 45 percent said the government should not. The ""should not"" had the lead, in other words. But rather than indicating a majority opinion, this actually was a statistical toss-up, because the poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. What about all those states -- a majority of the nation -- that supported gay-marriage bans? Consider how much has changed since then. There is consistency in the polling, but we’ll give you two specific examples. From Pew, tracking  the issue since 1996: In 2004, the year Ohio voters decided that gay marriage should not be legally recognized, 64 percent of Americans agreed with that sentiment. By February 2012, the figure had dropped to 43 percent, and a larger share -- 48 percent -- favored same-sex marriage rights. Or to quote a USA Today story from July 1: ""By an unprecedented 55 percent - 40 percent, Americans say marriages between same-sex couples should be recognized by law as valid, with the same rights of traditional marriage. That's the highest level of support since Gallup began asking the question in 1996. Then, fewer than half that number, 27%, backed the idea."" Whether state voters will change their constitutions to support this shift is to be seen. Still, attitudes are a-changin’, to borrow a Bob Dylan line from another era of social shifts. Johnson would have been correct in 2004 and 2006, when voters throughout the country passed state constitutional bans on gay marriage. But in 2013, his statement has only an element of truth. It is dated",Mostly False,"July 10, 2013"
"""Every major religion is opposed to same-sex marriage.""","
In two rulings on the final day of its 2012-2013 term, the U.S. Supreme Court struck downparts of the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), the 1996 law that banned the government from recognizing same-sex marriages performed in states where they are legal, and let stand a lower court ruling that struck down a California gay marriage ban. 
The rulings left in place the laws that ban same-sex marriage in 37 states. Among them is Ohio. 
FreedomOhio, an advocacy group pushing to overturn Ohio's ban, said the high court's decisions add momentumto its effort to get the issue on the November 2014 ballot. 
Citizens for Community Values, a Cincinnati-based conservative group that championed the 2004 constitutional ban, said it was ready to fight measures that would bring same-sex marriage to the state. 
Phil Burress, president of the group, was quoted sayingin March that legalizing same-sex marriage in Ohio is unlikely: ""I can't look into the future, but I just don't ever see it happening. This nation was founded on Judeo-Christian principles, and, like Judeo-Christian beliefs, every major religion is opposed to same-sex marriage. You can't allow same-sex marriage until you destroy all religions."" 
While his last sentence is matter of opinion that PolitiFact Ohio can't rate, we wondered about the accuracy of his statement about religious opposition. 
The Supreme Court decisions affected the legal recognition of marriage under civil law. They do not extend to religious recognition. 
But what do religions say about same-sex marriage? 
Citizens for Community Valuestold us it stands behind the statement by Burress, which was also cited in a Plain Dealer story last month, and added: ""The mainstream, conservative and orthodox majorities of the primary religions in America, that is Judaism, Christianity and Islam, oppose same-sex marriage."" 
They referred us to a comprehensive survey of the U.S. religious landscapeby the nonpartisan Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. It details the country's current religious makeup and changes in religious affiliation. 
Pew also presents an overview of official positions on same-sex marriageamong major religions in the United States. These are the findings, summarized alphabetically: 
American Baptist Churches USA has affirmed that ""God's design for sexual intimacy places it within the context of marriage between one man and one woman."" 
Buddhism has no universal position on same-sex marriage. 
The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops opposes same-sex marriage, affirming that ""marriage is a faithful, exclusive and lifelong union between one man and one woman."" 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints does not endorse same-sex marriage; Mormon theology says that ""marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God."" 
The General Convention of the Episcopal Church last year approved a liturgy for blessing same-sex relationships. ""Each Episcopal bishop will decide whether to allow churches in his or her jurisdiction to use the new liturgy to bless same-sex unions,"" Pew reports. ""And in those dioceses where blessing same-sex relationships is permissible, no Episcopal priest will be required to perform the blessing ceremony."" 
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America defines marriage as ""a lifelong covenant of faithfulness between a man and a woman,"" but allowed congregations to recognize and bless same-sex unions. 
Hinduism has no official position on same-sex marriage. 
Islamic law forbids homosexuality. 
In Judaism, the Reform and Reconstructionist Jewish movements support gay and lesbian rights, including same-sex marriage. The Conservative Jewish movement has a ceremony to allow same-sex couples to marry. Individual rabbis can choose not to officiate at same-sex weddings. 
Orthodox Judaism does not accept same-sex marriage. 
The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod's position is that same-sex marriage is ""contrary to the will of the Creator."" 
The National Association of Evangelicals does not support gay marriage or civil unions. 
The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman -- though, Pew notes, its General Assembly ""urged state legislatures to give individuals in same-gender relationships the right to be joined in civil unions."" 
The Southern Baptist Convention is opposed to gay marriage. 
The Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations passed a resolution in 1996 in support of same-sex marriage. 
The United Church of Christ’s General Synod has voted to legally recognize and advocate in favor of same-sex marriage. ""Given the autonomous nature of United Church of Christ churches,"" Pew reports, ""each congregation may adopt or reject the recommendations of the General Synod."" 
The United Methodist Church affirms that marriage is between a man and a woman. 
""Religious groups do not speak with one voice on the same-sex marriage issue,"" said a report in March from Religion & Ethics Newsweekly, ""but more oppose it than support it."" 
""Religious groups fall on both sides of the same-sex marriage debate,"" the Public Religion Research Institutereported in March. 
Burress would have been on solid ground stating that the majority of major religions do not approve same-sex marriage. The opposition is significant. Most of the biggest religious groups do not accept same-sex marriage. 
But ""most"" is not ""all."" The opposition is not unanimous. Views varywithin Judeo-Christian tradition. The number of denominations accepting same-sex marriage has been increasing",Half True,"July 9, 2013"
"""We're already seeing bakers and florists and photographers forced to participate in same-sex marriages under the threat of law and in some cases even jail.""","Let’s step away for a moment from the political implications of the U.S. Supreme Court decisions on same-sex marriage and fast-forward straight to the wedding day: What does it mean for those who make the white-tiered frosted wedding cake, arrange the bouquet tossed by the bride, or snap the ""I Do"" pics? Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, said on CBS’ Face the Nation a few days after the ruling that such wedding vendors have already been ""forced"" to serve same-sex couples. ""We're already seeing bakers and florists and photographers forced to participate in same-sex marriages under the threat of law and in some cases even jail. I can't think of anything that's more un-American than that. ... "" Host Bob Schieffer responded: ""How is it that bakers and florists are being forced to participate in this? I'm not sure I understand what you're saying here."" Perkins replied: ""Well, we're seeing in Washington state, Colorado, and some of the other states that have these anti-discrimination statutes that are being imposed, that when a same-sex couple comes and says, ‘I want you to take pictures of my wedding,’ or ‘I want you to bake a cake.’ And they say, ‘Look, my religious convictions will not allow me participate in that,’ they're literally being sued by the government, not the individuals, and they've even been adjudicated in such places as New Mexico. So we're going to see a loss of religious freedom. There is no question about it. It's already happening."" Have there been bakers who have laid down their wire whisks and refused to bake a cake for a gay couple and hauled off to jail? A florist nervously piecing together a floral arrangement under the threat of a cop? We decided to investigate. State anti-discrimination laws used in some legal challenges In June, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a section of the Defense of Marriage Act that bars federal benefits for married same-sex couples, and it dismissed a case on Proposition 8, California’s law that banned gay marriage. The Prop 8 ruling means that same-sex couples in California can now get married again, but neither ruling makes gay marriage legal in every state -- currently 12 states allow gay marriages. While same-sex marriage laws can include exemptions for religious clergy who don’t want to officiate such unions, there aren’t typically exemptions for wedding vendors. So it’s possible for gay couples to take legal action against wedding vendors who refused to serve them if there are state or local anti-discrimination laws in place that include sexual orientation. About 21 states have such, according to the Human Rights Campaign, a group that advocates for gay rights. (Florida isn’t one of them, although some counties or cities have such laws.) ""These nondiscrimination laws say you cannot refuse to serve a couple because of sexual orientation,"" said Sarah Warbelow, an attorney and state legislative director for the Human Rights Campaign. ""If you are a photographer and a same-sex couple comes to you and says we want to employ you, the photographer for whatever event -- whether it's a marriage ceremony, commitment ceremony or whether it’s a birthday party -- the laws of those states state you cannot refuse them on basis of sexual orientation."" Each state can have their own process and penalties -- the ones we reviewed are generally heard before a civil rights or human rights commission. It’s theoretically possible a vendor who lost such a lawsuit could face jail if they refused to comply with the order, but Warbelow said, ""I’ve never heard of anyone actually going to jail."" Masterpiece Cakeshop in Colorado The Family Research Council directed us to multiple cases, including one particular case that they argue includes the threat of jail: Masterpiece Cakeshop. In 2012, a gay couple visited the suburban Denver shop in search of a cake for a Colorado celebration following their Massachusetts wedding. After the cake shop refused, the ACLU initiated a complaint on behalf of the two men. The Colorado attorney general’s office later filed a formal complaint which will be heard before the state’s civil rights commission in September. The owner has said, ""We would close down the bakery before we would compromise our beliefs."" The cake shop’s lawyer, Nicolle Martin, has said if the owner loses he could face up to a year in jail. In the meantime, though, the Colorado Legislature has taken action to repeal the criminal penalties for discrimination in places of public accommodations, which had included up to a year in jail and/or a $300 fine. The provision had never been used, and the repeal coincided with legislators passing a civil unions bill. We reached bill co-sponsor state Sen. Pat Steadman, D-Denver, who told us that the repeal officially goes into effect in August, and he didn’t believe that a prosecutor would use that part of the law in the last month that it remains on the books. ""A D.A. has to choose to file misdemeanor charges,"" Steadman said. ""It never happened. It never will."" However, since the Masterpiece Cakeshop incident occurred in 2012, Martin said it’s still possible that the law on the books at the time -- which did include jail -- would apply. ""I have received no assurances from the state of Colorado that no prosecution will be pursued even in light of this recent repeal,"" Martin told PolitiFact. We checked with both the Colorado attorney general and the local district attorney; no criminal charges are pending. Even if no one has been jailed so far, the threat remains, said Ken Klukowski, a senior fellow for religious liberty at the FRC. ""It is no comfort to a person of faith to cite the frequency a person is criminally prosecuted and put behind bars especially in a rapidly changing legal environment ...,"" he said. ""The threat of prosecution has a chilling effect on people's behavior."" Completed cases in Vermont and New Jersey Of the other cases related to wedding vendors cited by Perkins, only a couple have reached a conclusion. The Wildflower Inn in Vermont  told a lesbian couple in 2010 that the inn didn't host ""gay receptions"" because of the owners' ""personal feelings."" After a lawsuit, it agreed to pay a $10,000 civil penalty, to place $20,000 in a charitable trust and to stop hosting weddings -- whether the couple is gay or straight. The director of the Vermont Human Rights Commission told PolitiFact that the inn has paid the first half of the fine and the second half is due in September. The owners didn’t face jail based on the complaint itself. However, under Vermont law, failure to pay a fine can lead to a civil contempt action. ""This is no different than any other defendant who has a judgment against him/her and refuses to pay,"" director Karen Richards told PolitiFact in an email. ""As a practical matter, most unpaid judgments do not result in contempt proceedings, nor do they result in incarceration, except in very extreme cases, such as child support cases, where the party clearly has the money and is basically thumbing its nose at the court. I am not aware of any case in Vermont that resulted in a jail time for a defendant in any type of discrimination case."" In New Jersey, the Methodist Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association refused to allow a lesbian couple to hold a ceremony at its boardwalk pavilion in 2007. The New Jersey Division on Civil Rights ruled in 2012 that the association, which gets a tax exemption, must cease and desist violating the law but did not impose a fine or other penalty. The association stopped renting out the pavilion for marriages, an attorney who represented the association during the legal battle told PolitiFact. New Jersey can impose a fine of up to $10,000 for a first offense. A provision of the law states that anyone violating an order as a result of a legal challenge could face up to a year in jail or a fine. ""However, no attorney I've spoken with here is aware of this provision ever having been used to prosecute anyone, and there are no reported cases of it,"" Lee Moore, a spokesman for the state's Department of Law and Public Safety, told PolitiFact.   Pending cases One case we reviewed received considerable publicity but ultimately went nowhere. In Oregon, a TV news station reported that Sweet Cakes by Melissa co-owner Aaron Klein allegedly told a lesbian couple that ""they were abominations to the Lord"" and refused to fill the order. Klein told the media he didn’t use that phrase, and that after the publicity he received death threats and his wedding business fell by half. The couple contacted the attorney general, who determined it would fall under the jurisdiction of the state’s Bureau of Labor and Industries. A spokesman for the bureau told PolitiFact the couple didn’t file their case with the agency, and we couldn’t find any evidence that the case was re-filed elsewhere.

New York’s human rights law includes a provision that a person can be sent to jail for up to a year if they refuse to comply with an order. But we could not find any evidence that anyone had been sent to jail. A case against the Liberty Ridge Farm, a New York wedding venue that refused to host a wedding for a lesbian couple, remains pending. Lisa Hardaway, spokeswoman for Lambda Legal in New York, said she had never heard of jail time in such a case. ""This is an extreme scare tactic by opponents of equality for LGBT folks,"" she told PolitiFact in an email. ""It's a good talking point but not real."" Other cases that remain pending are in Washington state and New Mexico, where a photographer’s case is before the state Supreme Court. Our ruling After the Supreme Court rulings about gay marriage, Perkins said, ""We're already seeing bakers and florists and photographers forced to participate in same-sex marriages under the threat of law and in some cases even jail."" We didn't find cases where people were forced to participate against their will. However, if vendors refuse service, there are consequences. There are 21 states that forbid discrimination based on sexual orientation. Vendors who refuse service there could face legal actions and fines. The ""jail"" part of Perkins’ claim is an exaggeration. We couldn’t find any evidence that a vendor had been sent to jail or that any legal authority had threatened jail time. In some states, if a business owner loses an anti-discrimination case and refuses to comply with an order, the owner could face jail, but we found no evidence of that ever happening. One state, Colorado, specifically took action to remove the threat of jail",Half True,"July 8, 2013"
"""People want the minimum wage, they want marriage equality, they want women’s health care. There’s issues that actually that really do matter, social issues that matter to the people of this state. So I know Barbara would support those issues, I know the governor hasn’t. You’ve seen the actions he’s taken on them.""","
  
When it comes to rallying support for minimum wage, marriage equality and women’s health care, Gov. Chris Christie is very far apart from Democrats on those key issues, according to state Senate President Steve Sweeney (D-Gloucester). 
Sweeney emphasized the divide in a recent interview during the June 1 episode of ‘On The Record with Michael Aron’ on NJTV. 
""People want the minimum wage, they want marriage equality, they want women’s health care,"" Sweeney said. ""There’s issues that actually that really do matter, social issues that matter to the people of this state. So I know Barbara would support those issues, I know the governor hasn’t. You’ve seen the actions he’s taken on them."" Sweeney last week endorsed Barbara Buono, a Democratic state senator from Metuchen, in November’s gubernatorial contest with Christie. 
For this fact check we’re looking only at the claim that Christie doesn’t support these issues -- concerns that PolitiFact New Jersey has addressed previously. What we have determined is that while Christie sees these issues differently than Democrats, it’s not quite true that he doesn’t support them at all. 
Let’s look back at claims on each topic, starting with minimum wage. 
In January Christie vetoed a Democratic proposal raising the minimum wage from $7.25 to $8.50 an hour, with future increases tied to inflation. So he didn’t support the Democrat proposal -- but he offered an alternative that Democrats reject: phase in a $1 increase over three years and eliminate automatic hikes. 
Next, marriage equality. 
Christie, a Catholic, has said repeatedly that same-sex marriage goes against his beliefs, but has said he supports civil unions and ensuring that same-sex couples have the same legal protections as married couples. Back in February, Christie conditionally vetoed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage and suggested a referendum on gay marriage for the Nov. 5 general election. 
That suggestion drew fire after several lawmakers, including Sweeney, said same-sex marriage is a civil rights issue and doesn’t belong on a ballot. 
Finally, let’s look at where Christie stands on women’s health care. 
State Sen. Loretta Weinberg (D-Bergen) in May 2011 claimed that six of New Jersey’s 58 family planning centers closed after Christie stripped $7.5 million in funding for the centers from his first budget for fiscal year 2011. 
Representatives of those clinics previously told us that state funding cuts forced the closures. 
Christie has since rejected at least three efforts by the Legislature to restore the family planning funding that he cut, noting on several occasions that New Jersey residents have access to ""comprehensive reproductive health care services"" at other sites and the state can’t afford to ""provide duplicative funding for family planning centers."" The centers that closed were in rural parts of South Jersey. 
To recap, the governor proposed an alternative to the Democrats’ proposal on minimum wage that would mean a smaller hike for low-income earners; opposes same-sex marriage personally but suggested it be a matter for public referendum; and cut funding for women’s health care, saying family planning services were available elsewhere. 
""That’s 100 percent accurate in terms of the distortions and outright misrepresentations of the Governor’s positions that have been repeated over and over by the Buono campaign and its allies,"" Christie for Governor campaign spokesman Kevin Roberts said in an e-mail. ""Unfortunately it’s not a surprising tactic from an increasingly desperate campaign that continues to fall further and further behind."" 
Senate Democrats spokesman Chris Donnelly could not be reached for comment. 
Our ruling 
Sweeney said, ""People want the minimum wage, they want marriage equality, they want women’s health care,"" Sweeney said during the June 1 episode of ‘On The Record with Michael Aron.’ ""There’s issues that actually that really do matter, social issues that matter to the people of this state. So I know Barbara would support those issues, I know the governor hasn’t. You’ve seen the actions he’s taken on them."" 
We’ve determined that Christie appears to support a minimum-wage hike, albeit one that is quite a bit smaller than the one supported by Democrats; opposes gay marriage, but supports civil unions and letting voters decide the matter via referendum; and cut funding for that women’s health care that closed six family planning centers in the state",Mostly True,"June 23, 2013"
"""Seventy percent of the people in the state of New Jersey want marriage equality.""","
There’s no denying that support for same-sex marriage has grown in New Jersey during the past few years. 
Polls done on the issue show that support for it has climbed above 50 percent and is nearing a two-thirds majority, according to recent results released by a handful of major polling organizations. 
The consenus is so strong, according to Senate President Steve Sweeney (D-Gloucester), that New Jersey may be headed toward a number indicating support from three-quarters of state residents. 
""Seventy percent of the people in the state of New Jersey want marriage equality,"" Sweeney said during an interview earlier this month on NJTV’s ‘On The Record with Michael Aron.’ Sweeney, who abstained when a same-sex marriage bill came before the Legislature three years ago, now supports it. 
The 70 percent figure would be the highest level of support for same-sex marriage ever polled in New Jersey – if it were true. But it’s not. 
Let’s begin by reviewing polls done in New Jersey on same-sex marriage. 
Back in April, the Rutgers-Eagleton poll asked 819 registered voters if they would vote for legalizing same-sex marriage if the question appeared on a ballot. Of those who answered, 62 percent said yes, 30 percent said no and 8 percent were undecided, said David Redlawsk, director of the Rutgers-Eagleton Polling Institute and a political science professor at Rutgers University. 
The poll had a margin of error of +/- 3.7 percent. 
We then checked with the Quinnipiac Polling Institute, which had a slightly higher approval rating for this question asked in March: Would you support or oppose a law that would allow same-sex couples to get married? 
The poll found 64 percent of registered voters in favor, the highest level Quinnipiac has seen in response to that exact question since 2006, when support was at 41 percent. Thirty percent were opposed. 
The same poll found that 72 percent of New Jerseyans say it’s a good idea to decide the same-sex marriage issue by referendum on the November ballot. 
Let’s be clear: Sweeney’s claim of 70 percent support only rings true when voters are asked if same-sex marriage should go on the ballot. Favorability for same-sex marriage is closer to 60 percent when voters are asked if they would support laws allowing it. 
Quinnipiac’s poll surveyed 1,129 registered voters and had a margin of error of +/-2.9 percent. 
The Monmouth University Poll also has polled on this topic and seen numbers near 60 percent that support same-sex marriage, with favorability increasing each year. 
""There has been a significant uptick in the last year or two,"" said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Poll. ""We’re at the point now where we’re at a solid majority."" 
Murray cited a number of reasons for the increase, including President Barack Obama publicly stating his support in May 2012 for same-sex marriage. 
""It was naturally going in that direction,"" Murray said. ""When the president made his statement it kind of cemented that. We saw an immediate uptick in African-American support."" 
But even as that support grows, neither Redlawsk nor Murray said they’ve seen approval numbers hitting the 70 percent mark claimed by Sweeney. Quinnipiac also hasn’t seen support that high. 
We also looked at other polls to gauge national support and those numbers didn’t approach 70 percent, either. 
A May Gallup poll found that 53 percent of Americans said the law should recognize same-sex marriage, marking the third time Gallup has measured a reading above 50 percent on the issue. The poll surveyed 1,535 adults nationwide and had a margin of error of +/- 3 percent. 
The poll asked: Do you think marriages between same-sex couples should or should not be recognized by the law as valid, with the same rights as traditional marriages? 
An October Pew Research Center poll, done two weeks before the November 2012 general election, found different regions of the country had widely disparate attitudes on same-sex marriage. 
Mid-Atlantic states (Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington, DC) favored same-sex marriage 57 percent to 34 percent, the poll showed. New England states had the highest level of support, at 62 percent. 
Chris Donnelly, a spokesman for New Jersey Senate Democrats who responded to our initial request for comment from Sweeney, did not answer our question about the source of Sweeney’s number. 
Our ruling 
Sweeney said during a recent TV interview, ""Seventy percent of the people in the state of New Jersey want marriage equality."" 
It’s clear that support for same-sex marriage is growing, but it’s not at the level mentioned by Sweeney. A number of polls on the topic cite support ranging from just below 60 percent to a high of 64 percent, and two New Jersey polling directors say they have never seen support levels for same-sex marriage hit 70 percent. National polls also indicate lower support levels",False,"June 16, 2013"
Says Sam Houston opposed slavery and as governor said Texas should not leave the union over slavery.,"
As the Texas-headquartered Boy Scouts of America moved closer to a vote on allowing openly gay members, Texas Gov. Rick Perry revisited his opposition to such a change, while calling for leadership that hews to principles even when they are unpopular. 
Speaking May 6, 2013, via video as part of the national, conservative Family Research Council’s ""Stand With Scouts Sunday"" webcast, Perry cited the example of Sam Houston, Texas’ first president and seventh governor, whose portrait hung behind Perry on a wall in the Governor’s Mansion. 
""From this library that I speak, he made a powerful decision that cost him his governorship,"" Perry said. ""He was against slavery, and he stood up and very passionately said, you know, ‘Texas does not need to leave the Union over this issue of slavery. We need to stay. We’ve only been’ -- he thought, a terrible decision. He was right. But it cost him his governorship."" 
That’s ""the kind of principled leadership"" we need today, said Perry, a former Eagle Scout who wrote a 2008 book defending the organization’s ""American values"" and saying it was the object of an anti-religious ""cultural war"" being waged to force the inclusion of gays, agnostics and atheists. 
His comments touched off an Internet flurry of debate over whether opposing slavery could or should be equated with opposing gay admission, but we wondered about the underlying facts. Did Sam Houston, the leader of Texas’ military insurrection against Mexico, oppose slavery and say Texas shouldn’t split from the United States over it? 
Houston did lose his job as governor over secession, ending a career of representing Texans in elected office almost continuously from the Texas Revolution to the start of the Civil War. The military hero of San Jacinto became the first president of the Republic of Texas in 1836; then a representative in the Republic’s legislature; president a second time; U.S. senator when Texas became a state in 1845; and, finally, governor starting in 1859. 
But Texas’ secession convention removed Houston as governor March 18, 1861, after he refused to sign an oath of loyalty to the Confederate States of America. Historians have written that Houston’s views on secession had earlier cost him his seat in the U.S. Senate. 
As a senator, according to the Texas State Historical Association’s Handbook of Texas, Houston angered pro-slavery factions by voting in 1848 to prohibit slavery in Oregon; supporting the delicately balanced slavery/anti-slavery decisions in the Compromise of 1850; and opposing, in 1854, the Kansas-Nebraska Act that let territories decide their own slavery status, repealing previous law that banned slavery north of latitude 36°30'. 
What guided Houston’s thinking in these disputes was his belief in the ""glorious Union"" he had worked hard to get Texas into. The Handbook says, ""As senator, Houston emerged as an ardent Unionist ... a stand that made him an increasingly controversial figure. He stridently opposed the rising sectionalism of the antebellum period and delivered eloquent speeches on the issue."" 
Perry spokesman Josh Havens referred us to the 2004 biography ""Sam Houston,"" in which author James Haley described Houston the politician as treading a fine line on slavery for decades: ""He disliked it,"" Haley wrote, but ""recognized it as a fact of life to be dealt with."" 
Via email, Haley told us, ""Gov. Perry is right that Houston was against slavery, but as a Southern senator he was chained to it and could not openly oppose it."" 
Haley pointed us to a key speech by Houston on slavery, delivered Feb. 22, 1855, in Boston, in which the senator said the Union should not be sundered for ""political opinions,"" that slavery was natural to the Southern economy and that the North would still have slaves if it were profitable there. Emancipation, Houston said, would cast the freed man into jobless destitution: ""You might call him free, but he would be an object of want and wretchedness."" 
Haley wrote, ""To Sam Houston, what was paramount at that time, and in that place, and during that crisis was keeping the Union together."" 
Houston’s personal views on slavery are unclear. He was a slaveowner; according to his biography online at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, an inventory of his property upon his death in 1863 listed ""12 slaves valued at $10,530.20."" 
Yet ""almost all acts other than his ownership of slaves support the idea that he disagreed with slavery as an institution,"" the university biography said. Among examples given: ""While in office as president of the Republic of Texas and later as governor, he refused to permit payments to bounty hunters of escaped slaves. He also prohibited slave ships from trafficking in Texas."" 
One of Houston’s slaves recalled hearing him speak against the institution on the day Abraham Lincoln was elected president. In the 1940 memoir ""My Master,"" Jeff Hamilton said, ""I heard the General say that slavery was a damnable thing at best, and that he didn’t believe in human slavery nor in secession or disunion either. He said he hoped God might in some way perform a miracle as of old and save the country from destruction."" 
After Houston had helped shepherd Texas into the United States, he spoke publicly and often against ripping the Union apart over slavery. His pro-Union views and Senate votes made him anathema in Southern politics. 
His Senate career, the Handbook of Texas says, ""was effectively ended when, in 1855, the Texas Legislature officially condemned his position on the Kansas-Nebraska Act,"" which Houston opposed ""because it allowed the status of slavery to be determined by popular sovereignty, a concept he saw as potentially destabilizing to the nation."" 
Somewhat of a lame-duck senator, Houston returned to Texas and ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1857. Opponent Hardin Runnels advocated reopening the slave trade with Africa, which Houston had called an ""unholy and cruel traffic"" as Texas’ president. Houston was portrayed as a traitor to the South; the press accused him of ""voting against all bills in the interest of slavery,"" according to a July 1914 analysis in the Southwestern Historical Quarterly that summed up his defeat: ""The people had not yet forgiven Houston for his support of the Kansas-Nebraska bill."" 
Before leaving Washington for good, Houston defended his Kansas-Nebraska vote in March 19, 1858, remarks to the Senate: ""I was not the enemy of slavery, nor was I its propagandist, nor will I ever be."" 
Houston ran for governor again as a pro-slavery candidate, according to T.R. Fehrenbach’s 2000 ""Lone Star: A History Of Texas And The Texans"": 
In 1859, Houston, now past his sixty-fifth year, determined to appeal to the people once again. His platform was clear: he supported slavery, he supported the Constitution, but he pledged allegiance to the Union, come what may. It was not a popular platform, but Houston could not believe that the Texans were prepared to forsake the greater nation he had done so much to build. 

From the gubernatorial pulpit, Houston kept arguing against secession on practical grounds. 
In a Sept. 22, 1860, speech in Austin, Houston said slavery was not threatened if Southern states stayed in the Union: ""We still have the institution of slavery. All the legislation on the subject for the past twenty years has been to secure it to us, so long as we may want it."" 
Civil war would destroy the Southern states, he said, and there was no need for secession: ""Are our rights invaded and no government ready to protect them? No! Are our institutions wrested from us and others foreign to our taste forced upon us?  No!  … if the battle is to be fought for the Constitution, let us fight it in the Union and for the sake of the Union."" 
The institution of slavery ""is our own,"" Houston said, ""and the North has nothing to do with it. The North does not want it, and we have nothing to do with that. … We have the right to abolish slavery -- they have the right to establish it. It is in our interest to have it. Climate, soil, association -- all make the institution peculiarly suited to us. If it were to their interest, the people of the North would have it."" 
In a Nov. 14, 1860, open letter to residents of Huntsville who wrote to seek his advice on secession, Houston said a revolution should not be launched without ""some more weighty reason for overthrowing the Government, than rash enthusiasts have yet given."" 
As Texas moved toward secession, Houston told the Legislature in a Jan. 21, 1861, message that the slave states should be able to keep their rights, but ""hasty"" action could be disastrous for cash-strapped Texas. ""The millions now spent by the United States, the support of our postal service, the defense of our commerce, must all come from the pockets of our people."" 
Houston’s appeals failed, but Lincoln was impressed by his courage and according to the Texas State Library’s web site ""made secret contact with him through intermediaries, offering the old general command of 50,000 troops and the rank of major general if he would lead a force to restore federal control of Texas."" 
Houston turned down the offer in a March 29, 1861, letter; some accounts say he sat up late into the night discussing the question with friends in the mansion’s library and then dropped Lincoln’s offer into the fire. 
We asked Havens for reaction to our findings, and asked whether the Lincoln offer or another event was the ""powerful decision"" Perry had referred to. Haley’s book mentions a ""family tradition"" that says Houston paced the mansion’s floors all night before refusing to sign the Confederate oath. 
Havens said, ""Gov. Perry was referencing Gov. Houston’s strength of character, standing up for what he believed was right in the face of public opposition. There were a collection of events that occurred over that period of time, including burning Lincoln’s letter in the mansion library, when Houston was pondering an issue that would not only shape the fate of our state, but also his personal future."" 
Houston did not live to see the war’s end; he left Austin to return to Huntsville, where he died of pneumonia on July 26, 1863, at age 70.
  
Our ruling 
Perry said his long-ago predecessor ""was against slavery, and he stood up and very passionately said, you know, ‘Texas does not need to leave the Union over this issue of slavery.’ "" 
Houston’s personal views are unclear; politically, he took actions that were viewed as anti-slavery as well as actions that were pro-slavery. 
But he did exhort Southerners and his fellow Texans not to secede over slavery -- an unpopular stance he stuck to in hopes of preserving the Union he revered",Half True,"May 22, 2013"
"""In 29 states in this country you can still get fired for not just being gay, but if your employer thinks you are gay.""","
One of the biggest news stories of last week came from the world of sports, with NBA player Jason Collins becoming the first active male athlete playing for a major U.S. team sport to come out as gay. Several Sunday public-affairs shows tried to put Collins’ declaration into historical context. 
CBS’ Face the Nation invited retired tennis great Martina Navratilova, among others, to discuss its significance. Navratilova came out as gay more than three decades ago. 
""I think when President (Barack) Obama came in favor of … gay marriage, that really changed the tide. But we have to remember that this has been a long time coming,"" she said. ""We still don't have equal rights. I have been getting (questions) on Twitter, ‘Why does this matter? I don't care.’ Which is kind of code for, ‘I really don't want to know.’ But it does matter because in 29 states in this country you can still get fired for not just being gay but if your employer thinks you are gay. ... We don't have equal rights."" 
We wondered whether Navratilova was correct that ""in 29 states in this country you can still get fired for not just being gay, but if your employer thinks you are gay."" 
According to the Human Rights Campaign, a gay-rights group, 21 states plus the District of Columbia explicitly prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. The remaining 29 do not. (This map shows the legal situation by state.) 
We should note that the 29 states in question are defined by the absence of a law prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation, rather than the presence of a law allowing such discrimination. This means employees in these states who believe they are discriminated against would not have grounds to win a lawsuit alleging discrimination. The group said that it’s possible for an employer to discriminate based on the perception, rather than the fact, that someone is gay. 
But while Navratilova gets the number right, our discussions with legal experts produced a few exceptions to the rule: 
• Government employees in those states have protections. Government workers are covered by the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. A public employee can establish a violation if they can show they were subjected to adverse treatment when compared with other similarly situated employees, and that the treatment was motivated by an intention to discriminate on the basis of improper considerations, according to Lambda Legal Defense, a legal organization focused on challenging discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals. Courts have backed the idea that sexual orientation is one of the categories that would permit such a lawsuit. 
In addition, nine other states -- beyond the 21 that currently ban discrimination based on sexual orientation -- have an executive order, administrative order or personnel regulation that prohibits such discrimination against public employees, according to the Human Rights Campaign. 
• Localities may have an anti-discrimination law even if their state does not. To give just one example, Pennsylvania has no statewide law, but many of its cities do, from Philadelphia and Pittsburgh all the way down to Jenkintown and Susquehanna Township, according to the Pennsylvania Diversity Network. According to the group, 12 of the 15 most populous cities in the Keystone State have anti-discrimination laws that cover sexual orientation, meaning a sizable percentage of employees in the state are covered even without a state law. 
• Individual employers may have policies that bar discrimination based on sexual orientation, even if their state or city does not. ""Some employers, through union agreements, company handbooks or other contracts, may have explicitly or implicitly promised to refrain from certain kinds of discrimination, and these provisions, depending on the particulars, might protect some employees against irrational discrimination of this kind,"" said Vik Amar, a law professor at the University of California at Davis. 
• Title VII of the Civil Rights Act provides protection for employees who are subjected to gender-based stereotyping. This is relevant because Navratilova said you could get fired ""if your employer thinks you are gay"" -- not just if you are actually gay. While the Civil Rights Act currently protects only sex discrimination and not discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender-based stereotyping can include elements that overlap significantly with an employer ""think(ing) you are gay."" 
Hayley Gorenberg, deputy legal director of Lambda Legal, cited the 1989 Supreme Court case Price Waterhouse vs. Hopkins. In that case, a woman sued the accounting firm where she worked because she was not offered a promotion after a senior manager told her she should ""walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear make-up, have her hair styled, and wear jewelry."" The plaintiff convinced the court that sex stereotyping constitutes sex discrimination, Gorenberg said. This precedent could protect a straight person who appeared to an employer to be ""gay"" and suffered discrimination as a result. 
Gorenberg said that despite these exceptions, Navratilova has a point. She said that calls to her group’s national legal help line include a ""very high percentage"" of workplace discrimination complaints. ""Without specific national protection, people are fired based on their sexual orientation far more easily,"" she said. 
Our ruling 
Navratilova said, ""In 29 states in this country you can still get fired for not just being gay, but if your employer thinks you are gay."" If you frame this statement in the context of blanket protections by states, she’s correct. Still, even in those 29 states, many gay and lesbian employees do have protections, either because they work for the government, because they live in a city that bars such discrimination, or because they work for a company that has pledged not to discriminate based on sexual orientation",Half True,"May 7, 2013"
The decision to remove Chick-fil-A from Emory University was based solely on student feedback.,"
Emory University’s newspaper, The Emory Wheel, reported last month that the university will boot Chick-fil-A off campus this summer. 
The move comes after Chick-fil-A President Dan Cathy last year angered supporters of same-sex marriage. David Furhman, the senior director of Emory’s Food Service Administration, told the Wheel that the decision to remove Chick-fil-A was not spurred by the Cathy controversy. It was, he said, based solely on student feedback from surveys and focus groups. 
""What we learned was that there was no great affinity or love for Chick-fil-A,"" Furhman said in a March 12 article in the Wheel. ""It was more of an affinity or love of the convenience, and what students also told us was that they didn’t really love Chick-fil-A."" 
PolitiFact Georgia wondered: Was Emory's decision triggered solely by focus-group feedback? 
And we wanted to know what that feedback included. 
The conflict began when Cathy discussed same-sex marriage in a July 2012 interview. 
""I think we are inviting God's judgment on our nation when we shake our fist at Him and say, 'We know better than you as to what constitutes a marriage,'"" Cathy said. 
Critics called for boycotts. Supporters rallied to Cathy’s defense, organizing a ""Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day"" that packed eateries. 
Chick-fil-A, which began in metro Atlanta and is headquartered here, did not respond to an interview request. 
Emory groups, including gay rights organizations and the Student Government Association, formally requested the removal of Chick-fil-A after the controversy began. Senior Director and Dean of Campus Life Ajay Nair released a statement saying the university wouldn’t remove the eatery based on Cathy’s comments. 
But in February, the university and a student committee called FACE (Food Administration Committee Emory) said they were going to review all campus food venues, including Chick-fil-A. 
Furhman told the Wheel that the examination of the campus food venues where Chick-fil-A is located predated the controversy. But both student co-chairs of FACE contradicted that. They said the review plan began when Furhman joined Emory in January. 
PolitiFact contacted Furhman, who referred all inquiries to Campus Communications. He declined to answer our questions. 
Nair said in the Wheel: ""Through (dialogue over Chick-fil-A), we also learned that a re-visioning of dining at Emory could foster a separate, positive community change, while addressing students’ concerns around their dining experiences."" 
One student co-chair of the food committee, Karoline Porcello, told the Wheel the restaurant’s values were a contributing, but not deciding factor in its removal. In an email, Porcello clarified that those values referred to ""human development values"" such as physical well-being, not political values. 
After PolitiFact Georgia reached out to Campus Communications, Porcello said: ""We've received strict instructions by Emory to no longer comment on the issue."" 
Michael Sacks, another co-chair, said the removal was not political. 
""It’s kind of unfortunate that people very easily jump to the conclusion that Chick-fil-A’s political views were the reason we got rid of them, but that was not our intention at all,"" Sacks told WSB Radio. 
The process reviewed each venue according to six criteria, including consistency with the campus life department’s core values and survey data. 
The committee held open monthly meetings and focus groups with more than 30 volunteer attendees who answered FACE’s questions. In all three of the monthly meeting documents on the FACE website, Chick-fil-A was not mentioned. 
Sacks sent over three of the four focus groups’ minutes. He said that he was told that the last meeting ""did not present much opportunity for note-taking."" 
The three focus group minutes didn’t conclusively show a distaste for Chick-fil-A. Some attendees said they eat at Chick-fil-A often while others showed distaste for the venue. One document even said ""Keep Chick-fil-A"" in the summary box. 
Porcello said some focus group members wanted to remove Chick-fil-A for health reasons and that some said they only liked the convenience of the venue. The documents provided to PolitiFact Georgia didn’t confirm those claims. Porcello didn’t respond to requests to do so. 
In a March meeting, the food committee put three floor plans up for a vote. None of the plans included Chick-fil-A or Pizza Hut. Sacks said that decision was based on the focus groups. 
Ultimately, the redesign will replace Chick-fil-A with a pizza and pasta venue, expand Mexican food and salad areas and create a grab-and-go station and a coffee and bakery area. The committee chairs said the university will remove Pizza Hut as well. 
Dena Smith, Emory’s senior communication officer, sent PolitiFact a link to a March 12 Campus Life statement indicating that Emory would announce a final Chick-fil-A decision soon. She said Emory would consider FACE’s input, which does not include ""a chicken restaurant."" This statement was released the same day that the Wheel and WSB Radio published their stories about the venue’s closure. 
PolitiFact contacted 15 Emory political science professors for a comment. None wanted to weigh in on the controversy. 
Kennesaw State University political science professor Kerwin Swint says that it is difficult to believe that the decision wasn’t political. He said that Emory’s role as  ""ground zero"" of the Chick-fil-A debate may have something to do with its defense. 
""I’m not saying that it isn’t true,"" Swint said, ""But I work on a college campus ... and I can tell you that Chick-fil-A is probably the most popular dining option (on my campus)."" 
Our conclusion: 
An Emory administrator said that a proposal to remove Chick-fil-A from a campus dining hall was not politically motivated but was instead based on focus groups. Campus officials have offered conflicting statements about Chick-fil-A’s future. 
PolitiFact rules require the person making the statement to provide the proof to back it up. Furhman and Emory failed to do so. 
There apparently was an objective process that reviewed all food vendors, but only incomplete documentation was provided. That documentation didn’t confirm any of the sources’ claims. And the final redesign plan doesn’t indicate the committee was concentrating on health concerns. It  wants to remove Chick-fil-A, but plans call for a proposed pizza and pasta joint and expanded Mexican food areas. Not exactly healthy alternatives",Half True,"April 19, 2013"
"""The financial penalties imposed"" on gay couples ""can cost us more than $300,000 compared with married heterosexual couples over a lifetime.""","
First comes love, then comes marriage ... then comes the potential savings of a joint tax return. That’s the story for opposite-sex couples, but not necessarily for same-sex couples. 
Gay couples aren’t entitled to some of the money-saving benefits available to opposite-sex married couples. But how much lost money is it for a gay couple? 
Equality Florida, a group that advocates on behalf of the gay community, raised that topic as the U.S. Supreme Court heard two cases related to gay marriage in March: a challenge to California’s Proposition 8, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman, and a challenge to the federal Defense of Marriage Act, a 1996 law that defines marriage as between a man and a woman. (For more on the cases read PolitiFact’s primer.) 
The DOMA case stems from a financial issue involving Edith ""Edie"" Windsor, who lived with Thea Spyer for 44 years; they married in Canada in 2007. After Spyer’s death in 2009, Windsor had to pay $363,000 in taxes on her spouse’s estate rather than inheriting it outright, as mixed-gender married couples routinely do. 
Nadine Smith, executive director of Equality Florida, wrote in a press release on March 27 that she was hopeful the Supreme Court would move to end the federal ban on same-sex marriage: 
""If observers are correct, gay married couples including my wife and I will not be faced with tax forms that require us to lie and deny the existence of our spouse. The financial penalties imposed because we are considered legal strangers can cost us more than $300,000 compared with married heterosexual couples over a lifetime. In a stroke, this financial burden will be erased."" 
We wanted to research how Smith concluded that gay couples can pay $300,000 more than heterosexual couples over a lifetime. 
Cost estimates for gay couples 
In response to our questions, Smith sent us media reports that mentioned various higher costs for gay couples ranging from taxes, to renting a car to divorce. 
The most in-depth analysis came from the New York Times, which spent two months in 2009 calculating the added costs of being a gay couple over a lifetime, including taxes, health insurance, pensions, having a child and other expenses. 
For the tax portion, the New York Times received assistance from Roberton Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The analysis created a fictitious couple in New York, gave them two kids and assumed one parent would stay home for five years to take care of them. The analysis took factors into account based on three states with large gay populations: Florida, New York and California. (The New York Times provided  25 pages of details on how they arrived at the calculations.) 
The newspaper calculated two separate scenarios, both starting when the couples were 35. In the first scenario, one partner earned $110,000 and the other $30,000; in the second, each earned $70,000. 
The conclusion: the worst-case scenario over a couple’s lifetime was $467,562. But that fell to $41,196 in the best-case scenario, for a couple with better health insurance and lower taxes. The numbers varied depending on income and other factors. 
""For wealthy couples with a lot of assets, on the other hand, the cost of being gay could easily spiral into the millions,"" the New York Times wrote. 
One of the reporters who wrote the story, Tara Siegel-Bernard, and two of the experts consulted for that story told PolitiFact Florida that the dollar figures in 2009 would change in 2013. But without thoroughly redoing the analysis, it was hard to assess by how much. 
One key factor that has changed since then is that in 2011, New York passed a law allowing same-sex marriage. The couple could now file a joint state income tax return, which may or may not save a gay couple money. There have also been some health insurance changes. 
Even if the Supreme Court strikes down DOMA, it won’t erase all the financial and legal hurdles for gay couples, the New York Times wrote. For example, many couples would still have to travel to another state to get married. 
""It is hard to present any sort of average -- people are in very different situations for all the reasons you noted,"" said Lee Badgett, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts who has studied gay marriage. 
We sent Equality Florida’s claim to the the National Organization for Marriage, a group that opposes gay marriage. The group’s political director Frank Schubert also noted that the New York Times analysis was built on multiple assumptions. 
Schubert disagreed with some assumptions. ""For example, in one of the scenarios the New York Times assumed that the same-sex couple would not receive any health coverage for one of the partners for the entire duration of their 50-year relationship. Many companies already provide health coverage for domestic partners, and this percentage is growing rapidly. Policy makers could address this issue without redefining marriage. Similarly, the analysis was conducted before New York redefined marriage, which makes the state tax calculations moot."" 
We asked Smith in an email why she cited the $300,000 figure. 
""I guess I could have said more than $400,000 but I was being conservative. Edie Windsor was forced to pay $363,000 because her marriage was not recognized, so it is number that is familiar to the general public. In addition, Florida is the least hospitable of the three states used in the modeling: Florida, New York and California."" 
 Parenting among gay couples is more common in the South than other regions of the country, ""so we are seeing the additional costs add up,"" wrote Smith, who along with her wife is raising a son. (They married in Vermont.) 
Our ruling 
Nadine Smith, the director of Equality Florida, said, ""The financial penalties imposed"" on gay couples ""can cost us more than $300,000 compared with married heterosexual couples over a lifetime."" 
Smith said ""penalties"" are ""imposed"" on same-sex couples. Actually, it's more accurate to say that they don't have access to the same benefits as opposite-sex couples. 
On the question of numbers, is it possible that for some gay couples, the cost would add up to $300,000 over a lifetime? The key here is that word ""can."" It is difficult to come up with an average because the taxes, health insurance and expenses vary from couple to couple depending on where they live and other factors. The most extensive analysis we saw from the New York Times calculated a range between about $41,196 and $467,562 in 2009. 
The $300,000 cited by Smith falls within that range but requires some explanation",Mostly True,"April 8, 2013"
"Assertions that it makes no difference whether children are raised by heterosexual or homosexual parents have been ""shattered by the latest and best social science and research.""","
Supporters and opponents of bills to legalize same-sex marriage argued for more than 12 straight hours recently before the Rhode Island Senate’s Judiciary Committee. One of the many issues on which they disagreed was the consequences, if any, of same-sex couples raising children. 
""It's true some people claim that it doesn't make a difference whether a child is raised by a mother and father or whether she's raised by adults engaged in homosexual lifestyles,"" said Susan Yoshihara, director of research at the Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute, who testified against same-sex marriage. 
""Some go even further and say that two lesbians might make better parents than a mother and a father, and there was a study that came out a few years ago that pointed to that effect as well. But any scholarly basis for those claims has been shattered by the latest and best social science and research."" 
We wondered what recent research she was referring to and whether it really ""shattered"" previous findings. 
First, some background. According to the 2010 Census, there were 131,729 same-sex married households and 514,735 unmarried same-sex households in the United States. 
Thirty-one percent of the married couples and almost 14 percent of the unmarried couples said they were raising children. Nearly 2 million children under age 18 were being raised by at least one gay or lesbian parent, the census estimated. 
There have been numerous peer-reviewed studies of same-sex couples raising children. 
Supporters of same-sex marriage say one of the best grew out of the National Longitudinal Lesbian Family Study, which, since 1986, has been following 154 lesbian mothers who had children through artificial insemination. 
Researchers questioned 39 boys and 39 girls raised by those couples and compared responses with those of equal numbers of boys and girls raised by a mother and father. Their findings were published in 2012 in the Journal of Developmental & Behavioral Pediatrics. 
""Our results revealed that the [children of the lesbian couples] rated themselves comparably to their counterparts in opposite-sex parent families in"" quality of life, the study concluded. 
In March 2013, the 60,000-member American Academy of Pediatrics announced it supports same-sex marriage. In its journal, Pediatrics, it said that ""extensive data from more than 30 years of research reveal that children raised by gay and lesbian parents have demonstrated resilience with regard to social, psychological, and sexual health despite economic and legal disparities and social stigma."" 
SO WHAT WAS the research that, according to Yoshihara, changed the landscape of scholarly thinking on the issue, shattering the past studies? 
We contacted Yoshihara, who provided links to two recent studies. 
One was by Mark Regnerus, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Texas-Austin. 
Regnerus’ study, published in July 2012 in Social Science Research, asserted that many previous studies finding ""no notable disadvantages"" and/or ""no differences"" for children raised in same-sex families relied on sample sizes that were too small or were biased. And he said they often relied on interviews of the same-sex parents, not the children. 
Regnerus’  New Family Structures Study used a questionnaire on a range of topics to interview just under 3,000 people ages 18 to 39 and asserted that some outcomes were worse for children of same-sex parents. It compared the children of ""lesbian mothers"" and ""gay fathers"" with the children of ""intact"" heterosexual couples. 
The study looked at everything from whether the children had thought about suicide to whether they voted in the last presidential election. It found, for instance, that the children of lesbian mothers were more likely to be have been in therapy, a link that was not true for children of gay fathers. 
Yoshihara also cited a paper by Loren Marks, a professor at Louisiana State University, which Social Science Research also published online in July 2012, which raised similar criticisms of previous studies. 
THE REGNERUS STUDY'S methods and conclusions touched off a firestorm of criticism from same-sex marriage supporters and from social scientists from around the country. 
Two hundred researchers signed a letter to Social Science Research, attacking the ""intellectual merit"" of the Regnerus study. 
James D. Wright, editor-in-chief of Social Science Research, asked yet another scholar on the journal’s editorial board to review the Regnerus study and determine whether it was proper to have published it. 
That scholar, Darren E. Sherkat, a Southern Illinois University sociology professor, found many shortcomings. Among them: the Regnerus study included among its gay parents people who had a same-sex relationship at any time, even if it was one experience and even if the people involved did not raise the child together. 
Sherkat was also asked to review the companion paper by Marks and he concluded it was essentially a review of other studies and ""inappropriate for a journal that published original quantitative research."" 
Sherkat also found that reviewers of both papers failed to disclose conflicts of interest, including being paid consultants on the Regnerus study. 
""Both papers have serious flaws and distortions that were not simply ignored, but lauded in the reviews,"" Sherkat wrote. 
Meanwhile, 27 scholars from various universities signed a letter defending the Regnerus study. 
SO WHERE ARE WE in this academic free-for-all? 
Two things are clear: 
* There is a sharp division among scholars and advocates over the issue of same-sex parenting 
* The Regnerus study hasn’t been widely accepted as ""the best"" research on the topic and has not reordered the social-science world in the way Yoshihara suggests. 

Wright, the Social Science Research editor-in-chief, put it best: 
""I would regard ‘shattered by the latest and best social science research’ as something of an overstatement,"" he said in an e-mail 
A prudent scholar, he said, would conclude that ""the question is by no means settled, either by the literature as a whole or by the Regnerus study, the latter having far too many problems and issues to be considered ‘definitive",False,"April 7, 2013"
"""Any legislative action that is taken now could very well be rendered completely null and void by the decision of the Supreme Court expected this June.""","
With two same-sex marriage cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and two competing bills that would legalize same-sex marriage now before the Rhode Island Senate Judiciary Committee, Roman Catholic Bishop Thomas Tobin issued a statement March 27 urging state legislators to delay any action. 
Tobin, who leads the Diocese of Providence, has strongly opposed same-sex marriage. 
""In light of the historic deliberations of the U.S. Supreme Court on same-sex marriage, it would be appropriate for the General Assembly of Rhode Island to defer any action on this critical issue for the time being,"" Tobin said. ""Any legislative action that is taken now could very well be rendered completely null and void by the decision of the Supreme Court expected this June. It is likely that the Supreme Court will decide this matter for us, one way or another. Let's wait to see what the highest court of the land says about this issue which is so very important to many Rhode Islanders."" 
We were interested in Tobin’s assertion that any legislative action that is taken now by the General Assembly might become ""completely null and void"" after the Supreme Court's ruling on its two cases. 
We asked Tobin’s office for an explanation. His spokesman said the bishop was out of town and unavailable. 
So we started making inquiries. 
The first Rhode Island proposal would, as a matter of law, replace the civil same-sex unions already legal in Rhode Island with same-sex marriage. That proposal has already passed the Rhode Island House. 
The second, if approved by the General Assembly and signed by the governor, would call for a referendum on whether to enshrine same-sex marriage into the Rhode Island Constitution, a document that doesn't mention marriage at all. 
Supporters of same-sex marriage oppose this bill, in part, because it includes protections for businesses that would refuse, on religious grounds, to provide goods and services for same-sex ceremonies. 
We asked legal experts on both sides of the debate whether any action by the U.S. Supreme Court in the two cases it is considering could nullify action by the Rhode Island legislature. All said that passage of either Rhode Island bill would not be affected by a Supreme Court ruling. 
That's because neither bill is proposing to make same-sex marriage illegal. The Supreme Court, in contrast, is weighing the constitutionality of bans on same-sex marriages, said Jesse Choper, professor of public law at the University of California Berkeley School of Law. 
In the case heard March 26, the issue was whether a successful voter initiative passed in California, known as Proposition 8, can lawfully ban same-sex marriages in that state. 
In the case heard the next day, the issue was whether the federal Defense of Marriage Act, commonly called DOMA, is discriminatory because, like the California law, it  restricts the definition of marriage to a union between one man and one woman. DOMA denies federal benefits to same-sex couples. 
""There is absolutely no chance that the Supreme Court will nullify a Rhode Island law adopting same-sex marriage, either by referendum or by action of the General Assembly,"" said Jared Goldstein, professor of law at Roger Williams University School of Law. 
""The issue in the two cases before the Supreme Court this term is whether laws against same-sex marriage violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection, not whether laws allowing same-sex marriage violate the Constitution,"" he said in an e-mail. 
David S. Cohen, a constitutional law and gender issues expert at Drexel University in Philadelphia, agreed: ""Rhode Island still has every reason to go forward if they want marriage equality,"" he said. 
  
If the Supreme Court were to broadly rule in the Proposition 8 case that it is unconstitutional to deny same-sex couples the right to marry -- a ruling most of our experts said seems unlikely given comments made by the justices during oral arguments -- that ""would legalize same-sex marriage in every state across the country no matter what the state is currently doing,"" Cohen said. A ruling on DOMA would only apply to federal law.  
Even if DOMA and the California proposition are upheld, ""It doesn't preclude [Rhode Island] from recognizing same-sex marriage either way,"" said Emily Sack, also a professor at Roger Williams. 
In theory, if the Supreme Court were to require every state to accept same-sex marriage, that would make the proposed referendum on the Rhode Island Constitution a meaningless ballot question. 
""If the court rules that Prop 8 is invalid because same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry in every state, the ruling would effectively block a state referendum on the subject because we don't put constitutional rights to a vote,"" said Goldstein. But ""a decision granting same-sex marriage is under no threat of Supreme Court nullification, and the only realistic threat of nullification is if Rhode Island keeps the law as it is."" 
  
Our ruling 
Bishop Thomas Tobin urged the General Assembly to delay consideration of any same-sex marriage legislation in Rhode Island because, ""Any legislative action that is taken now could very well be rendered completely null and void by the decision of the Supreme Court expected this June."" 
But the question of whether to allow same-sex marriage -- the topic of the bills being considered by the state legislature -- is not what the U.S. Supreme Court is considering. The court is looking at the constitutionality of laws intent on blocking same-sex marriage. 
That's a key difference. 
As a result, except for an unexpected decision by the court to allow same-sex marriage nationwide, approval of either General Assembly bill is not going to be affected by what the justices decide in June",False,"April 3, 2013"
"""It is legal in Ohio to fire an employee or evict a tenant just for being gay.""","
The U.S. Supreme Court put the focus on same-sex marriage when it heard cases challenging California's Proposition 8 and the federal Defense of Marriage Act, but attention elsewhere fell on a wider range of rights issues. 
The liberal advocacy group ProgressOhio Education used the opportunity to send out a fundraising email highlighting its work ""for the rights of all Ohioans"" beyond marriage. 
""Did you know,"" the email asked, ""it is legal in Ohio to fire an employee or evict a tenant just for being gay?"" 
The assertion took PolitiFact Ohio by surprise. We asked ProgressOhio for more information. 
Executive director Brian Rothenberg said the failure of state legislation prohibiting employment and housing discrimination left gay people without legal protection in those areas. 
He pointed to a recent legal case as underlining that point. 
The legislation he mentioned was the Equal Housing and Employment Act, House Bill 176, which would have added sexual orientation and gender identity to the list of classifications for which it is illegal to discriminate for housing, employment and public-accommodation purposes in Ohio. 
(It already is illegal in Ohio to discriminate against a person on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, handicap, age and ancestry.) 
Introduced in the 128th General Assembly, H.B. 176 was passed by the Ohio House in September 2009, but was never brought up for a vote in the Senate and died with the end of that legislative session. 
Similar legislation, House Bill 335, was introduced in the 129th General Assembly in October 2011. It suffered a similar fate, dying without a vote in either chamber. 
The legal case Rothenberg cited, Inskeep v. Western Reserve Transit Authority, was decided in March by Ohio's 7th District Court of Appeals. The court dismissed the suit of a man who claimed he was harassed on the job because of his sexual orientation, ruling that Ohio's employment discrimination statute does not protect ""sexual orientation."" 
The court said in its decision: ""Several states have chosen to enact legislation prohibiting discrimination against homosexuals by adding sexual orientation as a protected status in their discrimination statutes. Because Ohio has not, it has been concluded that sexual orientation is not protected."" 
We looked further and found that Ohio prohibited discrimination within state employment based on sexual orientation and gender identity under an executive order issued by then-Gov. Ted Strickland in 2007. After it expired, Gov. John Kasich issued an executive order in January 2011 prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation, but not gender identity. Both orders applied only to public employees in state jobs. 
Twenty-nine Ohio cities and counties now have anti-discrimination ordinances, according to a tally by the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. 
Ohio’s lack of protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation parallels both federal law and the law of 28 other states, according to Business Management Daily, the advocacy group Equality Ohio and the ACLU",True,"April 2, 2013"
"""Very few men outlive their own fertility.""","
Kids are at the center of marriage, argue supporters of California’s same-sex marriage ban. 
But infertile opposite-sex couples can get married, opponents point out — so why not same-sex pairs? 
Men stay fertile till their deathbeds, said an attorney arguing against rights for same-sex couples. 
Confused? 
Consider the actual debate before the Supreme Court on March 26, 2013, in Hollingsworth vs. Perry. 
Justice Elena Kagan compared a ban on marriage licenses for couples over age 55 with a ban on marriage licenses for same-sex couples. Couples over 55 are unlikely to produce children, she pointed out. Yet it would be unconstitutional to deny them a marriage license. 
So, she asked, what’s the difference between that couple and a same-sex couple that can’t naturally conceive? 
Attorney Charles Cooper, arguing in favor of California’s ban, said, ""With respect to couples over the age of 55, it is very rare that … both parties to the couple are infertile."" 
A bit later, he clarified: ""Very few men outlive their own fertility."" 
He explained that the state’s interest in marriage extends to older couples, because preserving the ""marital norm""  — with its obligations of fidelity and monogamy — discourages ""irresponsible procreative conduct outside of that marriage."" (He meant old guys having affairs with young mistresses.) 
It’s settled science that most women over 55 can’t naturally conceive. But we wondered — apart from what it may mean for the constitutionality of same-sex marriage — what does science say about men’s fertility in their declining years? 
Do ""very few men outlive their own fertility""? 
What studies say — and don’t say 
We spoke with a range of fertility experts, combed through their research, and can tell you this: Science doesn't yet tell us how many old men can make babies. 
Especially if we’re talking about natural conception of the variety that might take place if a 70-year-old is seeing a 25-year-old on the side. The kind that requires, you know, sex, and enough sperm that move vigorously enough to reach and penetrate an egg. 
(One expert told us some couples who visit fertility clinics don’t realize sex is required to make babies. We’re going to assume here that you generally get how this process works.) 
We do know that roughly 10 to 20 percent of couples generally are infertile, with the man’s fertility a factor in about 40 percent of those cases. 
But evidence is tricky when it comes to fertility as men age. 
Cooper’s office sent us links to two studies that note men make sperm late into life. But one happens to document age-related decline in sperm quality and the other notes that studies suggest men contribute to reduced fertility beginning in their early 40s. 
Here’s a roundup of points on both sides. 
Signs of late-life fertility: 
• There’s no ""cliff"" as with menopause around age 50 in women, where fertility drops off dramatically. 
• Most men still make sperm into old age, studies say. (This is different from women, who are born with all the eggs they will ever have — no making fresh ones.) 
• Sperm count, one of the most important measures of male fertility, isn’t as sensitive to age as other factors, said Andrew La Barbera, scientific director for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. 
• We’ve all heard of guys old enough to be great-grandfathers fathering kids. Or, as Justice Antonin Scalia joked in court, about the late Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who fathered four children in his late 60s and early 70s. 
Points that give pause: 
• While there’s no menopause-like fertility cliff for men, sperm quality, amount of semen and fertility do appear to decline with age. Older men may be more likely to make sperm that’s strangely shaped and doesn’t swim well. ""These data suggest that men may become progressively less fertile as they age,"" said a 2003 study cited by Cooper’s office. 
• The timing of fertility decline may vary dramatically from person to person — but there’s a need for more research to explain the variation. 
• There’s no clear research that shows how many older men may be capable of impregnating a woman in a year of regular sex, the clinical definition of fertility. 
""We don’t have data on men as they age ... not men who are in their 60s and 70s,"" said Harry Fisch, clinical professor of urology and reproductive medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College and author of The Male Biological Clock. ""Very few men in these studies are older."" 
""If it’s true, then let me ask you: Where’s the data?"" 
That point was echoed by researchers who explained the limits of current studies. 
""It is rather difficult to give a precise estimate of (men’s) fertility by age because very few are still trying to have children beyond 60 or 65 years,"" said Henri Leridon, an expert in human reproduction who headed research at France’s National Institute for Demographic Studies. 
An Israeli fertility researcher, Eliezer Girsh, told PolitiFact that not only does fertility decline in men after age 50, but that just 20 to 40 percent of men are ""still fertile in advanced age."" 
Other experts said that, frankly, there’s a need for more research. 
But anecdotes sometimes overshadow the lack of data. 
The oldest scientifically documented case of fatherhood: a 94-year-old. 
Our ruling 
Cooper argued before the Supreme Court that ""very few men outlive their own fertility."" Experts we consulted generally agree that men — or at least some men — may still father children well into their advanced years. But whether that’s most men or a minority isn’t yet supported by research. Meanwhile, emerging studies document declining fertility as individual men age, and studies don’t yet confirm how many men remain fertile their entire lives",Half True,"March 28, 2013"
"""In other jurisdictions where (a domestic partnership registry) has been enacted, we have seen that fewer people enter into marriage.""","
Florida lawmakers heard a bill that would allow couples who live together anywhere in the state to register for a domestic partnership, a designation that would afford them some of the same rights as married couples.

The outlook for SB 196 isn’t promising. Social conservatives control the Capitol, Florida voters enacted a ban on gay marriage in the state Constitution, and bill sponsor Sen. Eleanor Sobel, D-Hollywood, could not get enough votes to move her measure out of her committee.

Sobel called it the ""shacking up"" bill because it would benefit all couples, both gay and straight, who live together but choose not to marry. Sobel’s domestic partnership bill would eliminate the patchwork of 18 registries enacted by counties such as Orange, Pinellas, Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach, and cities such as St. Petersburg, Tampa, Clearwater, North Miami  and Miami Beach.

Proponents testified before the Senate Children, Families and Elder Affairs Committee on Feb. 19, 2013, sharing stories about not being able to be with their partner at the hospital because they were not married.

On the other side, members of religious groups, including Michael Sheedy, Florida Conference of Catholic Bishops public policy director, testified that the law would diminish traditional marriage.

""In other jurisdictions where this has been enacted, we have seen that fewer people enter into marriage,"" Sheedy said. ""They take it less seriously, it has less value in the minds of some.""

Sen. Jeff Clemens, D-Lake Worth, asked Sheedy for more information about his claim that the number of marriages falls in places where domestic partnerships are in place. Sheedy said Spain came to mind. Clemens pressed him for any examples in the United States, and Sheedy said he could not think of any off the top of his head.

We also wanted to know more about Sheedy’s statement. In a phone conversation the next day, he acknowledged not finding data about this happening in the United States. He did send us a few links from religious groups about the effect of gay marriage laws on traditional marriage in Spain and the Netherlands.

""While other factors such as growing unemployment played a role, there is a strong case that redefining marriage is mostly responsible for the decline,"" Sheedy said.

We wanted to examine his theory.

Declining popularity of marriage

Reports of marriage’s decline are not greatly exaggerated. Story after story has documented its waning popularity.

According to a Pew Research Center analysis of Census data, 51 percent of American adults were married and 28 percent never had been as of December 2011. In 1960, 72 percent of adults were married and 15 percent never had been. The marriage decline is strongest among young adults.

The trend is not at all isolated to Americans, Pew points out. Other post-industrial societies are seeing the same thing. Stephanie Coontz, feminist scholar and author, explored what’s behind the drop in U.S. marriages in a Los Angeles Times column in 2012:

""Fifty years ago, getting married was a step young people took on the road to becoming economically secure, emotionally responsible and socially respectable. Today, it is more often the reward couples give themselves when they have achieved those goals. The vast majority of new marriages are between couples who have already cohabited. But many cohabiting couples refuse to marry until they are convinced that each partner has demonstrated his or her economic and emotional reliability.""

The European experience

Spain and the Netherlands are countries frequently cited as examples of places where marriages declined when alternative options, in this case gay marriage, were offered.

Scandinavian countries -- Denmark, Norway, Iceland and Sweden -- were first to introduce marriage-like rights for gay couples in the late 1980s and early ‘90s. In a 2004 essay, Stanley Kurtz, of the conservative Hoover Institute at Stanford University, argued these laws hastened the decline of marriage and the family, pointing to corresponding upticks in child wedlock and cohabitation with a declining marriage rate. ""The rise of fragile families based on cohabitation and out-of-wedlock childbearing means that during the ‘90s, the total rate of family dissolution in Scandinavia significantly increased,"" he wrote for The Weekly Standard.

Kurtz has debated this issue in public essays for years with an advocate for gay marriage, M.V. Lee Badgett, research director of the Williams Institute for Sexual Orientation Law and Public Policy at UCLA.

She has criticized Kurtz’s analyses of marriage in Scandinavian countries, writing that marriage rates, divorce rates, and non-marital birth rates were already changing since the 1970s, in all post-industrial countries, regardless of whether they adopted same-sex partnership laws. In an interview, she said analyses like his don’t account for the number of people who are getting domestic partnerships and otherwise would not have gotten married.

The New York Times documented the popularity of civil solidarity pacts in France, pointing out that 95 percent of the pacts were between heterosexual couples in 2009. (These pacts more closely mirror the legislation Sobel proposed.) The Times reported that there were two civil unions for every three marriages in France,

Brad Wilcox, director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia, pointed us to the World Family Map 2013, which shows cohabitation is more common, and marriage in less common, in countries that have civil unions.

""Judging by the European experience, passage of civil unions laws appears to be linked to higher rates of cohabitation and lower rates of marriage,"" Wilcox said. ""But it's possible that a weakening faith in marriage is driving all this, not any particular legislation.""

 What about the U.S.?

We could not find evidence of the trend Sheedy spoke about happening in the United States.

We looked for apples-to-apples comparisons with the 10 states and D.C. that have passed civil unions or domestic partnership registries. In those states -- Oregon, California, Nevada, New Jersey, Illinois, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Maine, D.C., Wisconsin -- the marriage rate has fallen, but that is consistent with the national trend. It’s also not different from other declining state-by-state marriage rates from the CDC since 1990. Florida’s own rate is down from 10.9 (marriages per 1,000 people) to 7.4.

Experts we consulted agreed on this point: There is no proven causative effect of the growth of domestic partnerships and declines in marriage.

""No one has done research to look at trends at what happens with domestic partnerships,"" Badgett said.

In an email interview, Coontz said the seeming correlation with the decline of marriage in most cases is due to more heterosexual couples avoiding or delaying marriage as attitudes about marriage alternatives become more accepting.

""As that happens, countries tend to get more accepting of cohabitation and of recognizing same-sex partnerships,"" Coontz said. ""But the one does not cause the other. They both reflect longer-terms trends in gender relations, social tolerance and the institution of marriage.""

Our ruling

In opposing a bill that would allow for domestic partnerships statewide, Sheedy of the Florida Conference of Catholic Bishops said, ""In other jurisdictions where this has been enacted, we have seen that fewer people enter into marriage.""

For domestic partnerships, he has offered no support in the United States, and no experts we consulted could find reports that vouch for that effect. In some countries, domestic partnership registries and gay marriage have increased while heterosexual marriage has decreased. But it’s not at all clear that the first trend is causing the second. In other words, correlation does not equal causation.

Marriage is declining in popularity across the world, and has been for decades. No one has shown rates are declining directly because of domestic partnerships",Mostly False,"February 22, 2013"
"""Religious groups like Knights of Columbus have been forced to allow same-sex marriage ceremonies in their facilities, against their beliefs.""","
As the Rhode Island House of Representatives moved toward a vote on legalizing same-sex marriage, an ad appeared in some local newspapers asserting that those who oppose same-sex marriage had been penalized in other states.

The ad, headlined  ""The Big Lie,"" was purchased by the National Organization for Marriage-Rhode Island, which opposes same-sex marriage.

It made several claims, including this one: ""Religious groups like Knights of Columbus have been forced to allow same-sex marriage ceremonies in their facilities, against their beliefs."" The ad included the names and phone numbers of local legislators and urged readers to ask them to oppose same-sex marriage legislation.

We wondered what was behind NOM’s statement, because one of the key issues in Rhode Island’s debate over same-sex marriage is whether those who oppose it on religious grounds could face legal liability if it becomes law.

We contacted the marriage group, whose regional coordinator, Christopher Plante, e-mailed us various incidents summarized in its blog and links to others.

Only one involved the Knights of Columbus. And that was in Canada.

Here’s what we found: In 2003, two Canadian women booked a Knights of Columbus Hall owned by the Archdiocese of Vancouver for their wedding reception. (Same-sex marriage has been legal in British Columbia since July 2003 and overall in Canada since July 2005.)

After learning about the nature of the event, the Knights told the women they could not use the hall. They found another location but filed a complaint with the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal.

We read the tribunal’s somewhat contradictory split decision, issued in 2005. On the one hand, it said it ""accepts that the Knights are entitled to this constitutional protection and therefore cannot be compelled to act in a manner that is contrary to their core religious beliefs.""

But it also declared that the Knights’ conduct was discriminatory and ordered the group to pay $1,000 to each of the women ""for injury to their dignity, feelings and self-respect"" and ""to refrain from committing the same or similar contravention"" of anti-discrimination rules.

But contrary to NOM’s advertisement, it did not force the Knights ""to allow same-sex marriage ceremonies in their facilities.""

NOM cited another instance in which the owner of an Annapolis, Md., trolley tour service, based on his religious beliefs, purportedly decided in 2012 to get out of the wedding tour business so he would not have to take on same-sex couples as clients. (Same-sex marriage became legal in Maryland in March 2012 and was affirmed by voters in November.)

NOM cited a Patch Annapolis article as its source. But the example has little relevance to NOM’s claim. The tour bus company is not a religious organization and it was not forced to do anything.

In a subsequent interview, Plante referred to another case involving Methodists in the New Jersey community of Ocean Grove.

Here’s what we found: In 2007, Harriet Bernstein, 70, a retired school administrator, and Luisa Paster, 64, a retired academic librarian, decided to have a civil-union ceremony. (Like Rhode Island, New Jersey allows civil unions but not same-sex marriages.)

The couple wanted their ceremony at a waterfront pavilion that was advertised for marriage and other public events and was owned by the Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association, which describes itself as  ""God’s Square Mile at the Jersey Shore.""  

The Methodist group refused to allow the couple to use the facility.

Bernstein and Paster instead held their ceremony in June 2007 at a nearby fishing pier.

The couple complained to the New Jersey Division on Civil Rights, which decided in October 2012 that, because the association received a tax exemption from the state’s Green Acres program, the pavilion had to be open to anyone in the future.

Again, the example NOM cited didn’t support its claim because the Methodist group hadn’t been forced to hold a same-sex ceremony. (It’s conceivable, of course,  that a same-sex couple might press the issue in the future.)

We searched the Internet for any examples in which a religious group had been forced to host a same-sex ceremony against its beliefs. We couldn’t find any.

Our ruling

The National Organization for Marriage-Rhode Island said in a newspaper advertisement that ""religious groups like Knights of Columbus have been forced to allow same-sex marriage ceremonies in their facilities, against their beliefs.""

But the Knights of Columbus incident cited as proof by Plante, NOM’s regional coordinator, was from Canada and did not support its claim.

Neither did the second example it cited. Nor the third.

NOM made a strongly worded claim on the eve of a key vote that was meant to influence voters -- and their legislators.

We can’t predict what could happen under same-sex marriage laws in the future.

But we can rule on claims that are so far from the truth",False Pants on Fire,"January 27, 2013"
"""The governor does not have any power to veto a referendum [on same-sex marriage] that would be a constitutional amendment.""","
As the debate over same-sex marriage heats up again in Rhode Island, there is talk of allowing voters, rather than the legislature, to decide the issue.

Gov. Lincoln Chafee has said he would veto such a proposal if it were passed by the General Assembly. He has called on the legislature to approve same-sex marriage, which would make it legal in Rhode Island, as it is in the other five New England states.

[The House Judiciary Committee passed it Tuesday; the full House of Representatives is expected to pass it this week. It faces a less certain fate in the Senate.]

During a Jan. 13 interview on WLNE-TV, former Providence Mayor Vincent A. ""Buddy"" Cianci Jr. raised the referendum question with Christopher Plante, executive director of the National Organization for Marriage-Rhode Island, which opposes same-sex marriage.

Cianci asked Plante what he thought of Chafee's promise to veto a referendum.

Plante said Chafee couldn't do that. ""The governor does not have any power to veto a referendum that would be a constitutional amendment,"" he said.

This is a case in which context is especially important. First, let's just consider Plante's statement without its context.

If a referendum on same-sex marriage were drafted as a constitutional amendment, Plante would be correct. Although Chapter IX, Section 14 gives the governor the ability to veto any legislation passed by the General Assembly, it specifically excludes proposed constitutional amendments, which must always go before the voters. (The governor also gets no veto over General Assembly votes that involve in-house matters such as the decision to adjourn.)

Now let's consider the context.

Cianci didn't ask the question in the framework of a constitutional amendment. While all proposed constitutional amendments must be placed on the ballot, all ballot questions aren't constitutional amendments.

Sen. Frank A. Ciccone, a Providence Democrat who opposes same-sex marriage, has said he would propose an amendment, but that's unlikely to pass both chambers.

The legislation now before the House simply proposes changing the law, not the state Constitution.

If the legislature instead voted to put it on the ballot, its decision would be subject to a gubernatorial veto.

Plante, in e-mails, acknowledged that Chafee would have veto power if same-sex marriage was put to the voters as a non-constitutional question.

But he said he always answers the question the way he did because he believes same-sex marriage SHOULD be a constitutional question, a point he subsequently raised in the interview with Cianci.

""That's what we would be looking for because, if anything's going to happen with marriage, it should happen by the people,"" he said. ""We voted on whether we should change the name of the state. We voted on casinos. How much more important is the institution of marriage?""

Our ruling

Christopher Plante said Gov. Lincoln Chafee ""does not have any power to veto a referendum that would be a constitutional amendment"" on the issue of same-sex marriage.

It's true, as Plante said, that the governor has no veto power over constitutional amendments proposed by the General Assembly.

"""The city of Atlanta has one of the highest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender populations per capita, ranking third among major American cities.""","
The ongoing national debate about same-sex marriage recently reached the court of opinion inside Atlanta City Hall.

Alex Wan, an openly gay Atlanta city councilman serving his first term, introduced legislation during the City Council’s last meeting of 2012 declaring support for marriage equality.

Wan’s nonbinding resolution contained several pieces of information to back up his argument. We thought one statement in particular would be interesting to fact-check.

""The city of Atlanta has one of the highest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender populations per capita, ranking third among major American cities,"" it read.

Atlanta has long been perceived to have one of the largest LGBT populations in the South, if not the nation. An annual LGBT pride festival draws an estimated 200,000 people. Several intown neighborhoods have businesses that market heavily to the LGBT community. Mayoral candidates actively courted LGBT voters during the 2009 campaign. Wan’s resolution passed by an 11-2 vote.

Wan’s resolution may have little sway across the street from City Hall among lawmakers who work in the state Capitol. In 2004, 76 percent of Georgia voters backed a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. The councilman recognized that obstacle, but believes the tide is shifting nationally on the issue and wanted Atlanta to be on the forefront. Wan said he’s unaware of any other Georgia cities that have passed a similar resolution.

""We should be one of the first voices to that dialogue because of the sheer number (of LGBT residents in the city),"" Wan said in a telephone interview.

Wan added that he has been with his partner for more than seven years and said it ""seemed inconsistent to me"" that they’ve made such a commitment but can’t have it legally recognized by the state.

The issue is somewhat thorny inside City Hall. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed has been criticized by some LGBT activists for not fully supporting same-sex marriage. Reed, who as a state lawmaker successfully passed a hate crimes bill to protect gays and other groups, has said he respects the council’s vote on the resolution. Wan said he didn’t intend to pressure Reed by introducing the resolution and hopes the mayor will soon ""reach the same conclusion"" on same-sex marriage.

Wan said he based the claim about Atlanta off information from the online library Wikipedia. The Wikipedia link used a chart that was published in 2006 in The Seattle Times. The chart read Atlanta ranked third, with 12.8 percent of its population as LGBT. The sources for the chart were the U.S. Census Bureau and the Williams Institute, which conducts research on sexual orientation, gender identity law and public policy.

The U.S. Census Bureau tracked the number of same-sex couples (it does not attempt to determine sexual orientation) by county in 2010. Among counties with 50 or more same-sex couples, DeKalb County was first in Georgia and 10th nationwide with about 15 same-sex couples per 1,000. Fulton County was second in Georgia and ranked 21st in the U.S. with nearly 12 same-sex couples per 1,000.

According to another website, City-Data, Atlanta ranked 32nd in the percentage of same-sex unmarried households. If you narrow it down to cities with overall populations greater than 100,000, Atlanta ranked sixth in the percentage of same-sex unmarried households. The list does not indicate when it was compiled, but the numbers were pretty similar to the most recent U.S. census data.

PolitiFact Georgia reviewed 2011 U.S. census data, and it showed the percentage of same-sex unmarried households in Atlanta was 1.6 percent. Atlanta’s percentage was lower than San Francisco, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Oakland, Calif., Seattle and Santa Fe, N.M. Of those cities, Seattle is the only one in a state that recognizes same-sex marriages, and their law was passed last month.

To sum up, Councilman Wan said Atlanta has one of the highest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender populations per capita and ranks third nationally. From what we can determine from U.S. census and other data, it’s valid to state Atlanta has one of the highest LGBT populations in the country.

It’s less clear that Atlanta ranks third nationally because there’s not much current data detailing the percentage of all LGBT residents by city. Atlanta ranks below more than at least five cities when it comes to same-sex, unmarried households.

The first part of Wan’s claim appears accurate. But even these numbers are open to interpretation. It appears Atlanta is a little lower than third in the other part of the claim.

Overall, Wan’s statement is probably accurate, but it needs a lot of context",Half True,"December 7, 2012"
"Says legislation supported by gay rights activists would strip ""mother"" and ""father"" from future Texas birth certificates.","
The leader of a conservative group launched this year warns that legislation supported by gay rights advocates would amend every future birth certificate.

In a Nov. 19, 2012, interview with Austin’s KTBC-TV, Channel 7, Jonathan Saenz, president of Texas Values, which says it seeks to preserve and advance a culture of family values, said he doesn’t expect the measure to pass into law.  But ""if this change is made in the law,"" Saenz said, ""it affects everyone’s birth certificates. That means the birth certificates the way they are now, the forms, would not say ‘mother’ and ‘father.’""

Mom and Dad absent from birth certificates? 
Asked the basis of his claim, Saenz told us by email the proposal filed by Rep. Rafael Anchia, D-Dallas, for consideration by the 2013 Legislature strips references to a mother and father from supplemental birth certificates, which describes certificates mostly issued in adoption cases.

Saenz said in the TV interview: ""So if you wanted them, any parent wants them,"" meaning birth certificates, ""they’re not going to have ‘mother’ and ‘father’ on there. So this isn’t just about the homosexual lobby wanting their rights. It’s partly about that issue, but this change in the law would impact everyone’s birth certificates.""

Chuck Smith, executive director of Equality Texas, which says it lobbies for the elimination of discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression, said in an email and online post that partly because Anchia’s House Bill 201 only applies to birth certificates issued in adoption cases, Saenz’s claim is incorrect, a critique that Anchia echoed by telephone. Smith initially brought Saenz’s claim to our attention.

Nearly 30,000 so-called ""supplemental"" birth certificates were filed by the state from September 2011 through August 2012, according to Christine Mann, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services, which filed nearly 388,000 regular birth certificates, the kind issued after babies are born, in the period. Both types, once issued, look the same, she said by email.

Anchia’s proposal would replace a provision in the Texas Health and Safety Code saying that on a supplemental birth certificate, one parent must be a female, named as the mother, and the other a male, named as the father. The law would say instead that the ""supplementary birth certificate of an adopted child must be in the names of both adoptive parents,"" not specifying genders. The measure would take effect in September 2013. 
The way the law now works for same-sex couples is that one adoptive parent must choose to be designated as the father, in the case of a male couple, or the mother, in the case of a female couple, and the other parent is not listed on the resulting birth certificate, according to information posted online by State Health Services. By email, Mann confirmed that the 1997 Legislature put the gender-specific requirement in place of the previous law requiring only that parents be listed.

So, would mother and father fade from Texas birth certificates in general?

We noticed that the fiscal note for a similar proposal offered by Anchia in the 2011 session quotes State Health Services as saying relevant forms would be modified to show ""Parent 1"" and ""Parent 2."" In contrast, the ""Certificate of Adoption"" form now filled out to obtain a supplemental birth certificate has spaces for applicants to designate the child’s mother and father.

By phone, two lawyers with expertise in adoption cases told us they do not read Anchia’s proposal as Saenz does.

Michael Lackmeyer of Killeen said the proposal solely relates to birth certificates in adoption cases, not  the vast majority issued after babies are born. Also, he said, he believes the state could keep the existing application for supplemental certificates, perhaps amended with instructions stating the adopting mother need not be a female nor the father a male.

""I don’t really think it’s going to do quite what the opposition thinks it’s going to do,"" Lackmeyer said.

Jeff Barnett of Austin agreed, saying nothing in the proposal should lead to certificates issued after birth losing ""mother"" and ""father"" designations. All the proposal does is remove the hurdle that one adopting parent be male and the other female, Barnett said.

In contrast, Mann of State Health Services offered an uncertain analysis, saying by email that while the proposal may not appear to affect all certificates, that remains a possibility.

If the ""modification is made to only supplementary birth records, it may have the effect of identifying adopted persons,"" Mann wrote. ""If you modify just the supplementary birth records of adopted persons by including only gender-neutral references to the parents (e.g. ‘parent 1’ and ‘parent 2’) and leave all other birth records with the ‘mother’ and ‘father’ references, that gender neutral reference/record distinguishes adopted person’s records and thus identifies them, which under current state law, is prohibited. As a result,"" she said, ""we would have to have a consistent reference on all birth certificates going forward so as to not bring attention to those which are for adopted persons.""

We had asked Mann if Anchia's proposal would result in ""mother"" and ""father"" entries going away from all certificates. 
She replied: ""The answer may be no if we can find a way to add ‘or parent’ ‘or co-parent’ or some other additional category along with ‘mother’ and ‘father’ to provide the gender-neutral option provided by the (legislation) on all certificates such as ‘Mother or Parent 1’ and ‘Father or Parent 2.’ This may be an issue of space on the certificates, so it’s unclear at this point if this is an option.""

Mann also said the agency ""would need to modify more than 20 forms which currently reflect the names of the mother and father to show parent and co-parent to comply with this bill. These modifications would result in programming changes which must be made to the Texas Electronic Registrar and Remote Issuance systems, as well as the Texas.gov web portal. These changes would affect all birth certificates yet to be issued. It would not affect birth certificates already issued.""

Finally, we ran her comments by Saenz, Smith and the outside lawyers. Saenz said they uphold his claim. Smith stressed that no form changes are required by Anchia’s proposal.

Lackmeyer said by email that ""even though the changes address only supplemental"" birth certificates, ""who knows what any state agency will do to the entire system to implement that minor change?"" 
By email, Barnett said the proposal still does not mandate the removal of ""mother"" and ""father"" from certificates.

Our ruling

The leader of Texas Values says a proposed change in law would strip ""mother"" and ""father"" from Texas birth certificates.

The proposal would eliminate a requirement that adoptive couples seeking a birth certificate list a male father and female mother. But nothing in the proposal explicitly removes mother and father entries on certificates and it seems reasonable to us that any needed tweaks could be made without Moms and Dads vanishing from them. 
Then again, the state agency spokeswoman was uncertain about the proposal's effect, which sways us to say that Saenz's claim has an element of truth",Mostly False,"November 30, 2012"
"Says Tammy Baldwin introduced a bill that would require doctors and other health care workers to ask patients, ""including young children, whether they are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or if they know their gender identity.""","
State Sen. Glenn Grothman, R-West Bend, is among Wisconsin’s most blunt and outspoken lawmakers.

So, when he weighed in on the U.S. Senate race -- claiming the federal government would force doctors to ask patients about their sexual orientation -- we decided to take a look.

In a Sept. 28, 2012, news release, Grothman attacked the Democratic candidate, U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin of Madison, stating:

""In 2010, Tammy Baldwin introduced H.R. 6109, which would require healthcare workers, including doctors, to ask patients at government-funded clinics, including young children, whether they are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or if they know their gender identity.""

He pledged to sponsor state legislation to exempt Wisconsin minors from such a bill.

Baldwin and her view

In the news release, Grothman called Baldwin ""obsessed with radical left-wing social causes"" -- which dovetails with attacks made by Baldwin’s Republican opponent, former governor Tommy Thompson.

Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus said Baldwin’s bill would have given the U.S. secretary of health and human services discretion on how to collect information about sexual orientation and gender identity.

Questions would be added to surveys already being conducted and minors would not be questioned without parental consent, he said. ""These are not doctors asking their patients questions,"" he said.

So, those are the views of Grothman and Baldwin. Let’s take a closer look.

The bill

Baldwin introduced House Resolution 6109, the Health Data Collection Improvement Act, in September in 2010.

The bill got little news coverage at the time, although a reader of the Eau Claire Leader-Telegram newspaper raised it in an online discussion after the first Thompson-Baldwin Senate debate in September 2012.

Baldwin explained the reason for her bill in a statement when the bill was introduced, according to Washington Blade, a gay news publication:

""Currently, the federal government does not collect any information about the health and well-being of LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Americans. Consequently, our knowledge of the health of the LGBT community is drastically insufficient and our current health care system fails LGBT individuals on many levels.""

The bill was sent to the Health Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The subcommittee approved an amendment by Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill., prohibiting the collection of sexual orientation and gender identity from minors without the consent of a parent or guardian.

The subcommittee then voted, 12-10, to send the amended bill to the full committee, where it died.

What would it have done?

According to a summary by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, Baldwin’s measure would have required the health and human services secretary ""to ensure that each HHS health service program or HHS health survey provides, to the extent the secretary determines appropriate and practicable, for the voluntary collection of data on the sexual orientation and gender identity of individuals who apply for or receive health services through such program, or who respond to such survey.""

That’s a mouthful.

To break it down:
  

We discussed the bill with health policy experts from two Washington, D.C. research organizations: Kellan Baker of the liberal Center for American Progress, and Edmund Haislmaier of the conservative Heritage Foundation.

They agreed that since Baldwin’s bill gave discretion to the health and human services secretary, it’s possible that doctors and other health care workers in certain clinics or other settings could have been required to ask patients about their sexual orientation and gender identity -- although that could have been through routine intake questionnaires rather than being asked to face to face.

The experts also agreed that Baldwin’s bill would not have required doctors or other health care workers to ask patients about sexual orientation. Again, it would have been left to the HHS secretary to decide how to collect the data, and that might have been largely done through means such as anonymous telephone surveys that the agency already does.

Grothman himself agreed, when we asked about his claim, that while the bill was written to be applied broadly, it would have been up to HHS to write regulations on how to collect the data.

A final note:

While Baldwin’s bill did not become law, the federal government is moving to collect such data in connection with President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, known to critics as ""Obamacare.""

In June 2011, the Health and Human Services Department announced it would add questions on sexual orientation to its national data collection efforts by 2013. The department also announced it would begin a process to collect information on gender identity.

Baker, of the Center for American Progress, said HHS is working on adding sexual orientation to its National Health Interview Survey, which is done randomly by telephone.

Our rating

Grothman said Baldwin introduced a bill to require doctors and other health care workers to ask patients, ""including young children, whether they are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or if they know their gender identity.""

There’s an element of truth in Grothman’s claim, in that the bill would have required a federal agency to collect such data. But there was no requirement that doctors or other health care workers question their patients",Mostly False,"October 23, 2012"
"""Barack Hussein Obama will … force doctors to assist homosexuals in buying surrogate babies.""","
A fact-challenged newspaper ad attacking President Barack Obama addresses some standard wedge issues: same-sex marriage, illegal immigration, Islamic law.

Then there’s this claim: ""Barack Hussein Obama will move America to force doctors to assist homosexuals in buying surrogate babies.""

It’s one of those statements that’s so far outside reality, our experts wondered where to start.

William Murray, chairman of the political action committee that says it placed the ad in 19 papers in three states, said it predicted ""what we believe Obama will do in a second term.""

But even predictions require some connection to the way the world works.

This fails that test.

 ‘Outrageous,’ ‘imaginary,’ ‘fevered dream’

Volunteers for Murray’s Government Is Not God PAC put together support for the ad’s claims, which they sent to us. The evidence? That Obama supports adoption by same-sex couples and extended benefits to same-sex domestic partners of federal employees.

But that didn't come close to proving the claim. The links don’t address: a) doctors b) surrogacy c) buying babies.

Nor do they address whether Obama would be interested in such an action. And a group that lobbies for equal treatment of gays and lesbians hasn’t seen any such evidence.

""We cannot find any remotely related action or statement by the president or his administration that would lead anyone to such an outrageous conclusion,"" said Brian Moulton, legal director for the Human Rights Campaign.

Experts in surrogacy from a medical perspective had a similar reaction.

""We have no idea what this claim is based on,"" said Eleanor Nicoll, public affairs manager for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

But even if Obama were interested, he would find a nearly impossible task (short of, say, suspending the rule of law).

Whether surrogacy is legal is a matter of state law, not federal. In the District of Columbia, for example, attorneys could serve jail time for helping write a contract between prospective parents and a woman who wants to carry their child. In other states, surrogacy varies from perfectly legal to functionally impossible, according to a summary of state regulation from Maryland law firm Creative Family Connections.

Michael Tanner, an expert in health care policy at the libertarian Cato Institute, pointed out that even if the Obama administration managed to require non-discriminatory coverage for artificial reproductive technology in its health care law, doctors don’t have to accept insurance, and they don’t have to perform procedures.

""They can't supersede the surrogacy laws. They can't force physicians,"" he said. ""... That has got to be the most bizarre claim I have ever seen in my life.""

He called it ""a fevered dream.""

Jonathan Rauch, author of Gay Marriage: Why It Is Good for Gays, Good for Straights, and Good for America, and a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution told us, ""Even a sane version of this claim is imaginary.""

 Our ruling

A newspaper ad claimed that ""Barack Hussein Obama will … force doctors to assist homosexuals in buying surrogate babies."" There’s no evidence Obama is interested in such a requirement. But even if he were, surrogacy laws vary by state and there’s no mechanism to force doctors to perform a procedure.

"Says, ""Less than half of all states have legal protections on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, despite the fact that LGBT Americans report employment discrimination and unemployment at much higher rates than the U.S. average.""","
U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., issued a press release recently, in support of legislation to end employment discrimination against workers who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.  S.811, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2011, would also protect people who express their gender identity at work.  

""Less than half of all states have legal protections on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, despite the fact that LGBT Americans report employment discrimination and unemployment at much higher rates than the U.S. average,"" the release said.

PolitiFact Oregon was confused. Wasn’t such employer behavior already prohibited under federal civil rights law? Isn’t it the same as how employers aren’t allowed to hire, promote, pay or fire based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin?

Apparently not. Jamal Raad, Merkley’s spokesman, pointed us to a map by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force that shows Oregon as one of 16 states and Washington, D.C., that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or the expression of gender identification. Five additional states prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, but not on expression. So Merkley is correct about the figures.

Raad also clued us into other reports and studies to back up the statement.

The Center for American Progress has a state-by-state report that goes even further, identifying 10 additional states with policies prohibiting such behavior in state government or in a part of state government. Those are generally done by executive policy. These policies do not carry the weight of law and do not extend beyond public employees. The federal government also prohibits discrimination against gays and lesbians, as do many Fortune 500 companies.

Now the next question: Do gay, lesbian and bisexual workers report employment discrimination at much higher rates than the U.S. average? This was much harder to track down.

Raad directed us to a 2005 Gallup Poll, which showed that 15 percent of employed people reported being discriminated against in the previous 12 months. Gallup researchers concluded the actual rate was probably between 9 percent and 15 percent.

Among racial/ethnic groups, whites reported the lowest incidence of discrimination, at 12 percent and Asians reported the highest incidence, at 31 percent. But there was no breakout by sexual orientation, leaving us without an apples-to-apples comparison. (Of the types of discrimination, sexual orientation made up for 4 percent of cases, same as religion. Gender accounted for 26 percent of cases.)

We turned to Jennifer Pizer, legal director of the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law, whose researchers submitted testimony in support of legislation. Pizer said she did not know of a broader study comparing discrimination rates.

But her institute relies on several statistics, including a 2008 survey showing that a quarter of lesbian, gay and bisexual respondents reported experiencing job discrimination in the previous five years. A 2007 report of past surveys found that anywhere between 16 percent and 68 percent of LGBT reported experiencing employment discrimination. Again, that’s a fairly broad range and it doesn’t indicate an average of all employees.

Perhaps most helpful to us was, Pizer’s colleagues also aggregated state data and found that lesbian, gay and bisexual workers filed anti-discrimination complaints at about the same rate as women, about 5 complaints per every 10,000 employees. Complaints based on race and ethnicity were higher, at 7 per 10,000 workers.

Just out of curiosity, we checked with Oregon Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian’s office. Spokesman Bob Estabrook said discrimination based on sexual orientation makes up about 2 percent of job and housing complaints. California’s fair employment and housing department shows a similar percentage. But this doesn’t tell us much about rates of job discrimination in general.

Where does this leave us?

We couldn’t find definitive data showing that gay, lesbian and transgender workers ""report employment discrimination and unemployment at much higher rates than the U.S. average."" We suspect attitudes toward all minority groups are changing and also, as the workplace becomes more diversified, we expect the U.S. discrimination average to change. We don’t know whether the LGBT community faces more discrimination at work than ethnic groups, women, older people or the disabled.

That aside, the studies cited -- and quite frankly, common sense -- suggest that the gay and lesbian population sees its share of discrimination at the workplace. And transgender workers, most likely, see more than their fair share of unemployment and discrimination. And they are not protected under the federal Civil Rights Act.

Merkley is correct to say that in more than half the states in the country, there is no law against employers who discriminate based on sexual orientation although employers and government agencies may have their own prohibitions.

The statement requires clarification on the scope of protections offered in private and public sector employment. It also requires clarification about what we do know and do not know about job discrimination faced by the general population and other groups",Mostly True,"June 18, 2012"
"Homosexual behavior ""cuts your life by about 20 years.""","Del. Bob Marshall’s statements about homosexuals have generated plenty of controversy this spring.

Marshall, one of four candidates running in Tuesday’s GOP primary for the U.S. Senate, made national news May 15 when he led a successful movement in the House of Delegates to reject the judicial nomination of a gay prosecutor. Among other things, Marshall argued that Tracy Thorne-Begland could not be trusted on the bench to uphold Virginia’s ban on same-sex marriage.

Two days later, during an interview on CNN, Marshall again questioned Thorne-Begland’s ability to render fair judgments, saying, ""Sodomy is not a civil right.""

And during a campaign swing in Charlottesville on May 24, a reporter asked Marshall whether gay sex should be protected by the constitution.

""The court says it is in certain limited circumstances, but you know what that behavior does? It cuts your life by about 20 years,"" Marshall said.

Is Marshall right that the lifespan of gays is, on average, two decades shorter than heterosexuals? We asked him to provide proof.    

Marshall, who represents Prince William County, sent us an email citing a study published in June 1997 in the International Journal of Epidemiology. The report, conducted by researchers at the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, examined how HIV affected the mortality of gay and bisexual men in Vancouver from 1987 to 1992.

The study found that life expectancy at age 20 among gay and bisexual men in Vancouver was 8 to 21 years shorter than that of all men in the Canadian city. The researchers also said their conclusion probably underestimated the life expectancy deficit among gay and bisexual men because AIDS cases were underreported.

But that’s not the end of the story.

The report’s authors, in 2001, took exception to conservatives who used their study to condemn the lifestyle of gay and bisexual men. The researchers said circumstances had changed since their study ended in the early 1990s.

""If we were to repeat this analysis today the life expectancy of gay and bisexual men would be greatly improved,"" the authors wrote. ""Deaths from HIV infection have declined dramatically in this population since 1996.""

The researchers, however, did not conduct a new study on the life expectancy for gay and bisexual men.

We spoke to Julio Montaner, a co-author of the study and director of the British Columbia Center for Excellence in HIV/AIDs. He said Marshall’s statement is a ""gross misrepresentation"" of the research.

""To use my report to support the notion that gay and bisexual sex is somehow the reason why people die early is misusing the data,"" Montaner said.

Montaner noted that his group’s original report was conducted at a time when the HIV epidemic was poorly controlled and treatments were ineffective. Since then, there have have been great strides in treating the disease and preventing its spread, Montaner said. In British Columbia, annual diagnoses of new infections have dropped from 900 in the mid-1990s to 300 in recent years, he said. Deaths from HIV also have fallen sharply, he said.

In the United States, figures from the Centers for Disease Control show that the rate of HIV deaths per 100,000 people peaked at 36.3 deaths in 1995 and fell to 2.7 in 2010, the latest year data is available.

Gay and bisexual men remain the group most heavily affected by HIV, according to the CDC. Although they represent 2 percent of the U.S. population, gay and bisexual men accounted for 61 percent of new HIV infections in 2009.

Marshall, in his email, listed sent abstracts of other studies saying homosexuals have high rates of suicide attempts and certain types of cancer. Two of the studies cite high number of deaths among gay men from HIV and AIDS in the 1980s and 1990s.

""With significant investment in medical resources, homosexuals are living longer than in previous years with their compromised health status, but nevertheless still shorter lives than comparable married heterosexuals who don’t eat up medical resources to the same extent,"" Marshall wrote.

None of the other research Marshall listed proves his point that homosexual behavior today cuts life expectancy by 20 years.

Marshall, for example, cited a study by the American Journal of Public Health that examined the mortality of men and women in same-sex marriages in Denmark from 1989 to 2004. It found that death rates among those couples was a third higher than the general population, despite a significant drop among men in same-sex couples. Even so, the report, published in 2009, criticized other published claims that homosexuals have a life expectancy that’s more than 20 years shorter than heterosexuals.

""Although further research is needed, the claims of drastically increased overall mortality in gay men and lesbians appear unjustified,"" the report said.

We sought U.S. data on how how life expectancy of homosexuals compared to the rest of the population. But the CDC, which compiles statistics on longevity, doesn’t keep figures based on sexual orientation.

Laura Durso -- a public policy fellow at the Williams Institute at UCLA, which researches issues facing lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered (LGBT) people -- said few national population-based surveys in the U.S. inquire ask about sexual orientation. That makes it difficult to compare the life expectancies of homosexuals to heterosexuals, she said.

Still, Durso said, reports have shown that LGBT populations face increased certain health risks. LGBT youths in particular have been shown to have a higher rate of suicide, she said. Gay men appear to be at higher risk for anal cancer while lesbians appear to be at higher risk of breast cancer, she said.

Our Ruling

Bob Marshall said homosexual behavior cuts a person’s life by about 20 years.

The research Marshall cites to support his claim is two decades old and was conducted near the height of the HIV epidemic. One of the authors said there have been tremendous advances in HIV treatment over the last 20 years and that Marshall’s statement is a ""gross misrepresentation"" of the research.

The U.S. death rate from HIV was nine times higher in 1990 than it was in 2010, the latest year for the data.

Marshall cites a number of other studies that show homosexuals face certain health risks. But none of them focused on the life expectancy of homosexuals, and they certainly didn't conclude that gays die about 20 years earlier than heterosexuals",False,"June 7, 2012"
Says Mitt Romney would deny gay people the right to adopt children.,"
Within a day of President Barack Obama announcing his support for same-sex marriage, his campaign released an ad chiding Republican rival Mitt Romney for opposing it.

It’s true that Romney does not support gay marriage -- he reaffirmed that position the same day as Obama’s historic announcement. But the Obama campaign video claims that Romney would deny certain rights to gay partners, including the right to adopt children.

The ad shows short clips of both candidates talking about gay marriage -- Obama saying he supports it, Romney saying he doesn’t -- then the words ""What rights would Romney deny?"" appear onscreen.

""Health insurance for your partner and kids,"" it says on the screen, followed by ""adopting children together,"" and finally ""emergency medical decisions for partners."" The words are all stamped with ""DENIED"" in red letters.

We wondered about the adoption claim: Does Romney’s opposition to gay marriage go that far?

Obama campaign’s evidence

Asked for evidence to back up the ad, the Obama campaign pointed to Romney’s support for a federal constitutional amendment that would define marriage as a relationship between one man and one woman. That bill, as proposed, would override any state laws, such as the one in Massachusetts, making marriage between people of the same gender legal. The amendment does not address adoption by gay couples. The day of Obama’s announcement, May 9, 2012, Romney said he also opposes civil unions ""if they are identical to marriage other than by name.""

But we found Romney has repeatedly expressed support for domestic partnership rights, on a state-by-state basis. The Obama campaign cited this ""states’ rights"" stance -- in which states would be empowered to allow or deny certain domestic partner benefits -- as evidence that Romney would deny the rights. But we find a flaw in that logic, because when Romney has argued that position, he has listed those rights in positive terms.

""My preference again would be to have a national standard, with one standard for the nation. Now that doesn’t mean that same-sex couples can’t enter into domestic partnerships, and the benefits associated with domestic partnerships could be, developed from, by enterprise, by the state, by the federal government,"" he told the Ames (Iowa) Tribune editorial board in 2011. ""So one could say for instance that in Iowa, a same-sex couple can come together, can adopt a child. And they can have hospital visitation rights and so forth. I mean you could decide what benefits, each state can decide the benefits associated with people who live in domestic partnerships.""

In other words, Romney didn’t frame the issue in terms of rights the states could deny gay couples. He listed adoption and hospital visitation as rights that states could grant.

More from Romney on the topic

Other statements from Romney do not offer resounding support for the rights of gay couples to adopt. His words are measured, and often accompany a statement about his opposition to gay marriage. But they make clear that, at least, Romney does not favor state laws prohibiting gay couples from adopting.

2006: In saying he planned to pursue a law in Massachusetts exempting religious groups from allowing adoption by gay parents, Romney was quoted in the Boston Globe, ""I know that there will be some gay couples who will say that this could be discriminatory against us, except that there are many, many other agencies that can meet the needs of those gay couples, and I recognize that they have a legitimate interest in being able to receive adoptive services.""

June 2007: ""There are other ways to raise kids that's fine: single moms, grandparents raising kids, gay couples raising kids. That's the American way, to have people have their freedom of choice,"" he said, according to the Associated Press.

July 2008: Wolf Blitzer, then on CNN, asked, ""If the states -- whatever state said, you know what, it's fine for gay couples to adopt kids, that would be OK with you?"" Romney answered, ""I didn't oppose that here in Massachusetts. My view was the best setting for a child to be raised is where there's a mom and a dad, but I did not say let's put in place a law that would prevent a court from deciding that a child, instead of being in an orphanage, should be with a same-sex couple or with a single mom or a single dad. You leave that up to the court and let them make the decision.""

Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul told BuzzFeed in February 2012: ""Gov. Romney believes a family with one mother and one father is the ideal setting to raise a child. That doesn't mean adoption by other parents — whether they be single or same-sex — should be outlawed. States have to make decisions that are in the best interests of children, and where possible that should be in a home with one mother and one father.""

And the day after Obama’s announcement, Romney told Fox News host Neil Cavuto: ""I also know many gay couples are able to adopt children. That’s fine.""

He also said, ""If two people of the same gender want to live together, want to have a loving relationship, and even want to adopt a child -- in my state, individuals of the same sex were able to adopt children. In my view, that's something which people have the right to do. But to call that marriage, is, in my view, a departure from the real meaning of that word.""

Our ruling

Obama and Romney have starkly different positions on gay marriage, but Obama’s ad distorts Romney's position when it says he would deny gay couples the right to adopt children.

We found nothing in Romney’s past statements to support that claim. He is a clear opponent of gay marriage, and does not seem to favor civil unions if they afford all the same benefits as marriage. But he is on record as supporting domestic partnerships, with specific rights determined individually by states. The Obama campaign interprets this as Romney saying states would be allowed to deny gay couples the right to adopt. But when he has articulated his position, he has often mentioned adoption as one of the rights states could grant. And this year, Romney called adoption by same-sex couples ""something which people have the right to do.""

"Says the Obama administration ""will no longer enforce the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).""","
The Human Rights Campaign, a national organization that fights for the rights of gays and lesbians, has targeted U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., for his statements on the Defense of Marriage Act.

In a mailer, Buchanan said that ""the Obama administration recently announced it will no longer enforce the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), the federal law defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman.""

The Human Rights Campaign said that was wrong.

""While President Obama announced last year that his administration believed the law to be unconstitutional and could not continue to defend it in court, he also made clear that the law would continue to be enforced unless struck down or repealed,"" said the HRC.

The act, signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1996, says states do not have to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states, and that the federal government does not recognize same-sex marriage. Obama promised to repeal DOMA during his 2008 campaign.

The HRC sent a press release on March 14, 2012, claiming that a Buchanan mailer mischaracterized the status of DOMA. The HRC said they received the mailer recently, but staff at Buchanan’s office told us the mailer was a year old. They also said Buchanan, who represents the Sarasota area, stood by the statements.

Was Buchanan correct to state that the Obama administration recently announced it would no longer enforce DOMA, or was he wrong, as the HRC suggested?

DOMA status

In February 2011, Attorney General Eric Holder sent a letter to House Speaker John Boehner saying that the Obama administration would no longer defend the law -- in court.

Holder argued that the law, as applied to same-sex couples legally married under state law, violates the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment. While the letter stated that the Obama administration would not defend the law in two cases, it also stated that it will continue to be ""enforced"" by the executive branch until Congress repeals it, or the courts definitively strike it down.

The law will still be defended, though. A group of House leaders directed the House general counsel to defend DOMA -- the initial contract with a law firm was for $500,000 and later amended for up to $1.5 million.

In response to our questions, the U.S. Department of Justice sent us a letter Holder wrote to Boehner in February 2012 related to a case in which military personnel were seeking benefits for same-sex spouses. Holder wrote that though DOMA is unconstitutional, the executive branch will continue to enforce a federal law that pertains to the military that defines spouses as opposite sex.

According to the Service Members Legal Defense Network, which is working on the plaintiffs’ side, although DOJ is not defending the suit, the plaintiffs and other gay and lesbian military families are not getting the same benefits as their straight married peers.

In October 2011 the department announced some benefits where members may designate beneficiaries of their choosing, regardless of sexual orientation. But Department of Defense spokeswoman Eileen Lainez said that the eligibility for a number of benefits is restricted by several statutes including DOMA.

Obama has repeatedly said that his administration would no longer defend DOMA in the courts, but he distinguished between defending in the courts and enforcement during a Sept. 28, 2011, roundtable discussion with reporters.

""Administratively, we can't ignore the law. DOMA is still on the books,"" Obama said. ""What we have said is even as we enforce it, we don't support it, we think it's unconstitutional. The position that my administration has taken I think will have a significant influence on the court as it examines the constitutionality of this law.""

HRC gave us two examples of how DOMA remains enforced. The Internal Revenue Service will not allow legally married same-sex couples to file jointly, and the Social Security Administration will not provide survivors benefits to a surviving same-sex spouse. We confirmed this with the two agencies.

On the other hand, Buchanan spokesman Max Goodman cited examples of where the administration’s announcement -- or Holder’s direct action -- influenced courts to halt deportation of illegal immigrants, which he counted as a lack of enforcement.

• In March 2011, the deportation case of Monica Alcota was put on hold. Alcota overstayed her tourist visa from Argentina and married a woman in Connecticut. The couple’s attorney said the judge and government attorneys agreed to the action for several reasons, including Obama’s direction to not defend DOMA. A judge later dismissed her case.

• In May 2011, Holder vacated a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals in the case of Paul Wilson Dorman, a gay man from Ireland cleared for deportation after the judges ruled against the man on the basis of DOMA. Holder asked the board to determine whether the man, who had a civil union in New Jersey, could be considered a spouse under New Jersey law. The case remains pending.

•  An immigration judge in Newark suspended a deportation in the case of Henry Velandia in May 2011 citing the action that Holder took in the Dorman case. Velandia, from Venezuela, had married a man in Connecticut. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement later decided that it would no longer pursue deportation.

Buchanan’s office also pointed to comments made by constitutional scholars such as Ed Whelan, who worked for the U.S. Department of Justice from 2001 to 2004. Whelan testified about DOMA before the House in 2011 and is now the president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank.

""The executive branch’s defense of a law in court is an essential part of enforcement, not something separate from enforcement,"" Whelan told PolitiFact in an email.

""Might it have been better if Rep. Buchanan’s statement had said: ‘The Obama administration recently announced that it would no longer enforce in court the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), the federal law defining marriage as between a man and a woman’? Perhaps. But as this tweak illustrates, there is no problem with his use of the word ‘enforce’ (rather than ‘defend’).""

We decided to run the statement by a few other legal experts not involved in the cases

Even though the president takes an oath to support the Constitution, the president can take a position on whether a particular statute is unconstitutional, said Stephen Schnably, a constitutional law professor at University of Miami. If he finds that it is unconstitutional, there’s an argument that the president’s duty bars him from defending it in court.

DOMA raises the unanswered question of whether Obama and his administration have the legal right to choose which of Congress’ laws they defend and which ones they don’t -- a question before the U.S. Supreme Court in a separate case, said Bob Jarvis, a constitutional law professor at Nova Southeastern University.

""One could certainly say that any failure to compel obedience to DOMA is a failure to enforce it,"" Jarvis said via email. ""On the other hand, one could also say that a failure to defend a law in court is different from a failure to enforce it in everyday life.""

Peter Edelman, a constitutional law professor at Georgetown, said there’s a difference between deciding not to defend the constitutionality of a law and failing to enforce it.

""It is a significant step in and of itself, but it is not the same as not enforcing the law,"" he said.

Our ruling

Buchanan said in a mailer that the Obama administration  ""would no longer enforce the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA)."" The Obama administration said in February 2011 it would no longer defend the law in the courts. But the HRC cites examples that enforcement continues -- for example, gay couples can’t file their taxes jointly. We found legal experts who made arguments on both sides about whether not defending DOMA in the courts equals not enforcing it.

If Buchanan had said that Obama would no longer ""defend"" DOMA he’d be on safe ground, but he chose ""enforce"" instead. The Obama administration is enforcing the law to some extent, such as forbidding joint tax returns or survivors’ benefits in Social Security for gay couples. Still, there’s clear evidence that the Obama administration is seeking to mitigate the law’s effects",Half True,"April 9, 2012"
Says he and President Barack Obama have the same position on gay marriage.,"When it comes to marriage equality, Gov. Chris Christie’s position is clear: he supports civil unions and ensuring that same-sex couples have the same legal protections as married couples.

In this regard, Christie said during a Feb. 23 appearance on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" program that he and President Barack Obama are like-minded.

Christie, a Republican, and Obama, a Democrat, agreeing on an issue that has divided people across the nation?

Not exactly, PolitiFact New Jersey found. The governor and the president agree on some issues related to same-sex marriage – but not all.

Let’s review what both leaders have said about gay marriage.

Christie opposes same-sex marriage and on Feb. 17 conditionally vetoed a Legislature bill legalizing it.

In 2008, prior to the presidential election, Obama said marriage is a union between one man and one woman. Since then, he has said is viewpoint is ""evolving,"" according to numerous published reports.

In vetoing the Legislature’s bill, Christie suggested a referendum this November on gay marriage. Obama has opposed referenda on same-sex marriage, most recently legislation in North Carolina that would define marriage as between one man and one woman.

So what do the governor and president have in common? Both have said they support strengthening states’ civil union laws. But unlike Christie, Obama has not answered directly whether he supports same-sex marriage.

White House spokesman Brandon Lepow referred us to past remarks made by White House Press Secretary Jay Carney when we sought comment on Christie’s statement.

""The President has long opposed … divisive and discriminatory efforts to deny rights and benefits to same-sex couples,""  Carney said in January.

Christie has the same view, according to an e-mail from his spokesman Michael Drewniak.

""The Governor has proposed a strengthening of civil unions to ensure that those rights are appropriately enforced and administered under the law.  The Governor has never spoken to the legislature’s qualifications to decide the issue one way or the other; he said what he would do with legislation if it was passed and did so (conditional veto), because it was against his beliefs.  He said an issue of such magnitude and importance deserved to be put in the hands of the people, as a pathway for those who support same sex marriage to achieve it – if it was supported by a majority of voters. None of this is news, it’s been said multiple times by the Governor.""

But given their differing view on same-sex marriage referenda, Christie might have taken too far his claim of a similar view as Obama when program host Joe Scarborough asked, ""Is there any space on your position on gay marriage and President Barack Obama's?"" ""Not that I'm aware of,"" Christie responded. Others disagree with the governor.

""President Obama has taken a strong position opposing state efforts to put the rights of minorities up for a popular vote -- including most recently in North Carolina -- and the President is committed to eliminating all forms of discrimination against LGBT Americans under federal law, like the so-called 'Defense of Marriage' Act,"" University of Pennsylvania law professor Tobias Barrington Wolff said in an e-mail. Wolff also was an adviser to Obama's 2008 campaign on issues affecting the gay community.

Ned Flaherty, a Boston-based project manager for Marriage Equality USA, criticized Christie for going against the Legislature's vote, vetoing the bill and suggesting a referendum be held.

""He’s turning to people in the business of having a pulse on the public and saying, ‘I don’t believe you,’"" Flaherty said.

Our ruling

During a recent television interview Christie said he and Obama shared the same views on gay marriage. That’s true to a point – both leaders say they support civil unions and oppose discriminating against same-sex couples. But that’s where the similarities end. Christie supports a public vote in New Jersey on allowing same-sex marriage; Obama opposes such referenda. Christie opposes same-sex marriage. The president won’t answer the question directly",Half True,"March 25, 2012"
"AIDS was transmitted to humans because ""one guy"" had sex with ""a monkey"" and then started ""having sex with men.""","Of the many controversial claims state Sen. Stacey Campfield, R-Knoxville, made in an interview on satellite radio last week with a gay-rights advocate, none was more sensational than his assertion that AIDS in humans came from ""one guy screwing a monkey, if I recall correctly, and then having sex with men.""

This came about 12 minutes into an interview that ostensibly was about a bill Campfield has championed declaring that only sexuality involving ""natural human reproduction"" can be addressed in the state’s K-8 public-school classrooms. Campfield calls it a ""Don’t Teach Gay"" bill, but it’s been more commonly called the ""Don’t Say Gay"" bill. Critics say it could open the door to allowing anti-gay bullying and harassment and potentially prevent teachers and administrators from helping students properly deal with sexuality issues.

We’re working on a separate article to post on Sunday that will cover many of the other claims made by Campfield, who also serves as Tennessee campaign co-director for Newt Gingrich's presidential campaign. This item will explore Campfield's specific claim about AIDS entering the human population because ""one guy"" had sex with a monkey and then had sex with men.

Here's the pertinent exchange for this fact check:

CAMPFIELD: Most people realize that AIDS came from the homosexual community.

SIGNORILE: No, it did not. Do you know the history of AIDS?

CAMPFIELD: It was one guy screwing a monkey, if I recall correctly, and then having sex with men.

SIGNORILE: No, it was not one guy screwing a monkey. It was somebody in Africa. Do you know the history of AIDS? Because I can tell you in a minute? It was somebody in Africa who actually killed a monkey, because they eat the meat of many animals, as I’m sure you do, I’m sure you eat the meat of animals. And they ate the meat of a monkey and the blood, they chopped it up, and it got in a cut and that’s how AIDS then spread among heterosexuals all through Africa, and it is a pandemic around the world.

In the days since the interview, Campfield has done other interviews and put up posts on his blog, adding some caveats and qualifiers to some of his claims.

But in his blog posts, one of which he titled ""More fun than a barrel of monkeys,"" Campfield stuck by his claim of cross-species simian-human sex as the origin of AIDS. He wrote: ""The research on sex with a monkey being the first transmitter of AIDS has not been proven nor firmly dis proven (sic). It is one of about 5 theories I was able to find on the source of AIDS.""

We figured that because the legendary ""Scopes Monkey Trial"" happened in our fair state -- about 80 miles southwest of Knoxville -- PolitiFact Tennessee should examine this theory of evolution.

Consequence of hunting

Signorile had recently interviewed infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist Dr. Jacques Pepin, author of the recently published book, The Origin of AIDS, and Signorile accurately characterized Pepin’s research.

Pepin gave PolitiFact Tennessee an even more precise account. Pepin’s research, which relies on meticulous peer-reviewed studies that include DNA evidence going back decades, concludes that HIV in humans originated in Central Africa, likely sometime in 1921, from a hunter who was exposed to contaminated blood from an ape -- perhaps a chimpanzee -- that was killed for food.

A slow dissemination through Africa followed, Pepin said, through heterosexual transmission, needle injections and blood transfusions. It stayed at a ""low level,"" he says, until 1966 or 1967 when it ""was exported to Haiti"" and ""from there to the United States, probably at the beginning of the 1970s."" Pepin agrees with Campfield on one point: that its spread in North America accelerated through infections transmitted in unprotected sex among gay men.

Apes, not monkeys

We also talked to Beatrice Hahn, a former longtime University of Alabama-Birmingham professor of medicine and microbiology now at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of a 2010 research paper, ""Origin of HIV and AIDS Pandemic."" She clued us into a key distinction -- a monkey is not an ape and an ape is not a monkey. But they are both simians, the animal classification for what are known as ""higher primates.""

She has concluded that the form of HIV most prevalent around the world, known as HIV-1 Group M, originated in chimpanzees -- and chimps are considered apes, not monkeys. Figure 1 in her paper, which cites studies from 150 research papers and was written with Penn colleague Paul Sharp (formerly of University of Edinburgh) features pictures of 10 kinds of simians and has arrows showing how SIV -- ""simian immuno deficiency virus"" -- made a path to humans in two major forms, HIV-1 and HIV-2.

Hahn said HIV-1, the most common AIDS virus, has been documented to have emerged following ""four independent transmissions of ape viruses -- not monkey viruses.""

A second human AIDS virus that is largely restricted to West Africa is called HIV-2, and it is declining and being replaced by HIV-1, according to the paper. That less prevalent form has been traced to a monkey called the Sooty mangabey.

Hahn says the mostly likely way that the simian precursors of HIV-1 and HIV-2 entered the human population was from bushmeat hunters who killed simians for their meat. Pepin and other researchers have written the same thing, and we found no serious academic papers mentioning simian-human sex as a possible transmission route.

""Human infection,"" wrote Martine Peeters of the retrovirus laboratory of the Institute of Research for Development in Montpelier, France, ""is thought to have resulted from cutaneous or mucous membrane exposure to infected blood during the hunting and butchering of chimpanzees and Sooty mangabeys for food. Bites from pet animals and possibly contact with fecal and urine samples may have also been involved.""

Pepin’s book covers the same territory in great detail and cites many studies.

Hahn has appeared on panels with renowned primatologist Jane Goodall to discuss the dangers bushmeat hunting poses. Not only does it endanger species of simians like chimpanzees, there is concern the practice could some day lead to other simian viruses getting passed to humans to create a new pandemic. Scientists remain unsure why SIV does not lead to AIDS in some simians, while HIV causes a deadly condition in humans.

Our ruling

Campfield is unable to provide any convincing evidence to back up his claim and we could find none. The overwhelming scientific research shows Campfield is wrong. Experts believe HIV entered the human population through so-called ""bushmeat"" hunting, and, furthermore, that the predominant HIV-1 form has never been shown to be transmitted directly from monkeys to humans.

Hahn emphasized, too, that there is zero evidence to support the cross-species sex Campfield proposes: ""It surely wasn’t transmitted through sexual activity (with simians)",False Pants on Fire,"February 3, 2012"
"""In 1958, there were 16 states in this country that prohibited -- prohibited -- an African-American and a Caucasian from being married.""","
Gay rights advocates are casting the fight for same-sex marriage as a struggle mirrored in the nation’s past.

""This is a civil rights issue,"" Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver said during a news conference announcing Democratic plans to legalize same-sex marriage in New Jersey.

Oliver recounted the story of an interracial couple forced to leave Virginia in the 1950s or face jail time for being married. The U.S. Supreme Court eventually heard Richard and Mildred Loving’s case and ruled state statutes banning interracial marriage unconstitutional.
 
But, ""in 1958, there were 16 states in this country that prohibited -- prohibited -- an African-American and a Caucasian from being married,"" Oliver (D-Essex) said on Jan. 9. ""Without question, Senator (Stephen) Sweeney said it best: this is a civil rights issue.  It is a snapshot in time in the history of our country issue. And I think for those of us that believe in equality, equality, equality, marriage equality represents the third leg on the stool of civil rights and equality in this country.""

A spokesman said Oliver based her statistic on a New York Times article published earlier this month.  It put the number of states where interracial marriage was illegal in 1958 at 16.

It’s actually more than that, PolitiFact New Jersey found.

Oregon repealed its law in 1951, becoming the first state to do so since Ohio in 1887. Colorado, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota followed suit.

By 1958, two dozen states still prohibited interracial marriage: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming.

Although California still technically had a miscegenation law on its books in 1958, ""once the state Supreme Court declared the law invalid in the 1948 Perez V. Sharp case, it was no longer legally enforceable. So from 1948 on, California is put into the ‘legal column,’"" Renee Romano, the author of ""Race Mixing: Black-White Marriage in Postwar America"" and an associate professor of history at Oberlin College in Ohio, said in an email.

""The Speaker was responsibly relying upon the data graphic included in that New York Times [article],"" Tom Hester Jr., a spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, wrote in an email. ""The Speaker’s overall point was to note that same-sex couples continue to suffer from the same wrongful discrimination that interracial couples such as the Lovings and many, many others endured until the Supreme Court rightly put a stop to it.""

By the time the Supreme Court unanimously ruled miscegenation laws unconstitutional in 1967, 16 states still had such statutes.

""Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual, and cannot be infringed by the State,"" then-Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote in the opinion for the court for the Loving v. Virginia case.

Romano said the analogy between interracial marriage and same-sex marriage isn’t exactly parallel, but it’s powerful.

If you can make the case that 50 years ago people supported bans on interracial marriage, but ""now, we know that it goes on and it’s no big deal, you can sort of use that,"" she said, to say in another 50 years, people may ask ""what the hullabaloo is about. It’s a really powerful analogy. There’s a lot of richness there politically.""

Our ruling

Oliver claimed that 16 states prohibited interracial marriage in 1958. 
There were actually 24 states with legally enforceable statutes banning the marriage of blacks and whites then.

Oliver’s number is off, but the precise figure only further supports her point about discrimination against interracial couples in the 1950s",Mostly True,"January 15, 2012"
"""Opinion polls show that the majority of Americans, and the majority of New Jerseyans, favor marriage equality for same sex couples.""","
Gov. Chris Christie will need some convincing, but Democratic legislators claim they have public opinion on their side as they attempt to legalize same-sex marriage in New Jersey.

""We also must recognize that society is changing for the better, making (Assembly bill) A-1 timely,"" state Assemblyman Reed Gusciora (D-Mercer) said in a Jan. 9 news release. ""Opinion polls show that the majority of Americans, and the majority of New Jerseyans, favor marriage equality for same sex couples.""

Between four national polls and two Rutgers University polls, PolitiFact New Jersey found that Gusciora has the numbers to back up his argument. But two other national polls have indicated there are slightly more opponents than supporters.

""It’s not a solid majority yet, but many polls are showing a majority,"" said Patrick Murray, director of Monmouth University’s Polling Institute. ""(Gusciora is) probably on safe ground with that claim, certainly here in the state of New Jersey.""  

First, let’s talk about the state polls.

In each of two polls conducted last year by the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, 52 percent of New Jersey residents said same-sex marriage should be legal in the Garden State. The most recent poll, which was done in October, found that 39 percent oppose legalizing same-sex marriage.

For the most recent poll, the margin of error attributed to those percentages was 4.7 percent.

""I think it is a fair statement,"" said David Redlawsk, a political science professor and director of the Rutgers-Eagleton poll, referring to Gusciora’s claim. ""Nationally, we’re seeing the same general trend.""

Now, let’s turn to how Americans across the nation view same-sex marriage.

Tom Hester Jr., a spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, pointed to a Gallup poll conducted in May, when 53 percent of respondents said same-sex marriage should be legal. That figure marked a nine percent increase over a 2010 poll asking the same question. The margin of error for the May poll was 4 percent.

We also found three other national polls that demonstrate similar support for same-sex marriage.

Two ABC News/Washington Post polls conducted last year put the level of support at slightly more than 50 percent. A CNN poll done in April also found that 51 percent of respondents support legalizing same-sex marriage. The margins of error for those polls was 3.5 percent.

However, when you factor in the margins of error, a majority of Americans might only support same-sex marriage based on one of those four national polls.

Also, two other national polls conducted last year suggest that opposition to same-sex marriage remains strong.

A Pew Research Center poll done in late February and early March found that 45 percent of respondents support same-sex marriage and 46 percent oppose it. That poll had a margin of error of 3 percent.

In July, a Quinnipiac University poll determined that 48 percent of registered voters would oppose a state law legalizing same-sex marriage and 46 percent would support one. The margin of error was 2 percent.

Still, both of those polls demonstrate that public support for same-sex marriage has increased. Compared to a Quinnipiac University poll conducted in April 2009, the percentage of respondents who support a state law allowing same-sex marriage has increased by 8 percent.

Hester defended Gusciora’s claim in an email: ""Polls have shown support for marriage equality. Assemblyman Gusciora accurately and responsibly cited those polls. His statement was true.""

Our ruling

Gusciora claimed, ""Opinion polls show that the majority of Americans, and the majority of New Jerseyans, favor marriage equality for same sex couples.""

Two state polls and four national polls show that slightly more than 50 percent of respondents support legalizing same-sex marriage. But the margins of error among those national polls could mean greater support than opposition in only one of those polls.

Two other national polls also suggest a closely divided electorate, but still show that public support for same-sex marriage has increased in recent years",Mostly True,"January 12, 2012"
"Congressional Republicans have introduced dozens of bills on social issues and other topics, but ""zero on job creation.""","
A reader recently sent us a post circulating on Facebook and on blogs that blames the House Republican majority for focusing their legislation on lots of topics -- except for job creation. Here’s the text of the chart:

""The numbers: Republicans have introduced 44 bills on abortion, 99 on religion, 71 on family relationships, 36 on marriage, 67 on firearms/gun control, 522 on taxation, 445 on ‘government investigations,’ and zero on job creation.""

It cites as its source a post on the liberal website Daily Kos written on Oct. 21, 2011, by Minnesota-based blogger and self-described ""unrepentant liberal"" Myles Spicer,

""Given that these Representatives were elected to pass job creation bills so needed by our country, what has the House been doing this past year?"" Spicer asked in his post. ""Well, mostly they have occupied themselves with a variety of social, moral and value issues. ... The Congressional Research Service (CRS, a non-partisan arm of Congress that tracks such things) offers an appalling look at our current Congress’ activities.

""They have introduced 44 bills on abortion (one just the other day reaffirming existing legislation on this subject). 99 on religion. 71 on family relationships. 36 on marriage. 67 on firearms and gun control. 552 on taxation—and though most were to reduce taxes, there have been no significant changes on tax law with all time invested and bills introduced. And finally a massive 445 bills on ‘government investigations.’ There is a category labeled ‘job creation legislation’ originated by Congress, and tracked by the CRS. In that category the CRS reported: ‘No bills at this time. The Congressional Research Service has not tagged any bills in the current session of Congress with this issue area.’  If ever the analogy of ‘rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic’ was apt, this is it!""

We wondered about the accuracy of the post based on Spicer’s argument, so we took a look.

We didn’t find anything about legislative subject headings at CRS’ own website, but we did find a list of subjects for current legislation at THOMAS, the legislative-tracking website run by the Library of Congress.

Using THOMAS, you can search bills that have been offered during the current Congress -- the 112th -- by their CRS subject matter. The list of subject areas begins in alphabetical order here.

When comparing the numbers, we allowed for some variation due to the list being continuously updated as new bills are introduced. That said, we found that the numbers in the Internet post were quite close to what was listed in THOMAS for abortion, religion, family relationships, marriage, firearms, taxation and government investigations.

What about ""job creation""? As it turned out, we couldn’t find a topic area by that name at all.

We located Spicer and asked him for his sourcing. He told us he had used the website opencongress.org, a non-profit, non-partisan database of legislative and other congressional data. He pointed us to this page, where a category of bills categorized under ""job creation"" is listed. ""Job creation"" had zero entries.

We quickly noticed two things about the database. First, the numbers cited on opencongress.org for the social issues and other topics in the chart were close to what THOMAS had -- in other words, they closely followed the CRS subject headings. And second, ""job creation"" was only one of many, many topics that had zero bills associated with it in the opencongress.org database.

We reached David Moore, executive director of the Participatory Politics Foundation, which runs opencongress.org. He said that his website displays not only CRS issue labels used for bills pending in the current Congress but also labels that have been used at least once in the past three Congresses, even if none have been applied yet to bills in the 112th Congress.

By Moore’s count, opencongress.org includes 4,795 issue areas in all. But only a fraction of these subject headings have any bills listed under them, because CRS has not tagged any bills with those headings during the current Congress.

We did not hear back from CRS or THOMAS, so we don’t know why CRS has used the ""job creation"" label in the past but not this year.

However, our research suggests that the lack of bills labeled ""job creation"" this year doesn't mean there have been no bills aimed at promoting employment introduced in the current Congress.

Why? The House version of President Barack Obama’s American Jobs Act -- which we’re sure the president and his supporters would characterize as a ""job creation"" bill -- doesn’t even get slapped with that subject heading.

The bill -- officially H.R. 12, introduced on Sept. 21, 2011, by Rep. John Larson, D-Conn. -- is listed under no fewer than 68 separate subject headings, including ""aviation and airports,"" ""Buy American requirements,"" ""electric power generation and transmission,"" ""Internet and video services,"" ""metals,"" ""solid waste and recycling"" and ""water use and supply.""

But it doesn’t carry the label ""job creation.""

Instead, several closely related subjects have been applied to H.R. 12, including ""economic development,"" ""economic performance and conditions,"" ""employee hiring,"" ""employment and training programs,"" ""labor and employment,"" ""unemployment"" and ""wages and earnings.""

And how many bills have been introduced under these other headings? Here’s the list. (Some bills may be included in more than one category.)

Economic development: 64 bills
Economic performance and conditions: 55 bills
Employee hiring: 24 bills
Employment and training programs: 172 bills
Labor and employment: 151 bills
Unemployment: 107 bills
Wages and earnings: 143 bills

In reality, then, six of these seven jobs-related categories included more bills than either abortion or marriage, and four of the seven included more bills than religion, family relationships or firearms.

We see a few additional problems with the post.

It’s wrong to say that only Republicans sponsored bills on social issues, taxation and government investigations.

For every legislative subject cited in the ad, the THOMAS list includes bills introduced both by Republicans and Democrats. We checked each topic area to make sure that Democrats had offered bills on those topics, and in each case, they did. So it’s wrong for the post to say that ""Republicans have introduced"" that many bills. Both parties have. (Spicer, to his credit, did not make this mistake; the creator of the subsequent post did. ""When I state that these folks were elected to get us more jobs, I did not exclude the Democrats,"" Spicer told PolitiFact.)

It’s wrong to point to this data as evidence that Republicans are going hog wild on ""government investigations.""

To be sure, Republicans are using their control of House committees to probe government operations, including potential corruption and scandals. (The Democrats did the same after 2006 when they controlled Congress and George W. Bush was in the White House.) But it’s wrong to suggest that the 445 ""government investigation"" bills amount to evidence in support of this tendency.

Most of the bills tagged with this category are there because they contain some sort of oversight mechanism, such as defining who will oversee a newly created federal program and how. So most of these bills involve run-of-the-mill government oversight mechanisms, not an effort to gin up high-profile administration scandals.

Keep in mind that these categories are very broad.

Labeling a bill with a subject category doesn’t mean the bill is primarily about that issue. For instance, a very, very large number of congressional bills have some impact on the tax code, even if it’s tangential. That’s why so many bills get categorized as being tax-related.

To one degree or another for the other, this pattern holds for subject headings, too. The ""religion"" category doesn’t just include bills of interest to conservative Christians, as someone reading the post might assume. It also includes the ""Noose Hate Crime Act of 2011,"" sponsored by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas and the ""Veterans, Women, Families with Children, and Persons With Disabilities Housing Fairness Act of 2011,"" sponsored by Rep. Al Green, D-Texas.

""Job creation"" means different things to different parties.

Most conservatives today are dead-set against traditional forms of government-based economic stimulus known as Keynesian economics, primarily spending initiatives. So if ""job creation"" is defined to primarily include Keynesian initiatives, then Republicans aren’t going to be sponsoring any ""job creation"" bills. Instead, Republicans argue that tax cuts and budget cutting will help the economy prosper.

Our ruling

While congressional Republicans have certainly introduced dozens of bills on social issues and other topics, the  claim that the GOP has focused on issues other than job creation just isn't supported. The numbers cited in the post include Democratic bills, and the definition of what constitutes a ""job creation"" bill is open to significant debate.

But the post’s most important flaw is the contention that Republicans have offered ""zero"" bills on job creation. This number stems from a methodology that also excludes Obama’s American Jobs Act from the category of ""job creation"" bills. If  you look at alternative job-related subject headings, the number of bills offered by lawmakers from both parties actually exceeds most of the social-issues listed in the blog post",False Pants on Fire,"October 25, 2011"
Says Rick Perry flip-flopped on gay marriage by first saying it was a state’s rights issue and then saying he was in favor of a federal constitutional amendment banning gay marriage.,"
In a column in POLITICO Aug. 12, 2011, former Texas congressman and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee head Martin Frost argued that Texas Gov. Rick Perry may not be ready for the increased scrutiny of a presidential campaign.

""Perry demonstrated that he may not be ready for prime time with how he handled the gay marriage issue. First, Perry said that he didn’t have any problem with states like New York approving gay marriage — though he didn’t think it was appropriate for Texas. It was a state's rights issue,"" Frost wrote.

""However, after getting strong pushback from the religious right community, Perry changed his position, saying he was in favor of a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage everywhere. ""

We'll explore Frost's claim in two parts. Did Perry say it was a states' rights issue? And did he then shift his stance to support an amendment?

Frost told us he was out of the country for two weeks and wouldn't be able to provide additional information about his claim. We called and e-mailed Perry's campaign and did not receive a response.

State's rights: 'That's New York, and that's their business'

Perry addressed the state's rights question when he spoke to a Republican Governors Association forum at the Aspen Institute in Colorado on July 22, 2011. Here's how the Associated Press reported it:

Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a potential Republican presidential candidate, said Friday he supports state rights so much that he's fine with New York's approval of gay marriage but still called himself an ""unapologetic social conservative.""

Perry, who has been weighing a presidential run, said he opposes gay marriage — but that he's also a firm believer of the 10th Amendment.

""Our friends in New York six weeks ago passed a statute that said marriage can be between two people of the same sex. And you know what? That's New York, and that's their business, and that's fine with me,"" he said to applause from several hundred GOP donors in Aspen, Colo. ""That is their call. If you believe in the 10th Amendment, stay out of their business.""

So Perry was strongly in favor of state's rights. But soon after, social conservatives including former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who is also running for the nomination, attacked Perry for his stance.

""So Gov Perry, if a state wanted to allow polygamy, or if they chose to deny heterosexuals the right to marry, would that be OK too?"" Santorum tweeted after the speech.

Supporting a federal constitutional amendment

Six days later, the Texas governor added this explanation in an appearance with Family Research Council President Tony Perkins:

""I probably needed to add a few words after that 'it's fine with me,' and that it's fine with me that a state is using their sovereign rights to decide an issue. Obviously gay marriage is not fine with me. My stance hasn't changed,"" he said. ""I believe marriage is a union between one man and one woman.""

Perry pointed to his efforts to pass a defense of marriage act in Texas. In 2003, Perry signed a bill specifying that Texas does not legally recognize a same-sex marriage or civil union. Two years later, he supported strengthening the law with the Texas Marriage Amendment, defining marriage as the ""union of one man and one woman."" The amendment was approved by Texas voters in November 2005.

During his conversation with Perkins, Perry also endorsed a federal marriage amendment. He said it is being offered out of concern that ""activist"" judges would impose a different definition of marriage on the states. ""Indeed, to not pass the federal marriage amendment would impinge on Texas and other states not to have marriage forced upon us by these activist judges and special interest groups.""

Was that a shift for Perry? We scoured books and newspaper databases and couldn't find any other comments from him that directly address a federal amendment, although we did find a column from Feb. 19, 2009, in the Austin American-Statesman in which he obliquely addressed it. Speaking of leaders in Washington, he said, ""Can you imagine if they built a constitutional firewall around traditional marriage?"" That comment implied that he supported such an amendment.

Activists on both sides of the issue also told us he was a supporter of such an amendment before his remarks a few weeks ago.

Kelly Shackelford, president of the Liberty Institute, which describes itself as ""guided by principles that limit government and promote Judeo-Christian values,"" said that Perry has ""been in favor of a federal marriage amendment for a long time.""

He said Perry favors the federal constitutional amendment because he is concerned that without it, ""the courts will take it out of our hands."" Shackelford said Perry's position is consistent with his strong support for the 10th amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which says, ""The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.""

Since a proposed amendment must be ratified by three-fourths of the states, it provides an opportunity for the states to speak, according to Shackelford.

Dennis Coleman, executive director of Equality Texas, which opposes discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, also said that Perry has supported a federal constitutional amendment on marriage in the past, as well as the state amendment. ""He does believe in states rights,"" said Coleman, but Perry also holds a position that ""it should not be legislated from the bench. It should be decided by the people.""

After the flap in July, Perry spokesman Mark Miner was quoted in the Austin American-Statesman also affirming that Perry supported a federal constitutional amendment defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman. ""Nothing has changed with the governor's philosophy here,"" the Statesman quoted him saying.

Still, in Perry's discussions of the issue prior to the dust-up over his remarks at the National Governors Association, he has emphasized states' rights rather than support for a constitutional amendment.

Here's how his position was summed up in an interview in the April 4, 2011, issue of the conservative National Review:

""Here's something you won't hear an up-and-down-the-line conservative like Perry saying all that often: 'If you don't like medical marijuana and gay marriage, don't move to California.' ...Perry is content for Californians to let their freak flags fly, though he confesses that he recoils from some of the implications of his hard-line constitutionalism: The thought of flag-burning, for instance, makes Rick Perry one angry Eagle Scot. But his laissez-faire attitude is surprisingly broad … 'don't make me accept it as normal,' Perry says, 'and do not make me pay for it. But that's classic Tenth Amendment, and I'll fight to the death for California's right to decide for themselves how they want to live.'""

The interview contained no mention of the federal constitutional amendment on marriage, although it did quote Perry saying: ""I have no problem changing the Constitution from time to time: I want a balanced-budget amendment. There’s a process for that, for amending the Constitution.""

Perry's 2010 manifesto, Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington, strongly endorses states' rights but does not discuss a federal constitutional amendment on gay marriage.

""If you don't support the death penalty and citizens packing a pistol, don't come to Texas. If you don't like medical marijuana and gay marriage, don't move to California …

""I would no more consider living in Massachusetts than I suspect a great number of folks from Massachusetts would like to live in Texas. We just don't agree on a number of things. They passed state-run health care, they have sanctioned gay marriage.""

Perry does mention his concerns about the courts imposing their views of marriage on states:

""Gay marriage will soon be the policy of the United States, irrespective of federalism, the Constitution or the wishes of the American people. Not because it is actually protected in the Constitution, but because judges will declare it so.""

He does not go on, however, to argue that a federal constitutional amendment is needed to head off this result. He makes no mention of it at all in the section of the book called, ""Our Ability to Define Marriage.""

Nor does he mention such an amendment in his final chapter, ""Retaking the Reins of Government: Freedom and Federalism for the Future."" He does, however discuss the need to ""amend the Constitution -- now -- to restrict federal spending."" and the option of repealing the 16th Amendment, which provides for income tax.

Our ruling

Frost claims that Perry has flip-flopped on the issue and didn't bring up the amendment until a conservative outcry about his states' rights remarks.

We find some merit to Frost's claim because Perry did, indeed, bring up his support for the amendment after his remarks about gay marriage in New York stirred up a storm. And we found little evidence that he talked about it much before that. Instead, he emphasized a view that states should decide for themselves.

Still, activists on both sides of the issue as well as his spokesman said Perry supported the amendment long before his recent comments. And he has consistently raised a concern that the courts might force acceptance of same sex marriage on states that disapprove, which is his rationale for supporting a federal constitutional amendment.

Frost is right that Perry changed in the face of criticism, but the change appears not to have been so much a change in policy as a change in rhetorical emphasis designed to quiet critics",Mostly False,"August 19, 2011"
"""Josh Mandel used to be pro-choice, now he’s anti-choice. He used to be sympathetic towards gay and lesbians and now he’s [not].""","
Former Gov. Ted Strickland recently pulled a page from the Ohio Democratic Party’s playbook to attack Josh Mandel, the Republican state treasurer who now appears to be running for the U.S. Senate.

Mandel, 33, hasn’t formally announced his candidacy but is raising money for the race and taking shots from Democrats as if he’s an official candidate.

Mandel, a former state legislator from Lyndhurst, has his eye on the seat held by Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Avon.

Strickland took up for his fellow Democrat in a recent interview with Politico, a national political news website. Strickland framed Mandel as a candidate willing to shift his ideals to further his political career.

Strickland told Politico that Mandel – whose likely Senate run has gained the support of the Senate Conservatives Fund – has not always been so staunchly conservative.

""Josh Mandel used to be pro-choice, now he’s anti-choice,"" Strickland said. ""He used to be sympathetic towards gay and lesbians and now he’s [not].""

Democrats have portrayed Mandel as a political opportunist going back to his run last year for state treasurer, so PolitiFact Ohio decided to check Strickland’s claim to see if Mandel is the shape-shifter his opponents have made him out to be.

Let’s slice Strickland’s attack in half, examining the accuracy of each claim.

There is no question Mandel is now anti-abortion. He has endorsed the ""heartbeat bill,"" a controversial proposed law banning abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected, which can occur as early as six weeks into a pregnancy.

When asked about Strickland’s comments, a spokesman for Mandel’s campaign said, ""Josh has always been solidly pro-life and believes all innocent human life should be protected.""

When we talked to Strickland, he said that Mandel seemed to grow more stringent in his anti-abortion views over time, culminating with his support of the heartbeat bill. Mandel supported exceptions to anti-abortion laws for cases of rape and incest, according to an Ohio Right to Life 2006 candidate survey. On a similar survey two years later, he didn’t list those exceptions to qualify his support for anti-abortion laws.

Ultimately, Strickland said he has no evidence to show Mandel ever supported abortion rights.

""I’m just going to have to be straight with you, I can’t give you a document or recording that supports what I said,"" Strickland said.

So Strickland’s claim that Mandel used to be ""pro-choice"" is unsupported. But did Mandel change course on his support for the gay community?

When we asked the former governor to back up that part of his statement, Strickland cited quotes from Mandel when he was involved in student government in college, and compared those words with Mandel’s more recent legislative voting record.

Mandel was president of the undergraduate student government while he attended Ohio State University. In April 2000, the student government voted to support a domestic partnership plan to allow qualified students to buy student health insurance for their domestic partners, according to The Lantern, Ohio State’s student newspaper.

Mandel supported the plan at the time.

""The undergraduate student government representatives have been and will continue to advocate for domestic partner benefits in public and private settings,"" Mandel told The Lantern. ""Students want it, students deserve it and the university has a responsibility to provide it.""

Despite his support for domestic partner benefits in 2000, Mandel nine years later voted against a bill to shield gay and transgender Ohioans from being discriminated against in housing and employment issues.

House Bill 176 sought to add sexual orientation and gender identity to the list of classifications for which it is illegal to discriminate for housing, employment and public-accommodation purposes. The bill passed the Democrat-controlled House by a vote of 56-39, with five Republicans joining Democrats to support the measure. But the bill did not go anywhere in the Republican-controlled Senate.

Mandel voted against the bill. He was not among a handful of Republicans to explain their vote on the House floor that day.

Mandel’s campaign now says he was wrong in college.

""Josh has always opposed discrimination against any American citizen and has also always believed that marriage is between one man and one woman,"" his spokesman, Anthony Conchel, said in a statement. ""He also feels he was wrong in college about domestic partner benefits and feels strongly that they should never be funded with taxpayer dollars.""

So where does that leave us?

Strickland claimed Mandel reversed his stances on two social issues – abortion and gay rights.

On the latter, Mandel’s legislative voting record and recent statements do not match up with his position in college, and the treasurer now says he was wrong in college.

Mandel said he’s always held the same view on abortion rights, and Strickland cannot prove otherwise. So we have to conclude Strickland was wrong there",Half True,"August 16, 2011"
"""Polls now show a majority of Catholics favor marriage equality.""","
Last weekend was ""bittersweet"" for Steven Goldstein.

Same-sex couples could wed legally in New York, while Goldstein, the head of the gay rights advocacy group Garden State Equality, said New Jersey is ""still denied that freedom.""

Goldstein, whose group filed a lawsuit this summer aiming to legalize same-sex marriage in New Jersey, argued in a July 24 column published in The Sunday Star-Ledger’s Perspective section that New Jersey’s civil union law doesn’t provide real equality.

""The governor cites his faith as a basis for his opposition to marriage equality,"" wrote Goldstein. ""But no faith is monolithic on any issue. Polls now show a majority of Catholics favor marriage equality, as does the general electorate.""

Do a majority of Catholics really favor gay marriage?

Goldstein provided PolitiFact New Jersey with two national surveys to support his statement, and they mostly do.

First, let’s note that both polls -- and another survey we found -- highlighted the views of white Catholics. Pollsters said this is done to control for race and because white Catholics are considered a swing voter group. But we’re going to look at all Catholics since Goldstein didn’t distinguish.

Also, because the Catholics made up a smaller group than the poll sample, the margins of error are higher.

An ABC News/Washington Post poll released in March asked 1,005 adults, ""do you think it should be legal or illegal for gay and lesbian couples to get married?"" It found that among those who identified themselves as Catholic, 60 percent support same-sex marriage and 38 percent oppose it, with a 7.5 percentage point margin of error.  

A Public Religion Research Institute poll released in May surveyed 1,007 adults. It asked respondents whether they strongly favor, favor, oppose or strongly oppose ""allowing gay and lesbian couples to legally marry.""

It found among the Catholics surveyed, 56 percent either favored or strongly favored and 36 percent either opposed or strongly opposed, with a margin of error of 7 percentage points.

It’s worth noting that in another national poll by the Public Religion Research Institute from September 2010, when Catholics were given the option of choosing civil unions, support for marriage dipped.

It found that of the Catholics surveyed, 43 percent said gay couples should be allowed to marry, 31 percent said gay couples should be allowed to form civil unions but not marry and 22 percent said there should be no legal recognition of a gay couple’s relationship. It’s also worth noting that in that poll, the more often Catholics said they went to church, the less likely they were to support same-sex marriage.

A national Quinnipiac University poll released in July that asked 2,311 registered voters whether they ""would support or oppose a law in your state that would same-sex couples to get married?""

Of the Catholics surveyed, 53 percent said they would support such a law in their state and 41 percent said they would oppose, with a margin of error of 4.9 percentage points.

Mark Gray, a research associate with the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, pointed to his analysis of 2010 data from the General Social Survey, which found that 48 percent of Catholics either strongly agreed or agreed that ""homosexual couples should have the right to marry one another"" and 36 percent disagreed or strongly disagreed, with a 5.8 percentage point margin of error.

""Right now at this point you can’t really say it’s a majority, you can’t really say it’s not a majority, given the margin of error,"" Gray said.

Michele Dillon, chair of University of New Hampshire’s department of sociology, said ""the actual percentage varies poll to poll, it’s either close or over 50 percent,"" but, ""the momentum is in favor of same-sex marriage"" -- both nationally and among Catholics.

Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League, said ""there’s no question there’s been a movement"" in favor of same-sex marriage, mostly driven by a younger generation. Young people, ""including young Catholics, are far more likely to be supportive of gay marriage,"" he said.

But, Donohue argued, ""people tend to be a bit more liberal"" when asked their opinion on the phone, ""as opposed to the privacy of the ballot box.""

Back to Goldstein’s statement.

Goldstein said, ""polls now show a majority of Catholics favor marriage equality."" We found polls generally support his claim",Mostly True,"July 31, 2011"
"Says scientists are ""in dispute"" over whether being gay is a choice.","
During a July 10, 2011, appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press, host David Gregory asked Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty about the origins of homosexuality. Here’s their exchange:

Gregory: ""Let me ask you about social policy. You've notably said that you're a big fan of Lady Gaga and even the song Born This Way. There's a lot of debate about a gay marriage pledge in Iowa. And related to that, I wonder, do you agree with some of those who are behind that, that being gay is a choice?""

Pawlenty: ""Well, I have two teenage daughters who listen to Lady Gaga, so I'm subjected to it. And it has some good qualities to it. But as to, as to gay marriage, I'm in support of traditional marriage as between a man and a woman. I have not supported the issues of allowing gay couples to have the same benefits … as traditional couples. And so this is an issue in Iowa and across the whole country. But I've stood in favor of traditional marriage and traditional relationships in that regard.

Gregory: ""Is being gay a choice?""

Pawlenty: ""Well, the science in that regard is in dispute. I mean, the scientists work on that and try to figure out if it's behavioral...""

Gregory: ""Right.""

Pawlenty: ""...or if it's partly genetic.""

Gregory:""What do you think?""

Pawlenty: ""Well, I defer to the scientists in that regard.""

Gregory: ""So you, you think it's not a choice.""

Pawlenty: ""Well, there is no....""

Gregory: ""That you are, as Lady Gaga says, you're ‘born that way.’""

Pawlenty: ""There's no scientific conclusion that it's genetic. We don't know that. So we don't know to what extent, you know, it's behavioral, and that's something that's been debated by scientists for a long time. But as I understand the science, there's no current conclusion that it's genetic.""

We decided to rate two of Pawlenty’s statements separately. In another item, we’ll look at his claim that ""there's no scientific conclusion that it's genetic."" In this item, we’ll look at the first part of the exchange. We're not fact checking whether being gay is a choice, but whether scientists are ""in dispute"" over whether it is or is not.

We’ll start out by noting an important difference -- the difference between sexual orientation and sexual behavior.

Scientists don’t doubt that it’s possible for someone who’s gay to choose, through sheer willpower, to ignore their impulses and abstain from homosexual activity. Both gay and straight people have been going celibate by choice since time immemorial. But scientists add that for such people, sexual impulses don’t go away.

So, scientists argue, even if sexual behavior is a choice, sexual orientation -- the state of being gay, and the impulses one feels -- is not a choice.

""We only choose to act, and our actions are influenced by desires,"" said Michael Bailey, a Northwestern University psychologist who specializes in the origins of homosexuality. ""So I think that in an ordinary understanding of ‘choice,’ sexual orientation -- i.e., increased sexual desire for one type of person -- is not chosen, but sexual behavior is.""

Both the American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association -- the two leading organizations for their professions -- reject the idea that the driving factor in determining one’s sexual orientation is personal choice.

A spokeswoman for the American Psychiatric Association -- which has about 36,000 members out of roughly 48,000 psychiatrists nationwide --  didn’t recall any significant internal dissension in recent years over the question of whether sexual orientation is a choice. Meanwhile, the American Psychological Association, which has 150,000 members, also considers it a ""settled question"" that homosexuality isn’t a choice, said Clinton W. Anderson, the associate executive director of the American Psychological Association and the director of its lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender concerns office.

Interestingly, we found less division than we’d expected between gay-rights advocates and social conservatives.

Michael Cole-Schwartz -- a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, a leading gay advocacy group -- said that ""there is significant agreement that one does not choose one’s sexual orientation.""

Meanwhile, Peter Sprigg, a senior fellow at the Family Research Council -- a leading think tank for social conservatives -- agreed with the distinction between orientation and behavior. He suggested that fuzzy definitions of ""sexual orientation"" explain why the two camps sometimes talk past each other.

""Part of the problem is that the term ‘sexual orientation’ is somewhat ambiguous,"" Sprigg said. He suggests that it is sometimes used to cover three separate elements -- attractions, behaviors and self-identification.

""What I generally say is that I don‘t believe that same-sex attractions are a choice, but behaviors and self-identification are,"" he said. ""If Pawlenty had wanted to be more subtle, he could have asked Gregory what he meant"" by being gay.

In fact, Sprigg articulated his somewhat nuanced view on the Family Research Council website in 2010, in a document titled ""The Top Ten Myths About Homosexuality."" In it, he reviewed some of the studies on this topic and concluded that ""if it was not clear in the 1990’s, it certainly is now—no one is ‘born gay.’"" Yet he went on to write that ""homosexual attractions are clearly not a ‘choice’ in the vast majority of cases.""

In an interview, Sprigg said he didn’t see the two statements as contradictory.

""When I say it’s clear that no one is born gay, I don’t think any of those three factors"" -- attractions, behaviors and self-identification -- ""are fixed and determined at birth. Just because it’s not a choice doesn’t mean it’s present at birth. It could be the result of developmental factors in childhood. Sometime between the time you’re born and the time you begin to experience sexual attraction, things can happen that can affect your development.""

He even pointed to an American Psychological Association statement that ""although much research has examined the possible genetic, hormonal, developmental, social, and cultural influences on sexual orientation, no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation – heterosexuality, homosexuality, or bisexuality -- is determined by any particular factor or factors.""

The scientists we spoke to freely acknowledged that much is unknown about what determines sexual orientation. (More on that in our accompanying item.) But what scientists do know pretty much rules out the idea that homosexuality is simply a choice.

At this point, we need to note an important caveat: What we’ve been discussing here applies primarily to gay men. There is actually no solid scientific consensus about the causes of female homosexuality, because the research on that question has been much less extensive.

We struggled with the question of how we should factor in what one might call the lesbian exception to the scientific consensus on homosexuality. Neither Pawlenty nor Gregory specifically referred to either gay men or gay women in their comments. Ultimately, we concluded that the science of what causes women to be gay was too unformed to draw any solid conclusions, so we set it aside as a factor in our ratings.

So where does this leave us?

Pawlenty said that scientists are ""in dispute"" about whether being gay is a choice or not. We think most people would interpret that to mean sexual orientation -- that is, attractions and impulses -- rather than sexual behavior. And on that question, it seems that the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the Human Rights Campaign and even the Family Research Council are in agreement",False,"July 13, 2011"

Pawlenty’s word choice -- ""genetic"" -- is pivotal for rating the accuracy of his claim. The way he phrased it, he’s pretty close to accurate. But if he’d said instead that ""there's no scientific conclusion that (being gay) is biological,"" he would have been incorrect.

Since the significance of this distinction may not be obvious at first glance, we’ll explain it in detail here.

If a trait is ""genetic,"" it means that it comes from the genes encoded in your DNA. Furthermore, arguing that something is genetic suggests that there’s a single, or at least a well-defined, genetic source -- what has sometimes been called a ""gay gene.""

By contrast, if a trait is ""biological"" in origin, it means that it can stem from any number of factors, such as hormone levels or how a fetus develops in the uterus. It would not, however, originate primarily from environmental factors such as childhood experiences -- what one might call the ""nurture"" part of the nature/nurture divide.

The typical way of figuring out whether something is caused by genes is through twin studies. Since identical twins share 100 percent of their DNA, any observed differences in traits would be presumed to be influenced by environment rather than genetics. So if being gay was truly, and exclusively, a genetic trait, every set of identical twins should either be both straight, or both gay.

In fact, that’s not the case. Even the studies with the strongest linkage show about a 50 percent correlation in sexual orientation between identical twins. Other studies have shown lower rates. Based on these findings, scientists agree that being gay is not caused exclusively by genes.

However, being gay does appear to have a genetic component -- just a weaker one. The same study that showed roughly a 50 percent correlation in sexual orientation between identical twins also showed weaker correlations for fraternal twins, who share only 50 percent of their genes on average. That’s pretty much what you’d expect to see if genetics played a role, but not a dominant one.

""Pawlenty is surely right that a genetic explanation has not been proven, and indeed genetics is likely a modest influence on sexual orientation,"" said Michael Bailey, a Northwestern University psychologist who undertook the twin study that showed a 50 percent correlation, as well as another that showed lower correlations.

But if being gay is not primarily determined by genes, it doesn’t mean that its origin isn’t biological.

Bailey and others find some of the most convincing evidence of the inherent nature of sexual orientation in long-term studies of the rare cases in which hormonally normal boys are reared as girls due to either accidents or certain medical conditions that have left them less obviously male. He said there have been six published cases of hormonally normal males reassigned early as females, and invariably, their sexual orientation was toward females. That’s consistent with their prenatal gender, not with their rearing as girls.

The point of these studies is that sexual orientation -- one’s attractions and impulses -- runs very deep and is resistant to social and environmental factors.

""If you can't make a male attracted to other males by cutting off his penis, castrating him, and rearing him as a girl, how likely is any social explanation of male homosexuality?"" Bailey asks.

Scientists freely acknowledge that the precise pathways for imparting sexual orientation are not yet understood. ""Although much research has examined the possible genetic, hormonal, developmental, social and cultural influences on sexual orientation, no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation – heterosexuality, homosexuality or bisexuality -- is determined by any particular factor or factors,"" the American Psychological Association has put it.

However, just because scientists don’t know the specific mechanisms that cause sexual orientation doesn’t mean that they aren’t confident that they are biological in nature.

""We do not really know in any definitive way the mix between biological and other explanations, but the evidence for biological contributions is as good or better than for any other factor,"" said Clinton W. Anderson, the associate executive director of the American Psychological Association and the director of its lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender concerns office. ""Some have suggested that it’s how you were reared or a failure in bonding to the same-sex parent. But the research to support that is abysmal.""

Jack Drescher, a distinguished fellow of the American Psychiatric Association, added that ""you’d be hard-pressed to find a reputable scientist who would exclude some aspect of biology"" from the causes of homosexuality. Drescher is a member of the working group on sexual and gender-identity disorders for the forthcoming fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM 5-- the authoritative reference work in the field.

At this point, we need to note an important caveat: What we’ve been discussing here applies primarily to gay men. There is actually no solid scientific consensus about the causes of female homosexuality, because the research has been much less extensive.

We struggled with the question of how we should factor in what one might call the lesbian exception. Neither Pawlenty nor Gregory specifically referred to either gay men or gay women in their comments. Ultimately, we concluded that the science of what causes women to be gay was too unformed to draw any solid conclusions, so we set it aside as a factor in our ratings.

So where does this leave us?

Pawlenty said ""there's no scientific conclusion that (being gay) is genetic."" On that specific question, we found broad agreement that Pawlenty was correct. Scientists told us that genetics may play a role in determining sexual orientation, but the current evidence suggests that it’s not the dominant factor and may ultimately be shown to play just a modest role.

But a modest role is still different from no role. And we also think that viewers of the interview might be led to believe that because homosexuality is not primarily caused by genes, there’s no biological cause. In reality, most scientists do believe that sexual orientation is caused by biology, rather than by choice",Mostly True,"July 13, 2011"
"""Full marriage equality [would provide same-sex couples] with about 1,700 rights.""","
In the debate over same-sex marriage, proponents have argued that proposals to create civil unions and other arrangements to mimic marriage are unacceptable. They contend that such measures fail to provide for the same rights and benefits received by couples in traditional marriage.

One such proposal, which would allow any two unmarried persons in Rhode Island to establish ""reciprocal beneficiary agreements"" received a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee April 5.

Bill Fischer, spokesman for the advocacy group Marriage Equality Rhode Island, said in an interview with The Journal that the proposal wouldn't come close to providing the full benefits of marriage to gay couples. And, he said, there are lots of benefits.

""We've been asked a lot lately regarding full marriage versus civil union versus reciprocal benefits, what it actually means. And I think it’s important to note [that] reciprocal benefits would provide same-sex couples with approximately 15 rights, civil unions with about 600 rights, and full marriage equality with about 1,700 rights. There is a real distinction in approach,"" he said.

Supporters of same-sex marriage often cite a large number of federal rights -- usually 1,100 or so -- that they say are denied to same-sex couples because gay marriage is not recognized under federal law.

Many examples are substantive and well-documented. Gay couples lose out on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and veterans benefits that would normally go to a spouse. They can't transfer property between themselves without possibly incurring a tax penalty, a concern married couples don't face.

They aren't protected by the COBRA law or the Family Medical Leave Act the way the spouse of an unemployed person is. Death benefits don't automatically go to the partner in a gay marriage the way they go to a widow or widower.

But when we heard Fischer cite the 1,700 figure, we wanted to know if there really are 1,700 rights to be gained by being married.

So we asked for the list.

He said it was the combination of about 600 state and roughly 1,100 federal rights denied to gay couples in Rhode Island. To prove it, he sent us three documents.

The first was a 1997 report from the U.S. General Accounting Office that, in the wake of the Defense of Marriage Act of 1996, identified ""1,049 federal laws classified to the United States Code in which marital status is a factor.""

Given the number of times the 1,100 number has been tossed around, we expected to see a specific analysis of each law cited, or at least some indication of what ""right"" was at stake.

Instead, we were surprised to discover that the GAO had simply done a search of the U.S. Code to identify laws that use words or word fragments like ""marr"" (for marriage), ""spouse,"" ""widow"" or ""survivor.""

In fact, the report itself cautions that ""some of these laws may not directly create benefits, rights, or privileges."" It also warns that ""no conclusions can be drawn … concerning the effect of the law on married people versus single people. A particular law may create either advantages or disadvantages for those who are married, or may apply to both married and single people.""

The second document was a 2004 update to that GAO report, which used the same methodology. The new tally: 1,138.

So already, given the GAO’s methodology and multiple caveats, we were skeptical. But we decided to examine a sample of the laws the GAO identified.

For this item, we are loosely defining ""rights"" to include benefits and privileges that people enjoy as a result of a law.

We looked at 35 laws -- particularly the ones where their titles made us wonder whether the statute offered a real right, benefit or privilege for being hitched. We discovered that the GAO's cautionary language was well warranted.

In most of the cases, 26 of the 35, the language, by our reading, does in fact give rights to people who are married, although some of the rights were pretty obscure:

* A section of Title 2, Chapter 16 gives surviving spouses of current, past or future members of the U.S. House of Representatives, and other officials, the right to ask for an advisory opinion from the House Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards.

* Title 15, Chapter 22, which deals with federal trademark law, does not allow anyone to trademark of the portrait of a deceased U.S. president as long as his widow survives, unless the former first lady gives permission.

On the other hand, our spot check identified three laws that limited the rights of married people. For example, when considering eligibility for free or reduced-price school lunches, the government must, under Title 42, Chapter 13, consider the income of the spouse, if there is one.

And six statutes, even if they mentioned marriage or spouses, didn’t seem to deny rights or benefits. Some examples:

* A section under Title 42, Chapter 7, which outlines that an abstinence education program should teach, among other things, that ""abstinence from sexual activity outside marriage [is] . . . the expected standard for all school age children.""

* The section under the immigration section of Title 8, which allows immigration officers to record whether a U.S. resident is married or single when they leave the United States via the border with Canada or Mexico. The provision also allows for the recording of whether the person can read or write, their occupation and other facts.

Next, we turned to the third document supplied by Fischer: a listing prepared by Karen Loewy, a senior staff attorney at GLAD, Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders, citing 669 provisions in Rhode Island law and court rules.

Here again, the list was compiled by searching for key words; in this case, the phrase ""next of kin"" and 16 marriage-related words. This time we randomly selected 10 items to check and applied the same standard.

Five appeared to offer no special benefits to married couples. One law says there is no right of patient confidentiality in suspected cases of child abuse or neglect. A second requires the state registrar of vital records to send copies of marriage certificates to municipal clerks before the 10th day of the month.

A third outlines how people can recover money from claims made in probate proceedings, and a fourth prohibits the sale, foreclosure or transfer of property in divorce proceedings without court approval if a child is receiving public assistance.

The fifth law wasn't even a law at all. It had been repealed. It was included in the list because it had the word ""divorce"" in the original title.

So out of the 45 federal and state laws we examined, 31 clearly offer a benefit for someone who is married. But under 3 other laws, a married person may actually face a disadvantage. And in the remaining 11 cases, it doesn't appear that the distinction affects people's rights at all, a fact the GAO itself acknowledged when listing federal statutes.

When we informed Fischer about what we were finding, he referred us to Loewy, who said: ""In every one of these statutes there's an equal protection violation.""

For example, the federal abstinence eduction program that talks only about traditional married couples could be jarring to the children of same-sex couples, she said. The fact that immigration officials aren't recognizing same-sex couples on a form (as they would traditional married couples) constitutes a difference in treatment.

In fact, Loewy said, the laws that impose restrictions on the spouses in a traditional marriage also reflect a denial of rights to same-sex couples.

We disagree. To assert that any law referring to ""marriage"" or ""spouse"" or ""divorce"" or a comparable term marks a point of discrimination and, as a result, warrants inclusion on the list strikes us as a stretch.

If gay marriage proponents simply stated that marriage-related terms appear in 1,700 (or even 1,807) sections of state and federal law, there wouldn't be any debate. Instead, they cite each reference to marriage, spouse or a similar term as an example of a right denied to a gay couple.

Fischer, in his defense, points out that he spoke of ""about 1,700 rights,"" leaving him some wiggle room, since we checked only a fraction of the statutes. But because we could validate only 31 of the 45 items we did check, that suggests the number of lost rights could be significantly less than 1,700.

Clearly, couples in a traditional marriage have benefits -- both significant and obscure -- that same-sex couples in a civil union or other arrangement do not. And even our spot-check of 45 statutes confirmed that in the majority of laws we checked.

But when numbers like these are thrown around, we expect advocates to have more to back them up than a rudimentary word search that fails to say what right or benefit might be at stake.

The assertion that federal law denies gay couples 1,100 federal and 600 state rights has not been proven because the technique used to reach the claim produced an unreliable total",True,"April 17, 2011"
Says the majority of Americans support gay marriage.,"
Actor Anne Hathaway and other Hollywood celebrities recently wrote to President Barack Obama urging him to support gay marriage. The letter said a majority of Americans now support it.

Indeed, public opinion on gay marriage is shifting quickly. How quickly? Let's just say we're glad we waited a day to publish our item.

The letter came on the heels of the White House announcement that it would no longer defend the Defense of Marriage Act in court. The act defines marriage as a legal union between one man and one woman. The letter, sponsored by Freedom to Marry, a group that advocates for marriage for same-sex couples, called the DOMA decision ""a powerful statement about the law"" and an ""important step toward equal protection under the law for all Americans.""

The letter urged the president ""to complete your journey and join us, and the majority of Americans, who support the freedom to marry.""

It was signed by a group of actors, musicians, business executives and pro athletes including entertainers Ellen DeGeneres and Martin Sheen; musicians Rufus Wainwright and Melissa Etheridge; and football players Scott Fujita and Brendon Ayanbadejo.

Obama's position to date has been support for ""strong civil unions,"" but he allowed in December that, ""my feelings are constantly evolving,"" and that he will ""continue to wrestle"" with the issue.

The American public has long been deeply divided over the question of same-sex marriage, and so we wondered if the letter is accurate that a majority of Americans now support it.

Jackie Yodashkin, a spokeswoman for Freedom to Marry, backed up the claim by pointing us toward two polls.

The first was a poll conducted by the Associated Press in August 2010 that asked the question, ""Should the Federal Government give legal recognition to marriages between couples of the same sex, or not?""  It was supported by 52 percent and opposed by 46 percent. The percentages were nearly the reverse in a poll the year before.

The second was a CNN poll, also in August 2010, in which 52 percent responded ""yes"" to the question, ""Do you think gays and lesbians should have a constitutional right to get married and have their marriage recognized by law as valid?"" But the results differed slightly depending how the question was asked. Half got a question that read ""should have"" right to marry and the other half was asked if gay people ""have"" a right to marry. The ""should"" version produced a 52-46 majority in favor of gay marriage, while the ""have a right"" question produced a 49-51 majority against.

Charles Franklin, co-founder of Pollster.com and professor of political science at University of Wisconsin at Madison, said the results show people understand ""it isn't a settled constitutional right, though a majority think it should be one.""

Other polls show growing support for gay marriage, but less than a majority.

For example, a Pew Research Center poll released on March 3, 2011, found that while the clear trend is heading in favor of gay marriage, the American public remains about equally divided.

According to a Pew news release on its study, ""The new poll finds that about as many adults now favor (45 percent) as oppose (46 percent) allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally. Last year opponents outnumbered supporters 48 percent to 42 percent. Opposition to same-sex marriage has declined by 19 percentage points since 1996, when 65 percent opposed gay marriage and only 27 percent were in favor.""

A review of the totality of recent polls suggests that, ""opinion has moved, but it is not a majority sentiment yet,"" said Karlyn Bowman, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.

""I'd rate it 'not true yet,'"" Franklin said. ""There are some individual polls that have shown support larger than opposition but the overall trend isn't quite there yet.""

But it's likely to be true soon, he said.

""The consistency of the trends since 2005 all but guarantee support will exceed opposition within the year,"" said Franklin, who wrote about the trend in a recent Huffington Post story.

Then, on March 18, 2011, a Washington Post-ABC News poll found that a slim majority now supports gay marriage.

According to the Post story about it, ""The results underscore the nation’s increasingly tolerant views about homosexuals, and parallel a string of recent legal and legislative victories for gay rights advocates.""

""Five years ago, at 36 percent, support for gay marriage barely topped a third of all Americans,"" the story states. ""Now, 53 percent say gay marriage should be legal, marking the first time in Post-ABC polling that a majority has said so.""

The story notes that opponents of same-sex marriage took issue with the wording in the poll: ""Do you think it should be legal or illegal for gay and lesbian couples to get married?""

According to the story, ""Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, argued that the term 'illegal' could be inferred to mean that violators could be imprisoned, which most Americans would consider harsh."" It is the same language used in Post-ABC News polls since 2003.

""The only poll that counts is a free and fair vote on the part of the people,"" Brown told the Washington Post. ""We’ve seen these biased polls time and time again -- right before votes in which same-sex marriage is rejected. It’s absurd. The people of this country have not changed their opinion about marriage.""

A couple of other caveats.

When the option of civil unions (short of marriage) is added to the mix, the numbers change. In several recent polls that asked which of three options best describes their preference -- legalizing same-sex marriage, civil unions or none -- the top-rated option was legalizing marriage, with about 37 to 40 percent support.

""I would not rate that as evidence of majority support for gay marriage, though it is an interesting change from the early 2000s when no legal recognition was the largest category,"" Franklin said.

One other factor to consider: Public opinion sometimes shifts when the issue of gay marriage really heats up.

""We saw movement away from gay marriage in 2004-05, showing that despite the long-term trend there is a possibility of reaction against expansion of gay marriage when the issue is made especially salient,"" Franklin said.  ""But that said, it is hard to imagine the lines don't cross in the next 12 months or so, given how much the gap closed in each of the last five years.""

Bottom line, most of the polls taken in 2010 and 2011 show that while there is a clear trend in recent years toward support for gay marriage, but it is not quite yet a majority. But there are some polls that have found the tipping point has been reached, and that a slim majority now support gay marriage. And that includes the newest poll, from the Washington Post-ABC News",Mostly True,"March 18, 2011"
"A 2005 gay pride vote ""had nothing to do with discrimination.""","
With two seemingly divergent votes on gay rights, Tampa mayoral candidate Tom Scott is facing heat from both liberals and conservatives.

Gay rights groups lambaste Scott for his 2005 vote as a Hillsborough County commissioner to ban the county from acknowledging or promoting gay pride events. Conservative groups condemn the city councilman for voting in 2009 to add transgender protection to Tampa’s human rights ordinance.

Asked about the apparent contradiction during the St. Petersburg Times-Bay News 9 debate on Feb. 8, 2011, Scott said the 2005 vote ""had nothing to do with discrimination. I oppose any kind of discrimination in any form.""

We asked him again on Feb. 11 about the vote. ""The issue was spending public dollars to advocate or advertise gay pride,"" he said.

Scott is trying to make a distinction between issues like housing or employment discrimination and support for gay pride events. He highlights his recent vote and says he wants to be a mayor who represents everyone.

We wanted to dig deeper into Hillborough's policy. Does it have anything to do with discrimination?

It began in 2005 when then-County Commissioner Ronda Storms saw a display at a county library promoting Gay Pride month. Storms, who is now a state senator, worried about passing the display with her kids and having to explain it to them.

On June 15, 2005, Storms made the following motion at a county commission meeting: ""I move that we adopt a policy that Hillsborough County government abstain from acknowledging, promoting or participating in gay pride recognition and events, little g, little p.""

Scott seconded the motion. It passed 5-1. Storms followed up with a second proposal that the policy can only be rescinded with a super-majority vote and a public hearing.

The lone 'no' vote came from Kathy Castor, now a Democratic congresswoman. During the brief discussion of the proposal, she said, ""I think it's inappropriate for government to promote discrimination.""

We asked Nadine Smith, director of the gay rights group Equality Florida, if she thought the policy has anything to do with discrimination.

""The vote in 2005 was simple, mean-spirited bigotry,"" she said. ""It was indefensible.""

She added: ""Were he to ask for my advice, I would tell him you should just apologize for what they did. Say, 'What we did was wrong. We singled out one class of citizens to be treated differently.'""

County Attorney Renee Lee interprets the policy as banning county funds from going to gay pride events. Participation as a board is also prohibited, though individual commissioners can do as they like. The policy also means the board cannot acknowledge a gay pride event with a resolution or proclamation.

""We have not had any recent instances where the board has had to invoke the use of that policy,"" Lee said.

Lee deferred to Scott when asked if the policy was discriminatory.

Hillsborough's refusal to support gay pride events is not legal discrimination. Federal and state laws prohibit unfair treatment in housing, employment and public accommodations based on a person's race, national origin, religion, gender, disability, age or martial status.

Neither federal nor Florida anti-discrimination laws include a sexual orientation provision.

The gay pride policy was challenged in federal court by strip club owner Joe Redner. The two sides settled in 2007, agreeing to update the policy so it shall not ""be construed to prevent citizens from exercising their First Amendment rights in an appropriate forum.""

So the policy is unquestionably legal. But does it involve discrimination?

Let's check out a few definitions:

The Florida Commission on Human Relations: ""The unfair treatment of a person or group on the basis of prejudice and without regard to individual merit.""

Webster's New World Dictionary: ""A showing of partiality or prejudice in treatment; specifically action or policies directed against the welfare of minority groups.""

The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says discrimination involves treating someone ""unfavorably"" because they are a member of a protected class of people. (Once again, federal law doesn't include gay people as a protected class.)

Basically, it's differential treatment of a person or group — not based on merit but because the person belongs to that group.

Hillsborough County issues scores of resolutions each year lauding groups and community leaders. It also supports several so-called ""pride"" events each year. A 2006 county newsletter reads in part, ""Every year, Hillsborough County helps recognize Hispanic Heritage month…"" The county is also listed as the top partner of the upcoming Asia Fest 2011.

The county in 2007 issued a proclamation honoring the bicentennial birthday of Confederate commander Robert E. Lee. But the 2005 policy precludes the county from issuing a similar commendation of a gay pride event.

""The difference would be you're talking about a race or culture versus a sexual orientation,"" Scott said. He noted the county doesn't promote heterosexual pride events.

Added Tampa family values activist David Caton: ""Being Hispanic is not a changeable position. There are, however, people who have left the homosexual lifestyle. There’s a huge difference in recognizing a group of people based upon their lifestyle.""

Whether homosexuality is a lifestyle choice is, itself, also a topic of continuing debate. In an online fact sheet, the American Psychological Association says, ""no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation is determined by any particular factor or factors. Many think that nature and nurture both play complex roles; most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation.""

We understand gay rights is a tough political issue. It touches on religious and cultural beliefs that run the gamut from liberal to conservative to somewhere in between. Reasonable people have legitimate disagreements on the topic.

Regarding the 2005 vote, many parents were uncomfortable with a gay-themed book display in a public library. Many people think the vote is good public policy. According to federal and state laws, the policy is not discrimination.

But Scott is wrong in casting the 2005 issue as being just about ""spending public dollars"" and ""had nothing to do with discrimination."" The county won't even recognize gay pride with a resolution or proclamation as it does for other groups. The policy does involve discrimination. A group of people is treated differently. They aren't treated differently because of individual merit. They're treated differently because they belong to that group",False,"February 21, 2011"
"""Between Austin, San Antonio, Houston and Dallas over 8,000 same-sex couples are raising children.""","
A Texas group promoting plans by gay couples to seek marriage licenses on Valentine’s Day issued a Feb. 9 press release suggesting it speaks for many urban parents. ""Between Austin, San Antonio, Houston and Dallas over 8,000 same-sex couples are raising children,"" said Michael Diviesti, state coordinator of GetEQUAL TX, part of a self-described national lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender civil rights group advocating legal and social equality.

Says who?

In response to our query, Diviesti told us most of his parental count was drawn from reported research by Gary Gates, a scholar at the University of California-Los Angeles. He pointed us to a Jan. 25 article on Gates’ work in the Dallas Voice, a gay-oriented newspaper, featuring a chart stating there are 3,178 gay couples raising children in Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, 2,458 in Houston-Sugarland-Baytown and 1,180 in San Antonio-New Braunfels, accounting for 6,816 couples in those metropolitan statisical areas. The chart doesn’t specify what year it covers nor the number of gay couples raising children in the Austin area.

The article says the study was highlighted in a New York Times news article. That story, published Jan. 18, quotes Gates saying that survey data gathered by the U.S. Census Bureau indicates there were about 581,000 same-sex couples in the United States in 2009.

The Times’ story says Gates has concluded that child rearing among same-sex couples is more common in the South than in any other region of the country and that gay couples in states such as Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas are more likely to be raising children than their counterparts on the West Coast, in New York and in New England.

One factor, the story says, is that a large number of gay couples, possibly a majority, previously had children with partners in heterosexual relationships.

Some 34 percent of same-sex couples in San Antonio are raising children, Gates is quoted saying, placing the city No. 1 nationally.

Separately, Diviesti also noted a January 2008 online post by the Williams Institute, a UCLA School of Law think tank that says it advances sexual orientation law and public policy through independent research. The post states that according to census data, some 20 percent--or 10,000--of almost 50,000 same-sex couples in Texas were raising children as of 2005. The same year, the post says, an estimated 17,444 of Texas’s children were living in households headed by same-sex couples.

In response to our inquiry about how many gay couples are raising children in Austin, Diviesti said that in compiling numbers for the press release, he mistakenly used a 2000 census figure for same-sex couples in Travis County--2,984--for his Austin number.""I was in a rush to find the statistic,"" Diviesti said. He said his error probably makes his figure of more than 8,000 about 1,000 too high.

Next, we contacted Gates, who said the information in the Times’ story came from his analysis of annual census survey numbers. Gates added via e-mail: ""These are not statistics that the Census Bureau provides on its public website. Instead, they are my own analyses of Public Use Microdata Samples that are made available each year. The analyses combine data from 2005-2009 in order to get sufficient samples sizes of the same-sex couples.""

Gates told us his latest review suggests there are 945 same-sex couples raising children in the Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos metropolitan statistical area. We added that to his reported estimates of same-sex couples raising children in the three other Texas areas, and got 7,761.

We asked Gates if he did, or could, narrow his area-wide estimates to the cities singled out by the Texas group. He said he did not and that it would be difficult to do so. One factor that complicates the calculation: ""There likely is a meaningful difference as I believe that city residents (generally and among same-sex couples) are less likely to be raising children than suburban couples.""

All told, it appears that 7,761 same-sex couples--not more than 8,000--are raising children in metropolitan statistical areas that include Austin, San Antonio, Houston and Dallas. That total is even lower if referencing the cities alone, as the statement does, though by how much is hard to say",Half True,"February 14, 2011"
"""Massachusetts public schools teach kids as young as kindergartners about gay marriage.""","
In early January, just days after Lincoln Chafee replaced Donald Carcieri as governor of Rhode Island, advocates on both sides of the same-sex marriage debate ramped up their annual battle.

This year, the fight is taking on new intensity because, while Carcieri vowed for eight years to veto any bill to legalize gay marriage, Chafee supports it.

Recently, a leading opponent, the National Organization for Marriage, mailed brochures throughout the state that included the headline: ""Imposing same-sex marriage has consequences."" The brochure listed four ""real consequences"" of ""redefining marriage to a genderless institution.""

We chose to examine one of the claims: ""Massachusetts’ public schools teach kids as young as kindergartners about gay marriage. Parents have no legal right to object!""

We contacted Christopher C. Plante, executive director of the Rhode Island chapter of NOM, who told us that many schools in Massachusetts -- where same-sex marriage has been legal since 2004 -- have books on the subject in their libraries.The ""poster child,"" he said, is a picture book called  ""King & King,""  by Linda de Haan and Stern Nijland.

The book tells the story of a queen who decided it was time for her son, the prince, to marry. He rejects every princess she offers. Finally the last candidate enters, and the prince feels ""a stir in his heart."" But it was for the princess’s brother, Prince Lee.

The two marry, and the book says ""everyone lives happily ever after."" On the last page, the two princes kiss, with a red heart covering their mouths.

The book ""glorifies the idea that it’s perfectly OK to have same-sex marriage,"" said Plante. And he said the courts have ruled that the educational system has a duty to ""normalize"" same-sex marriage for grades as low as kindergarten.

Asked for examples of where the book is taught to kindergartners, Plante offered just one location, Lexington, Mass., where it became an issue in 2006.  

That year, two couples -- David and Tonia Parker and Robert and Robin Wirthlin -- filed a federal lawsuit against Lexington school officials. The suit alleged that the Parkers’ son was given a book in kindergarten that depicts various forms of families, including one with parents of the same gender. And, the suit said, when the Wirthlins’ son was in first grade, he was read another book,  ""King & King,"" in school.

The parents said they have religious beliefs that homosexuality is immoral and that marriage is  a holy union only of a man and a woman. They alleged school officials were attempting to indoctrinate their children with the belief that same sex marriages are moral.

In 2007, The U.S. District Court in Massachusetts dismissed the parents’ claims, finding that parents don’t have the right to restrict what a public school may teach their children, even if the teachings contradict the parents’ religious beliefs.

The parents appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit but lost. The appeals court wrote: ""There is no allegation here of a formalized curriculum requiring students to read many books affirming gay marriage. The reading by a teacher of one book, or even three, and even if to a young and impressionable child, does not constitute ""indoctrination.""

Asked for any other examples of gay marriage being taught to kindergartners, Plante referred us to Kris Mineau, executive director of the Massachusetts Family Institute, which describes itself as ""dedicated to strengthening the family and affirming the Judeo-Christian values upon which it is based.""

Mineau said he has been fighting same-sex marriage advocates for eight years and he is certain their message is being spread in schools throughout Massachusetts.

But he acknowledged he could not cite any examples other than Lexington. ""I don’t have documentation of everything going on,"" Mineau said. ""It’s very difficult to quantify.""

Mineau also said the 2007 court rulings discouraged other parents from officially complaining about their children being exposed to school programs endorsing same-sex marriage.

We looked for other evidence that Massachusetts schools are teaching kindergartners about same-sex marriage.

We asked Jonathan Considine, spokesman for the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, if the state mandated curriculum on same-sex marriage for kindergartners. The answer is no, he said. Massachusetts is a local control state, so each district decides on what topics to cover.

He said, ""Massachusetts does not require that students in any grade be taught about gay marriage.""

He said many schools have used books or promoted discussions to teach tolerance because some students have same-sex parents and there are teachers with same-sex spouses.

Considine referred us to The Massachusetts Comprehensive Health Curriculum, which includes a standard that by fifth grade, students should be able to define sexual orientation, such as heterosexual, gay and lesbian. It makes no recommendations about teaching different types of marriages to kindergartners.

Then we called the Massachusetts Teachers Association, which represents 107,000 educators.

Laura Bennett, a spokeswoman for the association, said she does not know whether anyone is discussing same-sex marriages with kindergartners in any of the state’s hundreds of school districts.  But she is relatively certain no one else has publicly complained.

""I work on communications with teachers, and if there were other cases, I would have heard,"" she said. ""There’s just that one case, over and over again.""

""I haven’t heard boo about this,"" added Thomas Gosnell, president of the American Federation of Teachers Massachusetts, which represents most of the other educators in the state. ""I have not heard one of my members tell me they are talking about gay marriage in kindergarten. They are probably not talking about any kind of marriage in that grade.

""I don’t even hear anyone talking about gay marriage anymore,"" he added. ""It’s just there.""

Bottom line: The National Organization for Marriage mailing says that Massachusetts public schools teach kindergartners about gay marriage. The wording, including the present tense verb, gives the impression this is happening now, in many schools.

But the group’s only evidence is two incidents five years ago. It’s possible that somewhere, in one of the 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts, other kindergartners have been taught about same-sex marriage. But NOM couldn’t cite any other examples",False,"February 10, 2011"
"""Over 80 percent of the people want the shot to vote"" on whether to approve same-sex marriage, according to polls.","
The question of whether same-sex marriage should be legal in Rhode Island could be answered in the coming year. There's growing support in the General Assembly to passing it and Governor-elect Lincoln Chafee has vowed to support it.

One group opposed to gay marriage, the National Organization for Marriage -- Rhode Island (NOM-RI), however, has been advocating for a binding referendum on the matter instead of a legislative vote, arguing that polls prove the people want the right to make the decision.

Talk-radio host and former Providence Mayor Vincent A. ""Buddy"" Cianci repeatedly cited the 80-percent figure during the Dec. 12, 2010, ""6 News On The Record"" program on WLNE-TV.

""One of the things I do know from seeing polls that I see every day is that over 80 percent of the people want the shot to vote for it,"" he said.

""The polls that I've seen show that 80 percent of Rhode Islanders want the opportunity to vote,"" he said at another point in the program. ""I'm not saying that they're against gay marriage or same-sex marriage, but they say they want the opportunity to vote on it.""

We were curious about whether public sentiment was that strong against having the legislature and the governor decide the question.

It turns out that the polls in question were commissioned by NOM-RI, the group opposing same-sex marriage. Christopher C. Plante, the group's executive director, said there were three surveys done by Quest Research, which is based in Rhode Island.

Here at PolitiFact, we know that opinion polls can be tricky things. The answers you get often depend on the precise wording of the question and, in some cases, the questions or comments leading up to the question.

""When any interest group puts forward a poll, one has to be careful in judging the results because the question's wording may reflect the axe they want to grind,"" said John Geer, professor of political science at Vanderbilt University and author of ""From Tea Leaves to Opinion Polls.""

So we wanted to see the full poll questions and responses. We found a report on a June 2009 poll on the NOM-RI website. Plante sent us the questions and answers from of the group's December 2009 survey. The group also did a poll in August 2010, but Plante declined to release those results. However, one question from that 2010 survey does appear on a NOM-RI web page. All three polls surveyed about 400 people and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percent.

The question that directly addressed the issue was asked in both 2009 polls. It mentions that some people want to legalize gay marriage and asks whether this issue ""should be decided by a vote of the Legislature or should it be decided by voters in a statewide election?"" In June of that year, 74 percent said it should be the people. By December that percentage had jumped to 80.

The rate of support was even higher -- 82 percent in June and 84 percent in December -- when the question was worded this way: ""Voters in thirty states in America have had the opportunity to decide whether gay marriage would be legalized in their state. Do you think Rhode Island voters should also have an opportunity to vote on this issue?""

The two independent polling experts we consulted said the reference to those 30 other states made this a loaded question because it encourages Rhode Islanders to follow the trend.

""That's totally loading it. That's a classic example of generating a higher number,"" Geer said.

The phrasing added 10 percentage points to the let-the-people-decide category when the question was asked in the June survey; 2 points in December.

The only question released by NOM-RI in its August 2010 poll, which also shows strong support for letting the people decide, asked likely voters whether they agreed or disagreed with this statement: ""The people of Rhode Island themselves should decide the question of marriage, not judges or backroom politicians.""

The reference to ""backroom politicians"" (as opposed to ""frontroom politicians""?) ""is clearly a negative cue in the question. That's clearly designed to elicit a particular response,"" said James Henson, co-director, University of Texas / Texas Tribune Poll.

For that question, 77 percent ""strongly"" or ""somewhat"" agreed.

""I suspect the 'backroom politician' phrase is getting the 'strongly agree' to go up quite substantially,"" said Geer.

Although NOM-RI cites Quest as the polling organization, Victor Profughi of Quest said he did not design the questions in all the polls, particularly the survey that used the ""backroom politicians"" phrase.

""The last questionnaire I didn't even see until we went into the field,"" he  said. ""My agreement with them was to draw the sample, make sure the survey itself was professionally undertaken and then I wrote a report based on the data, which I gave to them.""

Despite some biased questions, the two independent pollsters we consulted said the 80 percent figure is probably close to the truth, judging from the responses when the query was unbiased query. (We also asked Cianci to weigh in on this, but he didn't respond to our e-mail.)

""The numbers are overwhelming that the public wants to make that choice,"" said Geer. ""Questionable wording can bias a poll when people don't have a lot of information and don't have any strong set of prior opinions about a topic.""

Because a lot of people have a strong opinions on gay marriage, ""you probably can't move the numbers very much,"" he said.

But there's another phenomenon at work here, Geer and Henson said.

When asked, voters ALWAYS want to be the ones to decide hot-button issues.

""Of course they're going to say yes,"" said Geer. ""If you ask parents whether they or teachers should make decisions about their child, of course everybody's going to say themselves. So the numbers [in the NOM-RI poll] are hardly surprising.""

What's more revealing is how voters answered some of the other questions in the two 2009 surveys that NOM-RI made available.

From June to December, support for same-sex marriage seemed to rise significantly, going from 36 percent in June to 43 percent in December.

That December, only 32 percent said they opposed gay marriage, yet 44 percent expressed support for an anti-gay marriage proposal declaring that ""Only marriage between a man and a woman will be valid or recognized in Rhode Island.""

Again, it's all about how you word the question.

""If you ask people across the country, 'Do you think marriage should be an institution between a man and a woman,' you'd probably get 75 percent of the people saying yes. But if you say, 'Should we deny gay couples the opportunities afforded other couples,' then all of a sudden there's a lot more support for gay rights,"" said Geer.

In the end, none of the questions we saw directly ask Rhode Islanders whether they want the General Assembly to stay out of the same-sex marriage issue.

But it appears that, when the question is posed in a neutral way, a hefty majority wants voters to determine the issue.

Cianci didn't mention that support for a referendum on same-sex marriage fell below 80 percent in some polls. Nor did he mention that the polling was being done by a special interest group. And we believe the former mayor -- who eats, drinks and breathes politics, and currently serves as a political consultant for Channel 6 -- knows loaded questions when he sees them.

Those are important elements for people to know. Yet Cianci simply kept repeating the 80 percent figure as it were a consistent, reliable number",Mostly True,"December 26, 2010"
"Says that ""all those who do not answer directly to the president, they've said (repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell) is a terrible idea.""","
Objecting to a proposal repealing the law preventing gays and lesbians from serving openly in the U.S. military, U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Tyler, said he had received hundreds of letters from military personnel vowing not to re-enlist if the change went through.

""The hundreds I've heard from, that I didn't bring their quotes down here, have said, you pass this and I will tell you personally, but I will not say it in the presence of my commander, you pass this, I will not re-enlist,"" Gohmert said on the House floor Dec. 15. ""...Because we know what this president, this commander in chief, wants, just as does the secretary of defense, the two people that the president appoints said let's do it, because they know the president appointed, he's their boss, and all those who do not answer directly to the president, they've said this is a terrible idea.""

The House subsequently voted to repeal the ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" law and the Senate followed suit. President Barack Obama signed the change into law Wednesday.

Regardless, was Gohmert correct that the two people the president appointed supported the change in law, but that everyone who doesn't answer to Obama gave the idea thumbs-downs?

To our request for back-up evidence, Gohmert sent this statement: ""The top officers in the Air Force, Army and Marine Corps have voiced grave concerns with ending the DADT policy during a time of war. Any disruption to our military at a time when our troops are in harm’s way is dangerous and could cost lives. One single life lost to a degradation of combat-unit cohesion on the front lines is one life too many.""

That sent us scrambling for testimony.

To recap: On Feb. 2, Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, each told the Senate Armed Services Committee he favored dropping the Don't Ask, Don't Tell law put in place in 1993.

Mullen testified: ""No matter how I look at the issue, I cannot escape being troubled by the fact that we have in place a policy which forces young men and women to lie about who they are in order to defend their fellow citizens.""

According to a Feb. 2 New York Times news article, Mullen was the first sitting chairman of the Joint Chiefs to support repealing the law, saying it was his belief that ""allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly would be the right thing to do."" According to the Times, Gates ""was more cautious, even as he acknowledged that the question was not whether the law would be repealed, but how the Pentagon might best prepare for the change.""

Next, we turned to news articles on testimony about the change posted online by the American Forces Press Service.

On Dec. 3, the joint chiefs testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee; Gen. James Cartwright, vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said he favored repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell.

Adm. Gary Roughhead, chief of naval operations, is quoted saying: ""With the exception of the moderate risk associated with projected retention and some Navy irregular warfare specialties, I assess the risk of readiness, effectiveness and cohesion to the Navy to be low. Based on my professional judgment and informed by the inputs of our Navy, I recommend repeal.""

Gen. George Casey Jr., the Army chief of staff, is quoted saying he supports repealing the law, but not during wartime. Gen. Norton Schwartz, the Air Force chief of staff, and Gen. James Amos, the Marine Corps' top officer, also recommended not repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell while the United States is at war.

Scorecard?

The defense secretary, chairman and vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff testified in favor of repealing the law. So too did the Navy's Roughhead.

However, three of the four joint chiefs — the top officers Gohmert refered to in his statement to us — recommended not repealing the law now.

According to federal law, members of the joint chiefs of staff are military advisers to the president, with the chairman — Mullen — being the primary adviser. The chairman is appointed by the president, with advice and consent from the Senate.

Next, we turned to the results of a nine-month Pentagon study on the effects of repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell. According to the results, released Nov. 30, the study amounted to one of the largest in the military's history, drawing 115,052 responses to a survey issued to nearly 40,000 active-duty and reserve service members.

From the study: ""When we asked about how having a service member in their immediate unit who said he or she is gay would affect the unit's ability to 'work together to get the job done,' 70 percent of service members predicted it would have a positive, mixed or no effect... when asked about the actual experience of serving in a unit with a coworker who they believed was gay or lesbian, 92 percent stated that the unit's 'ability to work together' was 'very good,' 'good,' or 'neither good nor poor.'""

According to the study, 15 to 20 percent of service members said repeal would have a positive effect, while 30 percent said it would have a negative effect.

So, some—not all—military personnel objected to repealing the law, some saying the timing is bad. And not all who don’t answer directly to the president labeled the change a terrible idea",False,"December 23, 2010"
"""The senior senator from Arizona (John McCain) said he couldn't support repealing 'don't ask, don't tell' because of the economy.""","
In an address from the floor of the Senate on Dec. 4, 2010, Democratic Sen. Harry Reid used the analogy of Lucy from the Peanuts cartoon -- who repeatedly pulled the football away every time Charlie Brown went to kick it -- to describe Sen. John McCain's reasoning for his opposition to abolishing the military's controversial ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy.

""First, Sen. McCain said he would seriously consider repealing it if the military leadership thought we should, and (when) the military leadership said it should be repealed, he pulled away the football. Then Sen. McCain said he would need to see a study from the Pentagon. When the Pentagon produced the study saying repeal would have no negative effect at all, he pulled away the football again,"" Reid said.

""And his latest trick, he said yesterday that he opposed repealing 'don't ask, don't tell,' a proposal that would be a great stride forward for both equality and military readiness ... because of the economy,"" said Reid, whose quote was picked up in Politico. ""I repeat, the senior senator from Arizona said he couldn't support repealing 'don't ask, don't tell' because of the economy.""

""I have no idea what he's talking about, and no one else does either,"" Reid said.

Reid's statement -- based on comments McCain made the day before during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the Defense Department's report about the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy -- seemed to suggest that McCain believed ""don't ask, don't tell"" had some sort of negative economic consequences.

But that's not the context for McCain's comments. Rather, it was an issue of legislative priority. McCain's point was that the issue of how to address a flailing economy ought to be addressed before the Senate considered something like ""don't ask, don't tell.""

""I will not agree to have this bill go forward ... because our economy is in the tank,"" McCain said. ""Our economy is in the tank, and the American people want that issue addressed. And the military is functioning in the most efficient, most professional, most courageous fashion than at any time in our history.

""So to somehow believe that this is some kind of compelling issue at a time we're in two wars ... is obviously not something that we should be exercising a rush to judgment.""

Two days earlier the entire Republican caucus in the Senate signed a letter, sent to Reid, promising to filibuster any bills proposed by Democrats until the Senate had acted to prevent the expiration of the Bush tax cuts for all taxpayers. Republicans have argued that letting the tax cuts expire even for the wealthy, as Democrats proposed, would deal a devastating blow to the economy.

McCain's comments about not taking up ""don't ask don't tell"" in light of the economy are consistent with that Republican pledge.

McCain added that he would be willing to consider the ""don't ask, don't tell"" issue in depth during the next legislative session.

""I would be more than eager in the coming year to have additional hearings, as they had some 13 hearings when 'don't, ask, don't tell' was enacted,"" McCain said. ""And I would pledge to work with you on that effort, but certainly not during a lame-duck session when parts of my state are suffering in ways that they never have in the history of my state.""

It's true that McCain listed the poor economy as a reason he would not support ""don't ask, don't tell,"" but only in the context of the economy needing to be a higher priority for the Senate. When Reid claimed, ""the senior senator from Arizona said he couldn't support repealing 'don't ask, don't tell' because of the economy,"" the implication seems to be that McCain was making an argument that ""don't ask, don't tell"" would harm the economy. Especially when Reid added, ""I have no idea what he's talking about, and no one else does either."" The policy's impact on the economy would be a confusing argument. But in context, McCain's reference to the economy was quite clearly ranking other priorities against it",Half True,"December 6, 2010"
"The Pentagon's survey about the ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy found that 92 percent of service members ""agree that they could serve ... in a unit in combat"" without compromising ""mission readiness.""","
On Dec. 5, 2010, ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour devoted much of its program to a discussion of whether, and how, to end the military's ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy and open the ranks fully to gay and lesbian service members. A portion of the discussion addressed a detailed Pentagon study of the issue released on Nov. 30.

The study, among other things, included a survey of some 115,000 active-duty and reserve members, which the report called ""one of the largest surveys in the history of the U.S. military."" Those who back the effort to open the military to openly gay and lesbian personnel hailed the survey as concrete evidence that any problems integrating gay men and women into the services will be limited and manageable. Opponents of a change, for their part, found evidence within the survey that showed a greater likelihood of problems, especially in specific groups such as combat units.

On This Week, retired Army Gen. Wesley Clark, the former top NATO commander in Europe and a former Democratic presidential candidate, cited one finding from the survey that indicated that a transition away from ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" should be achievable with relative ease.

Clark said ""what the survey showed is that essentially all of the service members, 92 percent, agree that they could serve -- they could serve in a unit in combat, and they could work together effectively, and it wouldn't compromise mission readiness.""

He continued, ""I think a lot of the survey, honestly. It shows the effects of six, eight months' politicization, continuing coverage in the media, and some of it is just people in the military saying, just leave us alone and let us do our job. They come down on one side or the other of this. Let's just get on with it.""

We wondered whether the study really showed that 92 percent of service members were comfortable serving with gay men and women, as Clark suggested. We found that Clark was off the mark in describing what that poll result meant.

Once we looked at the report, we were able to find the 92 percent statistic easily. It appears in the report summary, as one of three findings that ""best represented"" the survey as a whole. ""When asked about the actual experience of serving in a unit with a co-worker who they believed was gay or lesbian, 92 percent stated that the unit’s 'ability to work together' was 'very good,' 'good,' or 'neither good nor poor,'"" the report said.

Superficially, that sentence seems to back up Clark's comment. However, the report is worded somewhat unclearly, and it took us a couple readings before we fully understood what the 92 percent figure referred to.

In a footnote, the report sources the statement to Question 47a. But there's a problem for Clark. That question was asked only of a subset of survey respondents -- those who ""said they served with a coworker they believed to be gay or lesbian and where all, most, some or a few other unit members believed the coworker to be gay or lesbian.""

Of the roughly 115,000 service members interviewed for the survey, only about 78,500 -- or two-thirds -- fell into that category.

One can imagine that service members who have been through the experience of serving alongside a gay or lesbian colleague might feel more comfortable about the arrangement than those who have not. So using this subset to extrapolate to all service members is problematic. And when survey questions were asked of all respondents, rather than just the subset of those who think they served with someone gay, the levels of comfort are consistently lower.

In Question 68a, for instance, the survey asked, ""If 'Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell' is repealed and you are working with a service member in your immediate unit who has said he or she is gay or lesbian, how, if at all, would it affect how service members in your immediate unit work together to get the job done?""

For this question, 26 percent answered ""negatively"" or ""very negatively."" That's more than triple the 8.4 percent that answered ""poor"" or ""very poor"" when an equivalent question was asked only of those who believed they had served with a gay or lesbian colleague.

Answers were similar with other questions asked of the entire set of respondents. When asked how ""service members in your immediate unit (would) pull together to perform as a team"" after the repeal of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell,"" a little more than 29 percent of all respondents answered ""negatively"" or ""very negatively."" And when asked ""how service members in your immediate unit (would) trust each other"" after repeal, about 33 percent of all respondents answered ""negatively"" or ""very negatively.""

It's worth noting that even at these higher rates, only a minority of survey respondents said that repealing ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" would produce exclusively negative consequences. So while the level of comfort Clark cites -- 92 percent -- is too high, the survey nonetheless found a notable degree of comfort with a repeal ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" within the ranks. (Or at least a tolerance for repeal. Only about 18 percent of all respondents went so far as to say repeal would be ""very positive"" or ""positive,"" while 52 percent -- an absolute majority -- said it would either have no effect on performance or an equal mix of positive and negative effects.)

So Clark is generally right that only a small minority of service members think a repeal would have negative or very negative effects on unit performance, but he exaggerates just how small that minority is",Half True,"December 6, 2010"
"Says Republican candidates in Oregon are ""advocating violence"" against gays.","
Campaign donation requests say the darndest things. Take, for instance, a fresh-off-the-keyboard e-mail received from the Basic Rights Equality PAC -- the political finance arm of Basic Rights Oregon -- that ties the views of one pollster to those of the Senate Republicans.

First, the e-mail starts by quoting from a Willamette Week article:
  
""It’s hard to believe. But there it was in bold print in ‘Willamette Week’: an advisor to Oregon Senate Republicans ‘advocates death for gays.’ "" 
The e-mail continues, making some assertions of its own: 
""It’s shocking that candidates in Oregon would be so blatantly anti-gay -- even advocating violence."" 
Indeed, it is shocking. That’s why PolitiFact Oregon decided to check it out.

As a basis for their claim, Basic Right Oregon points to the Willamette Week article, which reported on ""an advisor to Oregon Senate Republicans"" and his alleged extreme anti-gay views. A quick Google search, and we had before us the article with the perfectly provocative headline   ""Republican Pollster In Oregon Says Slaves ‘Well-Treated’; Advocates Death for Gays.""

According to the article, state filings showed that the campaign arm of the Senate Republicans had paid thousands of dollars to Target Market Strategies for polling over the past few years. Senate Democrats pounced when they learned that Dennis Oliver Woods, the ""company principal"" of Target Market Strategies, had published a book that included the following passages: 
""Some crimes are such a violent assault on the image of God in man or on biblical society that God stipulates that nothing less than death will satisfy His offended sense of justice."" 
And then this one: 
""In addition to murder (see Lev. 24:17), the death penalty is specified for a number of crimes. This is the ultimate form of restitution. These crimes include promotion of witchcraft…Bestiality (see Lev. 20:15), homosexuality (see Lev. 20:13), incest and adultery ..."" 
We decided to give Woods a call directly to discuss his views. He wouldn’t chat with us but instead sent us an e-mail that didn’t do much to address what he actually thought. ""My point of view is really irrelevant now since the Senate Republican caucus has dismissed me and I am no longer working for them,"" he wrote.

PolitiFact Oregon wrote him back, asking for clarification. He never responded.

To learn more, we got our hands on a copy of his book, ""Discipling the Nations,"" from which all this was excerpted.

The book says that ""Part III,"" the section excerpted in Willamette Week, ""offers God’s Blueprint for Civil Government. Chapter 7 holds forth the Word of God as the only adequate rule for civil government.""

Michael Gay, the spokesman for the Senate Republicans, says they did not know about Woods’ book, which was published more than 10 years ago and is not widely distributed. They have since stopped using his services.

""He served no advisory function to the caucus whatsoever,"" Gay said. ""He was merely a vendor who made phone calls.

""We wrote the poll questions, we told him what to ask, he was scripted.""

Maya Blackmun, a spokeswoman for Basic Rights Oregon, argues, ""(I)t's common knowledge that on political campaigns pollsters are a key player in advising and consulting on a campaign, interpreting results, providing cross tab analysis, targeting profiles, connecting messages with key audiences, etc.""

Even if Woods does believe in the death penalty for gays and even if he was an adviser to the Senate Republicans, Basic Rights Oregon asserted that Republican candidates are ""blatantly anti-gay -- even advocating violence.""

PolitiFact Oregon finds no evidence of this claim. Certainly, no member of the Republican Senate caucus has spoken in support of Woods’ views or said anything remotely similar.

Blackmun concedes that the e-mail could have done with a bit of editing. It would have been fairer, she said, had the e-mail read something to the effect of ""it’s shocking that an adviser to candidates in Oregon would be so blatantly anti-gay.""

Gays tilt Democratic more than 70 percent of the time in U.S. elections? We sought more information. 
Wes Benedict, a Texan serving as the national party's executive director, responded with a Web link to a Nov. 26, 2008 article on exit polling of gay voters in the 2008 elections posted by the Williams Institute, a think tank at the University of California at Los Angeles that describes itself as advancing ""sexual orientation law and public policy through rigorous, independent research and scholarship."" 
The article, published in Bay Windows, which calls itself New England's largest GLBT newspaper, says gay voters leaned heavily to Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama that November. The article says a review of more than 80,000 votes cast in 56 heavily gay precincts over 11 cities in five states and the District of Columbia found 79 percent of the voters casting ballots for Obama, 19 percent for Republican John McCain and 1.5 percent for other candidates. Separately, the article says, exit polling conducted on behalf of five TV networks and the Associated Press shows that among voters who identified as gay, lesbian or bisexual, 70 percent voted for Obama, 27 percent for McCain and 3 percent for others--results we confirmed from a 2008 online post by CNN that also suggests 53 percent of non-gay voters favored Obama, 45 percent McCain. 
The article says that in 2004, Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry drew 77 percent of the LGB vote (a result we confirmed on CNN.com) and in 2000 Democrat Al Gore carried 70 percent of the LGB vote and in 1996 Bill Clinton, the Democratic president, carried 71 percent of the LGB vote. 
Next, we reached Patrick Egan, a New York University assistant professor of politics and public policy who has studied gay voting patterns. Egan said in an e-mail that gay voters ""lean Democratic in federal elections largely because the Democratic Party has taken more pro-gay stances on a variety of gay rights issues."" He said another reason gay voters tend to be pro-Democratic is that ""gay people are more likely than the general population to be raised in liberal families. If we assume that the trait of homosexuality is more or less randomly distributed throughout the population, this means that gay people are more likely to come out,"" or declare their sexual orientation, ""in families that are more tolerant. This tolerance affects gay people's views on everything, including party affiliation."" 
Egan said he couldn't speak directly to the Libertarian Party's appeal to gay voters, but he would quibble with anyone blaming Democrats for stalled gay-favored legislation. ""The blame for why few advances for gay rights have been achieved in this Congress has to be laid squarely on the Republican Party, not the Democrats,"" Egan writes. ""Republicans have voted en masse against every proposed change in favor of gay rights, and in most cases have blocked movement on this legislation. (One way to think about this: if every Democratic member of Congress had instead been a Libertarian in this session, we still would have had the same standstill outcome.)""

So far, all the candidates say that they would follow through on a lawsuit filed by current Attorney General Bill McCollum defending the state’s gay adoption ban.

The state’s challenge comes after a Miami judge in 2008 ruled the state’s law unconstitutional, following a lawsuit by a North Miami man who wanted to adopt two foster children cared for by him and his partner.

While all the candidates have voiced their opposition to gay adoption, social conservative John Stemberger, president of the Florida Family Policy Council, is not convinced that Bondi, a former prosecutor with the State Attorney’s Office in Tampa, has established a strong enough stance in favor of the adoption ban.

On Aug. 8, 2010, Stemberger dispatched an endorsement letter supporting Kottkamp, stating that Bondi ""refuses to take a position on the gay adoption ban.""

We decided to check out Stemberger’s claim.

Going straight to the source, we asked Bondi her position on the issue and she responded with an e-mail stating: ""As Florida’s next attorney general, I will vigorously defend Florida’s law banning gay adoption in our state. As a veteran prosecutor who has spent her entire career upholding the laws of this state, I have the training and experience necessary to successfully defend our laws in a courtroom.""

Checking back on newspaper reports of earlier candidate forums and events featuring Bondi, it’s worth noting that earlier in her campaign, she was vague in outright declaring a position.

During a June 4 forum in St. Petersburg, when asked about upholding McCollum’s challenge, both Benson and Kottkamp said they would. Bondi said, ""Our judiciary will make a fair and just decision regarding that case.""

Earlier, at a May 18 appearance in Miami Lakes, Bondi was quoted by the St. Petersburg Times as mentioning two gay friends and noting that the adoption process needed reform. ""I have friends in Tampa who are in law enforcement who have adopted from overseas, who are in a loving, committed same-sex relationship."" Still, calling for an overhaul of the adoption process and clearly specifying whether or not gays should be entitled to adoption are two different things.

Bondi, a legal analyst for Fox News, began to clarify her support for the gay adoption ban in subsequent forums and newspaper interviews.

When asked by the St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald in a June 5 interview whether she would follow through on McCollum’s appeal, she responded: ""I will continue with General McCollum’s appeal. If [the Supreme Court] can legally hear it, yes, I will appeal.""

At an Aug. 7 forum sponsored by the Christian Family Coalition, Bondi pledged to oppose gay adoption.

Bondi campaign spokesman Kim Kirtley also pointed to interviews with the editorial boards of the St. Petersburg Times on July 14 and the Sun-Sentinel on Aug. 10 where she was asked about her position on gay adoption and she stated her support for the ban. Both papers have handed Bondi an endorsement. 
So back to the question. Did Bondi ""refuse to take a position on banning gay adoptions""? No. She hedged at first, but she’s made it clear since then that she will pursue the appeal and opposes gay adoption",False,"August 17, 2010"
"""Rick Scott's company is partners with Playboy in a social networking website that has community pages specifically geared towards gay dating.""","
Rick Scott's ties to a company have become, let's just say, the ""centerfold"" of a new attack being leveled by Scott's challenger for the Republican nomination for governor, Attorney General Bill McCollum.

In a new campaign mailer called ""The Two Faces of Rick Scott,"" McCollum's camp attempts to counter suggestions that Scott is a unwavering conservative with impeccable Republican credentials.

""What Rick Scott does and what Rick Scott says show the completely different faces of Rick Scott,"" says the mailer, which follows with examples.

""Rick Scott says he is an across-the-board conservative,"" the mailer says. But, ""Rick Scott's company is partners with Playboy in a social networking website that has community pages specifically geared towards gay dating.

""Rick Scott: Nothing new. Something bad.""

The mailer got us wondering -- Is Scott, a former health care CEO, in bed with Playboy?

McCollum spokeswoman Kristy Campbell said the company referenced in the mailer is Quepasa, which in Spanish means ""what's happening."" The corporation (NASDAQ: QPSA) owns Quepasa.com, which claims to be one of the world's largest Latino online communities.

The company is headquartered in West Palm Beach with offices in Miami, Los Angeles, Scottsdale, Ariz., and Hermosillo, Mexico.

As McCollum suggested, Quepasa and Playboy began partnering in 2009 to find and identify ""Cyber Chicas"" for the magazine's Mexico edition. Quepasa created an online community that features models wanting to be included in Playboy. Users of the website can go to the Playboy community to vote for and rank the women. Three finalists are forwarded each month to Playboy, which selects a winner. A 24-year-old Brazilian, Fernanda Schonardie, was selected as the first ""Cyber Chica"" and was featured in a full-page layout in the March 2009 edition of Playboy México. The partnership has continued since (We'll skip the links).

""The Playboy México community has been a tremendous success,"" Quepasa CEO, John C. Abbott, said in a press release. ""We've received numerous submissions from all over the globe and have recorded hundreds of thousands of impressions and votes from members. We are delighted with the campaign and anticipate ongoing growth in traffic.""

Quepasa reported that the Playboy México community became the most popular community on Quepasa in just a matter of weeks and represented 28 percent of all community page views.

Quepasa.com is much more than Playboy, however. It's an online network that allows people to join discussion groups about everything -- from romance, to music, to culture and politics, to sports, to religion.

The company said that as of July it had nearly 15 million online members.

Quepasa is definitely a general interest social network, and in short appears to be trying to reach anyone who would want to talk about anything. It makes sense, then, that some of the website's online communities are geared to gays and lesbians. The company also announced in June 2010 that it was partnering with online dating service Zoosk Inc. Zoosk does offer its dating services to gay people.

What is Scott's role in Quepasa? McCollum says it's his company.

But really, Scott is an investor. According to required filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Scott controls 13.8 percent of all of the stock in Quepasa, which translates to 2 million shares. We should note that Scott himself owns just a fraction of those shares. The rest are split between a family partnership and in a trust in his wife's name. Scott also has a warrant to purchase 1 million shares (A warrant is a way to entice investors into a company, by essentially offering them a good deal to accumulate large amount of shares). Scott's stock in Quepasa is worth about $7.6 million, the St. Petersburg Times reported.

Scott began investing in the company in March 2006, according to a Quepasa press release.

""Hispanic and Latino families have a growing presence in the U.S.; Quepasa has been developing content relevant to the Hispanic community for over seven years,"" Scott was quoted as saying in the release. ""Quepasa should be well positioned to build a viable company if it continues to innovate and deliver value to the Hispanic and Latino communities.""

As an investor, Scott would have some say in the company's direction, but he doesn't own enough stock to get what he wants, whenever he wants it. He does not sit on the company's board of directors, which is an important distinction considering McCollum's original statement.

In McCollum's  campaign  mailer, he said, ""Rick Scott's company is partners with Playboy in a social networking website that has community pages specifically geared towards gay dating."" The company in question, Quepasa does partner with Playboy in an Internet venture and does have community chat rooms that cater to gays and lesbians. 
But the company and the website is more than Playboy and gay dating. 
It's also misleading for McCollum to say Quepasa is Scott's company, as if he were the owner, or the one making decisions. As a fourth-largest individual stockholder, he has clout, no doubt. But he's ultimately not in charge of Quepasa. (For instance the partnership with Playboy came in 2009, three years after Scott had already invested in the company)",True,"July 19, 2010"
"During the year Kagan barred military recruiters from Harvard Law School's Office of Career Services, ""military recruiting actually went up.""","During her Supreme Court nomination hearing, Elena Kagan faced intense questioning from Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, about her decision to bar military recruiters from using the Harvard Law School's Office of Career Services during part of her tenure as the school's dean.Kagan defended her decision and repeatedly backed it up with a claim that the number of military recruits actually went up.""Senator, the military at all times during my deanship had full and good access,"" Kagan said. ""Military recruiting did not go down. Indeed, in a couple of years, including the year that you're particularly referring to, it went up. And it went up because we ensured that students would know that the military recruiters were coming to our campus. Because I talked about how important military service was. Because our veterans organization and the veterans on campus did an absolutely terrific job, a terrific service to their fellow students in talking to them about the honor of military service.""Sessions said he was ""just a little taken aback by the tone of your remarks, because it's unconnected to reality.""Kagan later said she ""always tried to make sure that I conveyed my honor for the military. And I always tried to make sure that the military had excellent access to our students. And in the short period of time, Sen. Sessions, that the military had that access through the veterans organization, military recruiting actually went up.""We've dealt with the military recruitment issue from several angles, and here we decided to tackle the claim that the number of military recruits went up at the height of the campus controversy.In previous PolitiFact items, we have gone into some detail about the controversial history of military recruiting at Harvard Law School, which long predated Kagan's tenure as dean from 2003-2009. But the bottom line is that military recruiters were only ever barred from the school's Office of Career Services for one semester in 2005. During that time, Kagan encouraged the military to recruit through the Harvard Law School Veterans Association, a student organization (now called the Harvard Law School Armed Forces Association). In all other years Kagan was dean at Harvard Law School, military recruiters were permitted to use the Office of Career Services (despite Kagan steadfastly lodging her opposition to the military's ""discriminatory recruitment"" based on the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy which ""deprives many men and women of courage and character from having the opportunity to serve their country in the greatest way possible."")So we are really talking here about the 2005 spring semester during which Kagan arguably made it the most difficult for military recruiters, by barring them from the Office of Career Services. ""The symbolic effect of this special treatment of military recruiters was important, but the practical effect on recruiting logistics was minimal,"" wrote Robert C. Clark, a professor and dean at Harvard Law School from 1989 to 2003, in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal on May 11, 2010.We're not big into he-said, she-said at PolitiFact, but we think a bit of point-counterpoint on Clark's statement is in order.During the confirmation hearing, Sen. Orrin Hatch cited a 2002 e-mail from an Air Force recruiter who wrote, ""Career Services Offices are the epicenter for all employer hiring activities at a law school. ... Without the support of the Career Services Office, we are relegated to wandering the halls in hopes that someone will stop and talk to us. ... Denying access to the Career Services Office is tantamount to chaining and locking the front door of the law school -- as it has the same impact on our recruiting efforts.""And a Feb. 18, 2005, letter from the Harvard Law School Veterans Association -- which was tapped by Kagan to coordinate military recruitment efforts in lieu of recruiters being afforded access to the Office of Career Services -- also suggests the 2005 policy was more than a seamless blip. The group lamented that ""Given our tiny membership, meager budget, and lack of any office space, we possess neither the time nor the resources to routinely schedule campus rooms or advertise extensively for outside organizations, as is the norm for most recruiting events."" Their effort, they wrote ""falls short of duplicating the excellent assistance provided by the HLS Office of Career Services."" And now the counterpoint. During the confirmation hearing, Sen. Patrick Leahy submitted a letter from First Lt. David M. Tressler, who is currently deployed with the U.S. Army Reserve in Afghanistan. Tressler graduated from Harvard Law School in 2006 and wrote that ""Military recruiters were never barred from campus. During the brief period when recruiters were not given access to students officially through the law school’s Office of Career Services, they still had access to students on campus through other means.""""There are only a few of us each year who joined the military while attending, or after graduation from, Harvard Law. Kagan’s decision to uphold the school’s anti-discrimination policy for a brief period of time and express disagreement with DADT did not prevent us from talking with recruiters and joining.""In fact, Tressler wrote, ""in 2005 more graduating students joined the military than any year this decade.""""To attack Ms. Kagan for a principled position she took as a law school dean that had no practical effect on military recruitment looks, from where I stand, like a political distraction,"" Tressler wrote. ""I believe that, while dean of Harvard Law School, she adequately proved her support for those who had served, were currently serving, and all those who felt called to serve, including those like me who joined upon graduation as well as those patriots who were not permitted to do so under the policy of 'Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.'""So how did all this affect the number of military recruits?We contacted the Harvard Law School Office of Public Information, which provided a breakdown on the number of graduates, by class, who went into the military: 2000 -- 02001 -- 32002 -- 22003 -- 22004 -- 32005 -- 52006 -- 32007 -- 32008 -- 22009 -- 2That's right, it went from three in 2004 to five in 2005. So Kagan is technically accurate that during the year in question, 2005, the number of recruits went up. And Tressler is correct that the five law school graduates who went into the military that year is the largest number from any class this decade. But by citing the statistic (without the numbers), Kagan suggests it backs the contention that her decision to bar recruiters from the Office of Career Services during the spring semester of 2005 had negligible, and perhaps only a symbolic, effect on military recruiting at Harvard Law School. That's a matter of dispute. While the former dean and a 2006 graduate now in the military say the policy had little real effect on recruiting, military recruiters clearly disagreed. The number of recruits in any given year at Harvard Law School is so small, we don't think citing the 2005 increase - by 2 from the previous year - settles the issue one way or the other",Half True,"June 30, 2010"
Says she was never a  member of the Georgia Log Cabin Republicans.,"Karen Handel, who wants to become the state’s first female governor, is getting a high-profile education in Republican primary politics -- bare-knuckled Georgia style. One of Handel’s opponents, former U.S. Rep. Nathan Deal, has publicly attacked Handel for her cozy relationship with the gay community earlier in her political career when she was campaigning for the Fulton County Commission and later its chairmanship. Among other things, Deal has alleged Handel was a member of the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay rights GOP organization that endorsed both her 2002 and 2003 election bids.Handel and her strategists have repeatedly denied she was ever a member of the group, including in a June 9 article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. In the article, Marc Yeager, who was president of the Georgia group in 2002 and 2003, said that Handel was a “dues-paying member of the Georgia Log Cabin Republicans from 2002 to 2004, something Handel also denies.” Deal continues to insist Handel was a member. So who’s telling the truth? To understand what’s going on here, you have to turn back the political clock seven or eight years. Back to very different campaigns. Handel was then seeking a job where Fulton County’s large and politically active gay community was a key constituency. The support of that community is vital to anyone seeking office locally. Both Republicans and Democrats aggressively court the gay vote. But in a statewide Republican primary, the dynamics change dramatically, tilting strongly conservative. In statewide races, the clout of gay voters fades. In a statewide Republican primary, the conservative vote moves to the forefront. And that vote can easily be a decisive factor in a multicandidate contest like the one in which Deal and Handel find themselves.Deal is trying to paint Handel as overly friendly with Atlanta’s gay community in an effort to cut into the most conservative part of her voter base.  Make no mistake, this is a fight to the finish. At most, only two candidates of the seven running will emerge from the July 20 GOP primary. Deal’s camp has gone for Handel’s jugular over her outreach to gay voters. And Deal’s strategists think they smell blood. Handel’s camp has responded by accusing Deal of having a “history of bigoted remarks.”A news release by the Handel camp late last week said this: “When he [Deal] found out that 8 years ago Karen Handel spoke to the Log Cabin Republicans ... it sent him into a month-long, delusional attack against her.” Deal has, among other things, accused Handel of supporting “gay adoption” during her Fulton County Commission bids. There is scant evidence of that, and PolitiFact Georgia has previously given the former congressman a “Barely True” on the Truth-O-Meter for that accusation. But the paper and electronic trail on Handel and the Log Cabin Republicans is much stronger. The Southern Voice, a newspaper that catered to the gay community and later went bankrupt, carried numerous articles about Handel’s 2002 and 2003 commission runs. And in those she is repeatedly identified as a member of the Georgia Log Cabin Republicans. Handel never asked for a correction or clarification. Handel spokesman Dan McLagan agrees with that last point. “The Southern Voice is going to say all kinds of wacky stuff,” McLagan said. “The fact a retraction was not asked for is not proof of the assertion. She probably wasn’t sitting around reading a gay tabloid.” McLagan added: “She doesn’t remember ever having been a member.” But Yeager, the Log Cabin leader at the time, said he does remember. “Karen handed me the check [for her membership dues],” he said during an interview with PolitiFact Georgia.   And he happens to be a guy who keeps a record of his e-mails. One of those, from Yeager to Log Cabin board member Cathy Dudley in March 2003, contains an attachment -- a mailing list for the hundred or so Georgia Log Cabin members at that time. The list was being used to mail monthly invites to Log Cabin meetings. Handel’s name, telephone numbers, e-mail address and home address are on that list, which was examined by PolitiFact Georgia. It clearly lists her as a dues-paying member whose membership ran through July 2003. Another attachment in a later e-mail listed her as a member through July 2004. McLagan was unimpressed. He suggested that Jamie Ensley, the current president of the Georgia Log Cabin Republicans, had membership records indicating Handel was not a member of the group. Unlike Yeager, however, Ensley declined to share membership records with PolitiFact Georgia.“Under no circumstances can I share our memberships rolls,” Ensley said. McLagan, meanwhile, questioned the motives of  Yeager, who is no longer with the Log Cabin Republicans. McLagan said Yeager’s partner is an Obama supporter. Yeager said that is true, but he stands by his statements and e-mails about Handel’s earlier membership in the Log Cabin Republicans.“My partner, Roger, ... applied for becoming an Obama delegate early in the process but never pursued it due to the time required for the whole nomination and delegate process,” Yeager said in an e-mail to the AJC. “I don’t think he ever went to any meetings. Certainly it has been no secret that he always has been and still is a Democrat. This was always a point of curiosity within the gay press with me being president of Georgia LCR [Log Cabin Republicans].”‘Nuf said, or so says McLagan. “These guys have an agenda,” McLagan said.  Handel, however, is running against fellow Republicans at this point in the race, not Democrats. And it is a fellow Republican who has accused her of belonging to the Log Cabin Republicans.What about Yeager’s e-mails that show Handel’s name appeared on the Log Cabin Republicans’ membership roll? They certainly appear genuine.“I can type up an e-mail that says anything,” McLagan said. Perhaps. But the evidence is overwhelming that Handel did indeed belong to the Georgia Log Cabin Republicans -- whether or not she remembers it. Newspapers reported it. A membership list backs it up. And the man running the organization at the time swears by it.Handel and her handlers, however, still choose to deny it",False,"June 16, 2010"
"""Handel endorsed gay adoption"" in 2003 when she was running for chairwoman of the Fulton County Commission.","Nathan Deal is portraying gubernatorial candidate Karen Handel as out of step with Georgia Republicans because she allegedly supported gay adoption seven years ago.In a statement published in the Rome Tribune, Deal lashed out at Handel for what he says were her positions in her race seven years ago for chairwoman of the Fulton County Commission. Deal’s campaign is quoted as saying: ""Actually, 2003 isn't so ‘old,’ and the truth is that Handel endorsed gay adoption when she campaigned for Fulton County Commission chair in 2003 while courting votes and fund-raising.""But did she?First, a little primer on Fulton County politics vs. Georgia politics. The gay community is a politically active and powerful force within Fulton County. Much of the community is centered in Midtown Atlanta. Making nice with that community can help you get elected in city and county politics, and both Democrats and Republicans court the gay vote.But in statewide politics the landscape tilts very conservative. What plays well in Midtown often bombs in Marietta and Moultrie. Endorsing gay adoption could demolish a Republican or Democratic bid for any statewide office in Georgia. Handel has steadfastly denied Deal’s allegation and is on the record as an opponent of gay adoption in more recent campaigns. In her successful run for secretary of state in 2006 and in her current gubernatorial bid, she has opposed allowing gay people to adopt children. Indeed, in 2006, she was criticized for that stance in an Atlanta Journal-Constitution editorial that otherwise backed her candidacy.""Although the secretary of state's office has zero influence on legislative policies, Handel’s Web site features her opinions on abortion, domestic partnerships and gay adoptions, all of which she opposes,"" said the Oct. 16, 2006, editorial.Deal’s allegation is that Handel backed gay adoption when she was running for office at the local level only to flip-flop when she got into the state arena. Deal has also accused Handel of once being a member of the Log Cabin Republicans, a GOP gay rights organization. Stay tuned. We will address that allegation in a future PolitiFact Georgia report.For this round, we concentrated solely on Deal’s assertion that Handel had once backed gay adoption. Deal’s campaign strategists base their allegation on a single statement by Marc Yeager, former president of the Georgia Log Cabin Republicans, in the now-defunct Southern Voice, a newspaper that catered to the gay community.In an Aug. 15, 2003, article, Yeager is quoted saying: ""We will be continuing our support for Karen Handel. She demonstrated in her last run that she was supportive of domestic partner benefits, and she's supported same-sex adoptions on the basis of the best interest of the child.""Enough said. Or so says the Deal camp. ""This was announced in a newspaper, and she didn’t ask for a correction because it was accurate,"" said Brian Robinson, Deal’s communication director. ""Karen Handel can’t have it both ways.""Handel’s camp said the gubernatorial hopeful never backed gay adoption.""Nathan Deal should put down the gay tabloid and try to find a real source for his false attacks,"" said Dan McLagan, a spokesman for the Handel campaign.We tried to contact Yeager numerous times, but he did not return our calls. Yeager’s comment was the only evidence we could find that Handel ever supported that position. Handel’s campaign and a half-dozen people familiar with her positions on gay rights issues in the 2003 race said she never supported gay adoption.State Rep. Jill Chambers (R-Atlanta) said she and Handel visited the Log Cabin booth at Atlanta’s 2002 Gay Pride Festival, as did other local and state politicians.""But neither one of us backed gay adoptions, certainly not publicly. It was not high on the agenda,"" Chambers said. ""We shook hands. We handed out some brochures.""Jamie Ensley, the current president of the state Log Cabin Republicans, said Handel spoke to their chapter ""many times"" during her run for the Fulton County Commission and later for chairwoman. ""But gay adoption was never an issue,"" Ensley said. There is no evidence, other than a passing statement by Yeager in an extinct newspaper, that Handel ever voiced support for gay adoptions. And in subsequent runs for office, she has repeatedly declared she opposes it. There is some smoke here -- a widely distributed publication stated that Handel supported gay adoption, and she never asked for a correction. But the bulk of evidence appears to back Handel’s denial",True,"June 7, 2010"
"On military recruiters at Harvard, Elena Kagan ""took a position and the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that she was wrong.""","One of Elena Kagan's top credentials -- that she was dean of Harvard Law School -- created some controversy on the day that President Barack Obama announced her nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. As dean, Kagan took a lead role in trying to keep military recruiters off campus because of the ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy that prevents gays and lesbians from serving openly in the military. Several Republicans pointed to that episode in their initial comments on Kagan, calling the incident troubling. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., also pointed out that the incident put her on the losing side of a Supreme Court ruling.At Harvard Law School, Barrasso said, ""She took a position and the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that she was wrong."" Barrasso said he was keeping an open mind on the nomination. We were interested in fact-checking his statement that the Supreme Court ""ruled unanimously that she was wrong."" The controversy over military recruiters began even before Kagan became dean of Harvard Law in 2003. Harvard was one of several top-tier law schools that attempted to ban military recruiters because of the policy that prevented gays and lesbians from serving openly in the military. In 2003, Kagan penned a letter to the law school community expressing her thoughts on the issue: ""I abhor the military's discriminatory recruitment policy. The importance of the military to our society -- and the extraordinary service that members of the military provide to all the rest of us -- makes this discrimination more, not less, repugnant. The military's policy deprives many men and women of courage and character from having the opportunity to serve their country in the greatest way possible. This is a profound wrong -- a moral injustice of the first order. And it is a wrong that tears at the fabric of our own community, because some of our members cannot, while others can, devote their professional careers to their country.""Congress threatened to yank federal funding for schools that banned recruiters through a measure known as the Solomon Amendment, named for Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., and first passed in 1996. Schools and recruiters tried to sort out their differences in the intervening years, with some schools providing partial access. But eventually the issue came before the Supreme Court in 2004 in a case known as Rumsfeld vs. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, known as FAIR. FAIR was an association of law schools that opposed the Solomon Amendment.In her role as a professor of law at Havard, Kagan signed onto an amicus brief (sometimes known as a ""friend of the court"" brief) filed by 40 Harvard professors that argued that the federal government should not be able to withhold funding if the schools applied the same policies to all recruiters. Harvard, for example, required all recruiters to sign forms indicating they would not discriminate against applicants based on sexual orientation. The withholding of funds interfered with the schools' freedom of expression to oppose what they felt were discriminatory policies.The Harvard law professors argued in their brief that ""this case is not -- and has never been -- about whether law schools may 'discriminate' against the military or whether they must provide 'equal access' to military recruiters. Instead, the question is whether the Solomon Amendment confers upon military recruiters the unprecedented entitlement to disregard neutral and generally applicable recruiting rules whenever a school's failure to make a special exception might incidentally hinger or preclude military recruiting. The answer is 'no.'""The Supreme Court, however, disagreed in an 8-0 ruling on March 6, 2006. The majority opinion, written by Chief Justice John Roberts, ruled against FAIR and, in doing so, rejected the claims of Kagan and the other law professors that the school had the right to enforce non-discrimination policies against the military. ""Under the statute, military recruiters must be given the same access as recruiters who comply with the policy,"" the opinion said.The court also rejected arguments that claimed that the law schools' treatment of military recruiters could be considered expression under the First Amendment. If the action itself were purely expressive, the court reasoned, the schools would not have to issue statements explaining their actions. The court compared the situation to someone who says he won't pay his income taxes because he disapproves of the Internal Revenue Service. The disapproval is protected speech, but the non-payment of taxes is not.The opinion was supported by Justices John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, David Souter, Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer joining Roberts. Justice Samuel Alito did not participate because he had not yet been seated to the court when oral arguments were made. Barrasso said Kagan ""took a position and the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that she was wrong."" The court did reject the arguments put forward by the law schools, which included FAIR and the brief filed by the Harvard professors.

"""Every citizen is entitled to the freedom of speech, but no one should have the right to use government funds or institutions to portray acts that are morally reprehensible to the vast majority of Americans.""","Last month, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst objected to a play subsequently canceled by a professor, citing security concerns, at Tarleton State University in Stephenville, 70 miles southwest of Fort Worth. Dewhurst said in a March 26 press release: ""Every citizen is entitled to the freedom of speech, but no one should have the right to use government funds or institutions to portray acts that are morally reprehensible to the vast majority of Americans."" Reprehensible acts dramatized at a state-supported university? In support of Dewhurst’s statement that the acts presented are ""morally reprehensible to the vast majority of Americans,"" Dewhurst spokesman Rich Parsons pointed to an aggregate of Gallup Polls taken in 2008 indicating that 77 percent of Americans consider themselves Christians compared with 91 percent when Gallup began tracking religious identification in 1948. When we asked what acts the lieutenant governor was referring to in the play ""Corpus Christi"" by Terrence McNally, Parsons didn’t specify them. Parsons said in an e-mail that Dewhurst generally supports artistic expression ""but he would also never support the denigration of any American’s religion."" So what are the play’s offensive acts? Tarleton State University declined to provide a copy of the abridged version of the play that students in a directing class planned to present. We checked out a copy from the Austin Public Library. The play depicts the life and death of a gay Jesus-like figure, Joshua, and his conversations with his homosexual disciples. The protagonist is born in a Corpus Christi hotel room. As an adult, Joshua wanders the desert, performs miracles and also officiates over a gay wedding; there's male-on-male kissing too and moments suggestive of sex such as a beach blanket scene and sounds of heterosexual coupling. Toward the end, Joshua has a last supper with followers before being betrayed by a friend named Judas. He is crucified. The play drew protests when it made its New York premiere in 1998, though Time magazine critic Richard Zoglin wrote: ""Years from now, when the brouhaha is past, Corpus Christi may get its due as one of McNally's best, most moving and personal works. His updating of the Christ story is witty but not patronizing, as sober and cleansing as a dip in baptismal water."" Mark Holtorf, the Tarleton State theater professor whose students had planned a single performance of the play, said he interprets the drama as a commentary on what it was like to grow up gay in Corpus Christi in the 1950's. Referring to McNally, who grew up there, Holtorf said: ""In a way, it’s somewhat autobiographical. I walked away from the play having a much better understanding of what this poor guy must have gone through.""  Holtorf said the version that was to be performed had women filling eight of 13 roles because of the preponderance of female drama students. He said the only use of government funds would have been the cost of class time devoted to the play and utilities associated with a campus building; tuition-paying students also paid about $200 out of pocket for permission to perform the play and to receive scripts. Parsons, of Dewhurst’s office, pointed us to reports on objections to the Tarleton State production. An article posted by Catholic Online calls the play ""blasphemous,"" quoting a leader of the American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property saying: ""With this play Tarleton State University is offending the honor of Our Lord, the Apostles, and 68 million Catholics. What makes it even worse is the fact that it’s taking place right before Holy Week."" The play was scheduled for the Saturday before Palm Sunday. Another Catholic Online article quotes Catholic League President Bill Donohue calling the play ""hate speech directed at Christians and (as) far more than just a ‘gay Jesus’ play."" Short of Dewhurst revealing what acts in the play he believes most Americans consider morally reprehensible, we'll assume he's referring to the provocative element that suffuses the play—depiction of a Jesus-like figure and his acolytes as gay men. We found no polling on such specifics. But the non-partisan American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, a think tank with conservative roots, recently updated a compilation of national polls that suggests adults are divided in their views of homosexuality, though attitudes have relaxed over time. In 2006, 56 percent of respondents said sexual relations between two adults of the same sex are always wrong with another 5 percent saying they almost always are wrong. The institute, quoting the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, says that in 1973, 73 percent of adults said such relations were always wrong with 7 percent saying they're almost always wrong. In a May 2007 Gallup poll, 55 percent of Americans said that homosexual relations between consenting adults should be legal, up from 32 percent in 1986, according to the institute. In 2008, a Gallup poll found 48 percent of Americans saying homosexual relations are morally acceptable and 48 percent saying they’re morally wrong, the institute said. In May 2008, a Gallup poll found 57 percent of Americans saying they feel homosexuality should be considered an acceptable alternative lifestyle; 40 percent said not. Among adults who attend church weekly, 79 percent considered sexual relations between two adults of the same sex always wrong in 2002—compared to 46 percent of respondents who attended church once a month or less, according to the institute. Daron Shaw, a University of Texas professor of government and the polling director for UT's Texas Politics Project, cautioned against assuming that widened tolerance of gay lifestyles means Americans would be comfortable with presenting a play at a public university that depicts a Jesus-like figure as gay. In Texas, Shaw speculated, 80-plus percent of residents would object. ""Close to 50 percent of Texans identify themselves as evangelical, fundamentalist, or born again,"" Shaw said in an email. ""Furthermore, if you were to actually poll-test this item, I'd be stunned if there weren't huge majorities who think a play protraying Jesus as gay would be offensive (and probably deeply offensive).""  Where does all this leave Dewhurst’s statement? Dewhurst accurately recaps the play's intended presentation at a state-supported institution, though the use of government funds would have been minimal. While he doesn't share what ""morally reprehensible"" acts he believes most Americans abhor, we assume he's upset at the play's gay aspect. Polls indicate that a large percentage of Texans see themselves as religious. And most frequent church-goers consider gay sex morally wrong. Yet that's not the ""vast majority of Americans,"" as Dewhurst put it. Americans in general are split on whether gay relations are immoral; it's unmeasured how they'd rate unspecified acts in a play",True,"April 12, 2010"
"""An attack on a healthy 22-year-old homosexual man would be more protected under the law than an attack on an eight-year-old child.""","
Criticizing federal hate crimes law, the right-leaning Liberty Institute sniffs at extending additional legal protections to victims attacked because of their sexual orientation or gender. 
The group says online that a protected classes contradict equal protection under the law, adding that ""many see the expansion of hate crimes laws as a tool to silence opposition to homosexuality and eventually silence pastors from speaking Biblically on the subject."" 
""Hate crimes law put citizens in different classes of people and protect some more than others,"" the group says on its Web site. ""For example, an attack on a healthy 22-year-old homosexual man would be more protected under the law than an attack on an eight-year-old child. Liberty Institute believes that all crimes should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law without putting citizens in classes, attempting to protect some more than others, and attempting to punish people's thoughts."" 
Eight year olds, less protected than adults? 
Jonathan Saenz, the group's Austin-based director of legislative affairs, pointed to the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which expanded federal legal protections against violent acts motivated by sexual orientation, gender, and disability. 
""Hate crimes laws give more protection under law for members of the special classes of people,"" Saenz said. ""Age is not included as a protected class for victims, sexual orientation is included as a protected class. So, an attack on a healthy 22-year-old homosexual man would be more protected under the law than an attack on an eight-year-old child."" 
Some background: The 2009 act is named for Matthew Shepard, a gay college student who died after being kidnapped, pistol-whipped and tied to a Wyoming ranch fence in near-freezing temperatures, and James Byrd Jr., a black man who was dragged behind a car to his death the same year by three white men near Byrd's home in Jasper, Texas. 
The law lets the U.S. Department of Justice help states investigate and prosecute hate crimes. In the case of five states that don't have hate crime laws, federal prosecutors can prosecute the crimes independently. 
Congress earlier put in place a law directing government to create enhanced penalties for hate crimes — motivated by actual and perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, gender, disability or sexual orientation — that occur on federal property. The combined effect of the Shepard Act and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, adopted in 1994, means that someone who attacks a healthy 22-year-old homosexual man because of his sexual orientation could be subject to a tougher sentence than someone who attacks an eight year old. 
But that's just considering those federal hate crime laws, not all the other applicable state and federal laws. 
Bill Allison, director of the Criminal Defense Clinic at the University of Texas School of Law, rates the Liberty Institute's comparison as bogus because various state and federal laws provide harsher sentences for a wide range of groups. 
Allison said: ""We give extra protection and punishment to pregnant women, to police and firefighters to children under six... the list goes on and on."" 
The Texas Penal Code, for example, increases the sentence for someone who assaults anyone 14 or younger or, conversely, 65 and older. Criminals who harm a pregnant woman's unborn child could also face additional charges. 
And under the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, a judge can require a convict to take a course in tolerance if arson, criminal mischief or reckless damage or destruction are proved beyond a reasonable doubt to have been committed against someone because of that person's race, color, disability, religion, national origin or ancestry, age, gender or sexual preference. 
Another Texas law: The minimum term of imprisonment increases to 25 years if the criminal is convicted of aggravated sexual assault on a child younger than six. 
Why have special laws for people who are attacked because of their race, sexual orientation or gender? 
Trevor Thomas, deputy communications director at the Human Rights Campaign, a national organization that advocates for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality, offers this explanation: ""Sentencing enhancements for hate crimes recognize that hate-crime perpetrators commit violent acts as a means of sending a message to society ... While a random act of violence is a tragic event that devastates, the enhancements reflect this understanding that hate crimes are unique in that they victimize an entire community of people."" 
Applying hate crimes law is complicated. If a straight man and a gay man get in a fight, it's not a hate crime unless the straight man attacked the gay man because he is homosexual, Allison said. 
In other words, a healthy 22-year-old man wouldn't be protected under the Shepard Act unless the prosecutor can prove that he was attacked because of his sexual orientation. 
George Dix, the chair of criminal law at the University of Texas at Austin, said: ""Clearly the law does permit prosecutors, judges and juries to impose more severe penalties where the victims of crimes are in certain classes. Insofar as the severity of penalties reflects an effort to extend greater protections to victims, I suppose to could be said that the law is making greater effort to protect persons in the specific 'classes.'"" 
But the law does this for a great many classes, and not just those containing people, Dix said. Under a Texas theft statute, he said, someone who steals an exotic fowl could be more severely punished than if they steal a chicken. Or, stealing fuel from a gas station could be more prosecuted than stealing it from a car. So the station owner would be more protected than the owner of the affected car. 
""Our criminal laws are full of distinctions that result in part in extending more protections to certain classes of people. No reasonable person could argue that this is inherently inappropriate,"" said Dix. 
Dix helped us reason how someone who assaulted a gay, adult male — meaning the perpetrator intentionally and knowingly caused him bodily injury, but not serious bodily injury — might fare in court in contrast to how they'd fare if they assaulted an eight year old. 
Per the Texas Penal Code, the attack on the child would be a third-degree felony, Dix said, punishable by imprisonment for a term of not more than 10 years or less than 2 years. The attack on the 22 year old would, generally, be a Class A misdemeanor, he said, normally punishable by a jail term of no more than a year. Generally, hate crimes law ""makes the offense punishable under the next highest category,"" he said. ""But for Class A misdemeanors, the effect seems to be to instead impose a minimum term of confinement of 180 days. 
Summing up: Lots of special classes have extra legal protections — many of which existed before protections were extended based on gender, gender identity and sexual orientation. 
The bottom line: Under the Shepard Act, an attack on a healthy 22-year-old homosexual man could — not would, as the Liberty Institute states — be more protected than an attack on an 8-year-old. But it takes a contortion to reach that conclusion. The statement incorrectly intimates that hate crimes laws are the only ones on the books, ignoring the web of other state and federal criminal laws offering protections to vulnerable groups of people — including children",Half True,"March 30, 2010"
"""The Massachusetts Supreme Court...defined marriage as simply, quote, the establishment of intimacy ... I guess that would mean if you really had affection for your horse, I guess you could marry your horse.""","J.D. Hayworth, the former congressman running against Sen. John McCain in the Arizona Republican primary, was known for making provocative points as a conservative radio talk show host. He's proving every bit as provocative on the campaign trail. In an interview on radio station WORL in Orlando on March 14, 2010, Hayworth was talking about same-sex marriage. He's very much against it. But it was his comments about the prospect of someone walking down the aisle in Massachusetts with a horse that landed Hayworth in the national political news cycle. Let's get the full quote straight from the horse's mouth: ""You see, the Massachusetts Supreme Court, when it started this move toward same-sex marriage, actually defined marriage -- now get this -- it defined marriage as simply, quote, the establishment of intimacy,"" Hayworth said. ""Now how dangerous is that? I mean, I don't mean to be absurd about it, but I guess I can make the point of absurdity with an absurd point -- I guess that would mean if you really had affection for your horse, I guess you could marry your horse. It's just the wrong way to go, and the only way to protect the institution of marriage is with that federal marriage amendment that I support."" Whoa there. Really? Hayworth is talking about a landmark 2003 case in which the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled, 4-3, that gay couples have the right to marry under the state's Constitution. We took a long look at the 45-page decision in the case, Goodridge vs. the Department of Public Health. Since Hayworth suggested that he was quoting the phrase ""the establishment of intimacy,"" we searched for that first. It's not there. The word ""intimacy"" appears five times in the 45-page decision (actually six times, but one is a duplicate), but never in the context of being the sole definition of marriage. Here they are: * One section talks about how the Supreme Court has affirmed that ""the core concept of common human dignity protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution precludes government intrusion into the deeply personal realms of consensual adult expressions of intimacy and one's choice of an intimate partner."" * ""Marriage also bestows enormous private and social advantages on those who choose to marry. Civil marriage is at once a deeply personal commitment to another human being and a highly public celebration of the ideals of mutuality, companionship, intimacy, fidelity, and family."" * ""Whether and whom to marry, how to express sexual intimacy, and whether and how to establish a family -- these are among the most basic of every individual's liberty and due process rights."" * ""Our laws of civil marriage do not privilege procreative heterosexual intercourse between married people above every other form of adult intimacy and every other means of creating a family."" * ""Similarly, the Supreme Court has called for increased due process protection when individual privacy and intimacy are threatened by unnecessary government imposition."" We're not sure how Hayworth gets from any of these to the court defining marriage as simply the establishment of intimacy. Chief Justice Margaret H. Marshall of the state's Supreme Judicial Court began the ruling with these words: ""Marriage is a vital social institution. The exclusive commitment of two individuals to each other nurtures love and mutual support; it brings stability to our society. For those who choose to marry, and for their children, marriage provides an abundance of legal, financial, and social benefits. In return it imposes weighty legal, financial, and social obligations. The question before us is whether, consistent with the Massachusetts Constitution, the Commonwealth may deny the protections, benefits, and obligations conferred by civil marriage to two individuals of the same sex who wish to marry. We conclude that it may not. ""We are mindful that our decision marks a change in the history of our marriage law,"" Marshall wrote. ""Many people hold deep-seated religious, moral, and ethical convictions that marriage should be limited to the union of one man and one woman, and that homosexual conduct is immoral. Many hold equally strong religious, moral, and ethical convictions that same-sex couples are entitled to be married, and that homosexual persons should be treated no differently than their heterosexual neighbors. Neither view answers the question before us. Our concern is with the Massachusetts Constitution as a charter of governance for every person properly within its reach."" We italicized ""person"" to make a point. Justice John Greaney, who concurred, wrote in the ruling, ""We construe civil marriage to mean the voluntary union of two persons as spouses, to the exclusion of all others."" Again the word ""persons."" Moreover, Greaney noted that the ruling was strictly about whether people of the same sex could marry and ""it leaves intact the Legislature's broad discretion to regulate marriage."" Take a look at Massachusetts laws regarding who can marry (which includes age and residency requirements and prohibitions on marrying relatives) and you'll see the word ""persons"" over and over. Seems pretty straightforward to us, but we checked with a few legal experts in Massachusetts to get their take. ""The word 'establishment' doesn't occur in the opinion, and the six appearances of the word 'intimacy' aren't free-standing, so that the statement that the SJC 'defined' marriage 'simply' as 'the establishment of intimacy' is false,"" said Mark Tushnet a law professor at Harvard Law School. ""That's not to say that one couldn't extend the underlying principles articulated in Goodridge to other forms of intimacy, including, I suppose, bestiality, but there's nothing in Goodridge itself saying that the principles extend that far. And of course one need not extend the principles if there's some reason not to do so, as there surely would be in the case of bestiality."" Carissa Cunningham, director of public affairs for Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, which handled the Goodridge case, called Hayworth's comment ""silly."" ""It's so far off base,"" Cunningham said. The ruling, she said, ""didn't change anything there about the marriage law in Massachusetts,"" which very clearly spells out that marriage is only for people. We might have chalked this one up to a one-time misstatement, a bit of hyperbole on the long campaign trail, and simply rated it False. But then Hayworth went on The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC on March 15, 2010, and doubled down. Here's how that went: Maddow: ""Where does the establishment of intimacy thing come from? Where in Massachusetts law or in the Supreme Court ruling does it say the establishment of intimacy?"" Maddow said she had spent the afternoon looking for it, but couldn't find it anywhere. Hayworth: ""As we went back and reviewed that document back when the argument was made, the high court in Massachusetts defined marriage in a rather amorphous fashion, simply as quote, the establishment of intimacy. Now I think we all agree there's much more to marriage than that."" Maddow: ""Sir, I'm sorry, it didn't."" Hayworth: ""Okay, you and I have a disagreement."" Maddow then cited several uses of the word ""intimacy"" in the Supreme Court ruling. Maddow: ""The establishment of intimacy as the definition of marriage, it's just not there, let alone the horse thing. What you said about the establishment of intimacy being the definition of marriage in Massachusetts, I don't think it's true, sir."" Hayworth: ""Well, that's fine. You and I can have a disagreement about that."" Maddow: ""Well, it either is true or it isn't, it’s empirical."" Hayworth: ""I appreciate the fact that we have a disagreement on that."" We're with Maddow here. This isn't a matter of legal interpretation. The Massachusetts Supreme Court did not define marriage ""simply as quote, the establishment of intimacy."" And when Hayworth inserts the word ""quote,"" the expectation is that he's directly quoting the phrase ""establishment of intimacy"" from the ruling. He's not. The ruling doesn't contain that phrase. Hayworth prefaced his statement by saying he was making an absurd point. We'll give him that. It's absurd, all right. It's also wrong",False Pants on Fire,"March 18, 2010"
"Challenger Tim Tuggey ""is a lobbyist who donated over $41,000 to Democrats who support abortion and same-sex marriage.""","
Ken Mercer, a Republican on the State Board of Education facing a challenger in the March 2 primary, popped a double-edged audio ad online earlier this month.

The spot opens with Mercer’s two daughters calling him a rock-solid conservative. ""But what about Dad’s opponent?"" one says, without naming the foe, lobbyist Tim Tuggey.

The other replies: ""Dad’s opponent is a lobbyist who donated over $41,000 to Democrats who support abortion and same-sex marriage.""

Mercer closes: ""You bet, I approve this message.""

But would the Texas Truth-O-Meter approve? We decided to appraise Tuggey’s donations and the viewpoints of Democrats who fielded his contributions.

Mercer shared with us a list indicating Tuggey has given nearly $43,000 to 19 Democratic candidates and three pro-Democratic political committees since 2001.

He's right. Our check of state and federal records shows that Tuggey's donations to Democrats amounted to $33,616 to nine candidates for federal office and three national political committees plus $9,100 donated to 10 Democratic candidates for state office.

Tuggey doesn’t deny he’s helped Democrats. But he also says that since 2004, he and his law firm have given about three times as much money to Republicans.

On his campaign Web site, he notes that his firm has represented the Bexar County Republican Party at no charge. The site says his firm also represented the state’s Republican U.S. House members in the last round of redistricting litigation and it represents only Republicans in campaign and ethics disputes.

Tuggey initially told us all his Democratic donations occurred because he was helping clients advance issues such as keeping taxes low or funding veterans’ care. He later conceded that in some cases, he pitched in for candidates simply because they asked for a donation.

Mercer said the second part of his blast—that the Tuggey-assisted Democrats ""support abortion and same-sex marriage"" is based on the Democratic Party platform.

""The Republican platform is clearly pro-life (and anti-abortion) and pro-traditional marriage,"" Mercer said. ""The Democrat Party platform is not.""

Mercer didn’t say so, but his ad's reference to Democrats supporting abortion was a shorthand stab that absurdly suggests Democrats want abortions to occur — a claim that's not the same as favoring a woman's right to have an abortion.

Besides, not all Democrats support abortion rights. ""We are a big-tent party,"" said Kirsten Gray, spokeswoman for the state Democrats. ""There are Democrats who support the right of a woman to terminate her pregnancy and there are Democrats who don’t."" 
As for where Democrats stand on same-sex marriage, we didn't check with every Democrat who got a Tuggey donation. But one of them, state Sen. Carlos Uresti of San Antonio, said he’s never supported same-sex marriage.

""Absolutely not,"" Uresti said. ""I’m a Marine, damnit."" (Uresti said he voted in 2005 in favor of placing a proposed constitutional ban on gay marriage before voters, who later approved the proposal. In the official House record, however, Uresti is listed as absent from the floor vote that advanced the measure.)

Mercer's reasoning presumes that every Democrat who fielded a Tuggey donation hews to the party’s state and national platforms, statements of beliefs drafted and adopted by party convention delegates every two years at the state level and every four years at the national level. So we looked for language relating to abortion and same-sex marriage in the latest Democratic platforms.

What we found: The state party platform of 2008 states Texas Democrats ""trust the women of Texas to make personal and responsible decisions about when and whether to bear children, in consultation with their family, their physician, personal conscience or their God, rather than having these personal decisions made by politicians.""

Texas Democrats also ""support prevention measures which have proven effective at reducing unintended pregnancies, and which would reduce the rate of abortion when made affordable, accessible, and available as effective long-term programs,"" the platform states.

The national Democratic platform of 2008 states: ""The Democratic Party strongly and unequivocally supports Roe v. Wade (the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion) and a woman's right to choose a safe and legal abortion, regardless of ability to pay, and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right.""

Same-sex marriage isn't mentioned in the state Democrats’ platform. But there is language indicating the party believes in protecting personal privacy and opposing discrimination in ""all forms.""

The national Democratic platform states: ""We support the full inclusion of all families, including same-sex couples, in the life of our nation, and support equal responsibility, benefits, and protections. We will enact a comprehensive bipartisan employment non-discrimination act. We oppose the Defense of Marriage Act and all attempts to use this issue to divide us.""

The Defense of Marriage Act defines marriage as a legal union between one man and one woman for purposes of all federal laws, and provides that states need not recognize a marriage from another state if it is between persons of the same sex.

So does Mercer’s ad hold up?

Mercer got the math part right. Tuggey actually gave more than $42,000 to Democrats or Democratic committees, though Mercer's ad overlooks Tuggey's donations to Republicans and the history of Tuggey’s firm representing the Bexar County Republican Party and GOP candidates.

But the second part of Mercer's advertising statement doesn't add up.

For starters, Mercer doesn't back up his presumption that every Democrat hews to the party's platform. It also doesn't stand to reason that support for same-sex marriage amounts to non-support of traditional marriage, as Mercer said.

In Mercer's favor: Both the state and national Democratic Party platforms signal Democratic support for abortion rights. But the 2008 state platform doesn't address same-sex marriage while the national platform backs equal protections for same-sex couples with no reference to marriage.

Mercer accurately tallied Tuggey's donations to Democrats, but made sweeping judgments unsupported by facts",True,"March 1, 2010"
Says Bill White is for gay marriage.,"
The Republican Party of Texas debuted an online attack ad Dec. 2, 2009, casting Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Bill White, the former Houston mayor, as too liberal for Texas tastes.

The GOP's spot muffles the audio from a White advertisement while blaring the Platters' oldie ""The Great Pretender"" and suggesting White isn't as moderate as he claims.

And the ad includes a stab that might wound White's appeal to many Texans: ""Favor gay marriage? Bill White's for it.""

We weren't aware of White's pro-gay-marriage stance.

As evidence, the Republican Party pointed to White's vote against a ban on gay marriage that was proposed as a constitutional amendment in 2005. The ban passed statewide with 76 percent of the vote, two years after Lawrence v. Texas, a landmark case that decriminalized sodomy in Texas.

White's campaign countered that White has since said that his 2005 vote wasn't a vote for gay marriage. His campaign spokeswoman Katy Bacon said White wasn't available for comment and pointed us to the only public statement White has made about the Republicans' ad, reported in a Dec. 12 article in the Dallas Voice. In an e-mail to the publication, which touts itself as a media source for the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community, White said his position is the same as that of Barack Obama, who endorses civil unions but does not support same-sex marriage.

Obama supports unions that would give same-sex partners legal rights and privileges equal to those of married couples on a state-by-state basis, including the right to assist a partner during an emergency, equal health insurance, employment benefits and property rights.

Unlike marriage, civil unions aren't recognized in all states. For instance, even if you had joined in a civil union with your partner in Vermont, you wouldn't be able to visit that person in the ICU after a head-on collision in Texas — a state that doesn't honor civil unions.

""Contrary to generally held assumptions, civil unions do not provide the same protections as does a marriage in terms of legal and financial rights, benefits and protections,"" said Yolanda Padilla, a professor of social work and women's studies at the University of Texas at Austin. ""These are not minor differences, but indisputably place gay couples in a very vulnerable position.""

White, who received the Political Equality Award in 2009 for his commitment to the Houston community from gay rights organization the Human Rights Campaign, said as mayor it was his job to work for everyone. For the same reason, he has said he refrained from taking sides in the gay marriage debate.

""As mayor, I avoid commenting on state and federal laws and policies I do not influence. I intend to vote 'no' on the proposed state constitutional amendment to protest its use as a wedge issue,"" White told Houston's GLBT Political Caucus Political Action Committee, according to a 2005 Houston Chronicle article that the Republican Party's video ad cited as evidence of his support for gay marriage.

Now that he's running for governor, White told the Dallas Voice that he intends ""to represent all Texans, and I expected to be attacked for this."" But that isn't the same as championing same-sex marriage",False,"January 12, 2010"
"Other Western countries have ended their ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policies.","
President Barack Obama has repeatedly said that he plans to repeal the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" rule, which prevents openly gay and lesbian people from serving in the military.

 

But so far, no go.

 


Meet the Press

host David Gregory asked Michigan Democrat Carl Levin, who chairs the Senate's Armed Services Committee, whether Obama would follow through on his promise.

 

""I think he will and he can,"" Levin said on the program on Oct. 11, 2009. ""I think it has to be done in the right way, which is to get a buy-in from the military, which I think is now possible. Other militaries in the West, the British and other Western armies, have ended this discriminatory policy. We can do it successfully.""

 

Before we dig into Levin's claim that other Western countries have already repealed similar policies, some background: On the campaign trail, Obama wrote an open letter to the LGBT — lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender — community, stating that, as president, he would ""bring about real change for all LGBT Americans."" Chief among his efforts would be a repeal of the military's rule, one that was put into place during the Clinton administration.

 

That's easier said than done, however. Obama cannot simply undo ""don't ask, don't tell"" — it must be repealed by Congress. So, when Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in March 2009 that the administration was not actively pursuing a rule change, we gave Obama a

Stalled

on our Obameter for his promise to overturn the policy.

 

The issue was back in the news Oct. 11 when Obama spoke at a gathering of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender civil rights organization. He told the group: ""I'm working with the Pentagon, its leadership and the members of the House and Senate on ending this policy.""

 

Levin hopes the policy will change. To underscore his optimism, he pointed out that the United States wouldn't be the first country to repeal laws banning gays from the military.

 

Australia ended its ban on homosexuals in the military in 1992, as did Canada.

 

Levin is also right that Britain does not prohibit gays and lesbians from serving. Its ban was lifted in 2000, when the European Court of Human Rights settled a two-year legal battle involving four homosexual service members.

 

All told, at least 25 Western countries have no ban on gays and lesbians in the military, according to the Palm Center, a public policy think tank associated with the University of California at Santa Barbara. As of June 2009, that list includes Germany, Austria, Spain, Finland and France.

 

So, Levin is correct that other Western countries, including Britain, have ended policies that prevent gays and lesbians from serving openly",True,"October 12, 2009"
"""The president of the United States ... agrees with me"" that marriage should be between a man and a woman.","
It's not often that we can check a Miss USA contestant with our Truth-O-Meter. So when Miss California USA Carrie Prejean, the runner-up in the Miss USA competition, likened her much-discussed, pageant-night response to a question about gay marriage to President Barack Obama's beliefs, we decided it was time.
 
The similarity of the statements made by Miss California and Obama was raised during a May 12 news conference in which pageant owner Donald Trump announced that Prejean could retain her crown as Miss California USA even though she failed to reveal she had posed in her underwear as a teenager. The Donald also came to Prejean's defense about her gay marriage comments.
 
""It's the same answer that the president of the United States gave,"" Trump said. ""She gave an honorable answer. She gave an answer from her heart.""
 
Said Prejean: ""I was given a question asking for my opinion and I stated my honest belief. Not only do I hold this belief but, as Mr. Trump said, the president of the United States, the secretary of state and many Americans agree with me in this belief.""
 
Let's roll the tape on Prejean's statement during the Miss USA competition on April 19, 2009.
 
One of the celebrity judges, Perez Hilton, asked whether other states should follow Vermont's lead in legalizing same-sex marriage.
 
Here's the part of Prejean's answer that matters: ""I think in my country, in my family, I think that I believe that a marriage should be between a man and a woman. No offense to anybody out there, but that's how I was raised.""
 
Controversy followed.
 
So let's see how that stacks up to Obama's stated position on same-sex marriage:
 
* ""You know, I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman."" (an interview with ABC's Jake Tapper, June 16, 2008)
 
* ""I believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman. Now, for me as a Christian, it's also a sacred union. You know, God's in the mix."" (an interview with Rev. Rick Warren, Aug. 16, 2008)
 
* ""I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage."" (an MTV interview, Nov. 1, 2008)
 
Sounds about the same to us.
 
Now, we should note that with all of these quotes during the presidential campaign, Obama quickly followed up by noting his support for civil unions.
 
The Jake Tapper interview is as representative of Obama's fuller position as any. In it, Obama said, ""I'm a strong supporter of civil unions. ... You know, I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman, but I also think that same-sex partners should be able to visit each other in hospitals, they should be able to transfer property, they should be able to get the same federal rights and benefits that are conferred onto married couples. And so, you know, as president, my job is to make sure that the federal government is not discriminating and that we maintain the federal government's historic role in not meddling with what states are doing when it comes to marriage law.""
 
Compare that to Prejean's comments to Fox's Greta Van Susteren on April 30.
 
""My thought on civil unions? You know what, Greta, I don't have the answers to everything. I'm not running for political office.

I think that people that are homosexual should have some rights, you know, hospital rights, and things like that.""

"""Mr. Warren compared same-sex couples to incest.""","
One of the first controversies faced by freshly elected Barack Obama came with his selection of evangelical Rev. Rick Warren to deliver the invocation at his Jan. 20 inauguration.
 

Although viewed by some as a moderate, Warren's outspoken support of California's recently passed Proposition 8 — which amended the state constitution to ban gay marriage — angered some in Obama's liberal base, particularly those who support gay marriage.
 

In the days after Obama announced that Warren would deliver the invocation, one of the popular sound bites coming from opponents was an accusation that Warren recently likened gay couples to incest.
 

Leading the charge was U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who is openly gay.
 

""Mr. Warren compared same-sex couples to incest,"" Frank said in an interview on CNN's

Late Edition

on Dec. 21, 2008. ""I found that deeply offensive and unfair.""
 

Frank repeated his objections to Obama's pick during an interview with MSNBC the following day: ""I think Rick Warren's comments comparing same-sex relationships to incest is deeply offensive, wildly inaccurate and very socially disruptive.""
 

The comments Frank is referring to come from an interview Warren gave in mid December to Steven Waldman, editor in chief of Beliefnet.
 

Context is the critical thing here, so we'll provide a generous helping of Warren's statements to give you a complete view:


Waldman: Do you support civil unions or domestic partnerships?

Warren: I don't know if I'd use the term there. But I support full equal rights for everybody in America. I don't believe we should have unequal rights depending on particular lifestyles, or whatever stuff like that. So I fully support equal rights.

Waldman: What about partnership benefits in terms of insurance or hospital visitation?

Warren:  ""Not a problem with me ... I'm not opposed to that as much as I'm opposed to the redefinition of a 5,000-year-old definition of marriage. I'm opposed to having a brother and sister be together and call that marriage. I'm opposed to an older guy marrying a child and calling that a marriage. I'm opposed to one guy having multiple wives and calling that marriage.""

Q: ""Do you think those are equivalent to gays getting married?""

A: ""Oh, I do. For 5,000 years marriage has been defined by every single culture and every single religion...as a man and a woman.""


We'll note here that Warren's statement about the 5,000-year history of marriage seems wrong on its face, given that several cultures and religions have accepted polygamy. But we're not rating that statement here, just the allegation that he compared gay couples to incest.


On the one hand, Warren did throw out examples of brothers and sisters marrying (incest) or an adult marrying a child (pedophilia) in the context of explaining his opposition to gay marriage. But they were cited as examples of unions outside his definition of marriage. And he agreed that same-sex couples would be another.
 

Warren did not, however, compare ""same-sex relationships to incest"" or say they are similar. He only said they all fall outside his definition of marriage. That's an important distinction.
 

In fact, Warren noted that he is okay with partnership benefits for same-sex couples. Later in the interview, Warren noted that he has ""many gay friends. I've eaten dinner in gay homes. No church has probably done more for people with AIDS than Saddlebrook Church. Kay (his wife) and I have given millions of dollars out of the

Purpose Driven Life

helping people who got AIDS through gay relationships. So they can't accuse me of homophobia. I just don't believe in the redefinition of marriage.""
 

For his part, Obama opposes gay marriage, though he supports extending ""full and equal rights and benefits to same-sex couples under both state and federal law."" And Obama opposed Proposition 8, calling it ""divisive and discriminatory.""
 

While noting that he differs with Warren on some issues, Obama defended Warren's selection, saying, ""During the course of the entire inaugural festivities, there are going to be a wide range of viewpoints that are presented. And that's how it should be, because that's what America is about.""
 

Frank agreed that ""everybody should speak, and there could be a dialogue."" But, he said, ""giving that kind of mark of approval and honor to someone who has frankly spoken in ways that I and many others have found personally very offensive, I thought that was a mistake for the president-elect to do.""
 

You can argue the appropriateness of Obama's choice, and you can argue the appropriateness of Warren citing examples of incest in the context of explaining his opposition to gay marriage, but Frank distorts Warren's words when he says Warren ""compared same-sex couples to incest."" He didn't. He just cited them as types of relationships that should not be eligible for marriage",True,"January 13, 2009"
"Obama ""supports hate-crimes expansion ... potentially putting churches at risk if they preach the truth about homosexuality.""","
A letter from the conservative group Focus on the Family Action makes a multifaceted attack on Sen. Barack Obama in an attempt to portray him as someone who would be ""the most left-wing president in our nation's history."" The article, written for the organization's Web site and widely circulated via chain e-mail, tries to paint Obama as bad for families, accusing him of everything from trying to further ""the homosexual agenda"" to being soft on the war against terrorists.
 
Focus on the Family Action is the lobbying arm of Focus on the Family, an organization founded by evangelical Christian Dr. James Dobson.
 
One of the claims in the article, written by Tom Minnery, senior vice president of Focus on the Family Action, states: ""He (Obama) has pledged to homosexual leaders that he will sign the Employment Non-Discrimination Act ... (forcing businesses to defend themselves against discrimination lawsuits should they not hire a particular candidate who then announces he or she is homosexual or transsexual). He also supports hate-crimes expansion ... (potentially putting churches at risk if they preach the truth about homosexuality).""
 
First off, Obama has, in fact, strongly supported the Employment Non-Discrimination Act and hate crime expansion. It's the bits that Minnery puts in parentheses that are misleading.
 
We'll take these one at a time.
 
The Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2007 would make it unlawful for employers to discriminate against an individual on the basis of actual or perceived sexual orientation. The law would provide employment protections to gay, lesbian and bisexual employees similar to those in the Civil Rights Act.
 
The bill passed the House and has come to the Senate. Obama not only supports that measure, but would support expanding it to include gender identity as well, according to his campaign Web site.
 
Focus on the Family has long been opposed to the legislation.
 
Minnery told PolitiFact it could lead to this scenario: ""Someone applies for a job and they are turned down, and later they identify themselves as a homosexual and claim that is why they weren't hired. How is an employer supposed to defend themselves against that charge? Proving a negative is nearly impossible.""
 
Particularly vulnerable are businesses that have religious people working for them, he said. Suppose, he said, that the person doing the hiring has a Bible on his or her desk and the applicant is put off by that, and claims later that the person had an agenda against homosexuals. If the new law is passed, he said, that applicant would be able to file a claim against the company.
 
""That's a possibility here,"" Minnery said.
 
Hardly, said Arthur Leonard, a professor of law at New York Law School and an expert in gay rights and discrimination based on sexual orientation.
 
""They have to have known or thought the person was gay for there to be a discrimination claim,"" Leonard said.
 
Brian Moulton, associate counsel for Human Rights Campaign, a strong proponent of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, said Minnery's hypothetical scenario is a red herring.
 
""The burden of proof under ENDA is on the employee who has made a claim of discrimination,"" Moulton said.
 
Twenty states already have these kinds of discrimination laws, he said, and there has been no run of unsubstantiated lawsuits.
 
""If this were a real concern, we would have long ago seen this present itself,"" Moulton said. ""The importance of the bill is that people who are losing their jobs because of their sexual orientation have no recourse. That's the real problem.""
 
Minnery's expressed concern about the expansion of hate-crime laws as ""potentially putting churches at risk if they preach the truth about homosexuality"" is similarly off base. An amendment co-sponsored by Obama sought to expand federal hate crime laws to include sexual orientation and gender identity.
 
According to Minnery, that could lead to this scenario: Someone hears a sermon about the Bible teachings on homosexuality and then goes out and commits a crime against an innocent person; they claim they got the impetus from the church pulpit; and then the church gets charged with a hate crime.
 
""It would have a chilling effect on teaching that part of the Bible that deals with homosexuality,"" Minnery said.
 
Leonard, the law professor, said: ""That's ridiculous.""
 
The First Amendment would protect the church against any kind of action like that, Leonard said.
 
""No sane prosecuting attorney in the United States would go after a church due to a preacher making a sermon based on the Biblical teachings about homosexuality,"" Leonard said.
 
Moulton, of Human Rights Campaign, noted that 32 states have hate crime laws that cover sexual orientation and, he said, ""you aren't seeing members of the clergy being prosecuted under that state law for preaching about homosexuality.""
 
The hate crime legislation specifically notes that it will not impact anyone's First Amendment rights, including freedom of speech and religion. Is there such an instance where a church or pastor could be at risk under the law?
 
""If you say, 'Gay people are evil and should be killed and here's a gun,' then yes,"" Moulton said. ""But someone simply expressing what their religious tradition says about homosexuality from the pulpit, no.""
 
Although the Senate passed the expanded hate crimes legislation backed by Obama in September 2007, negotiators in the House and Senate did not include it as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, and it stalled.
 
It's fair enough to take issue with Obama on his support of the two measures — certainly they were highly controversial and hotly debated. But Minnery's characterizations of what the bills would mean are misleading",False,"April 23, 2008"

This is a reference to a question that was asked in a Democratic debate in New Hampshire in September 2007. During the debate, Allison King of New England Cable News talked about a controversial fairy tale about a prince who marries another prince that was taught to a second-grade class in Massachusetts. The Dutch tale, called

King and King,

is about a prince whose mother pressures him to find a princess but who ends up falling in love with and marrying a princess' brother.
 
Two parents filed a lawsuit, saying they were upset that a book with homosexual themes was taught to their 7-year-olds without alerting them first. The lawsuit was dismissed.
 
King asked if the Democratic candidates would be comfortable having the story read to their children as part of their school curriculum.
 
The question was first put to Sen. John Edwards, who responded, ""Yes, absolutely.""
 
Edwards went on to say that he wants his children to understand the discrimination that gay and lesbian couples face.
 
Asked how he felt about it, Obama responded, ""You know, I feel very similar to John. You know, the fact is my 9-year-old and my 6-year-old I think are already aware that there are same-sex couples. My wife and I have talked about it. One of the things I want to communicate to my children is not to be afraid of people who are different, because there have been times in our history where I was considered different, or Bill Richardson was considered different.
 
""And one of the things I think the next president has to do is to stop fanning people's fears. If we spend all our time feeding the American people fear and conflict and division, then they become fearful and conflicted and divided.
 
""And if we feed them hope and we feed them reason and tolerance, then they will become tolerant and reasonable and hopeful.""
 
Minnery said that means Obama supports teaching about homosexuality in elementary schools.
 
""That's obviously the agenda of that book,"" Minnery said. ""If you assent to teaching that book, you assent to that agenda. It's the same thing. They didn't say, 'I'm no longer speaking as a Democratic candidate.' ""
 
Obama's campaign did not respond to questions about the Focus on the Family Action statement. But there's nothing in Obama's stated education platform that speaks to any initiative to require or encourage teaching second-graders about homosexuality.
 
In fact, the question in the debate was whether the candidates would be comfortable if that book was taught to their child in school. Obama said he would be okay with it. Focus on the Family's statement is a stretch at best",True,"April 15, 2008"
"""He told gay organizers in Massachusetts he would be a stronger advocate for special rights than even Ted Kennedy.""","
A day ahead of the Florida primary, John McCain unleashed an attack on rival Mitt Romney in an automatic phone call to Republican voters.
 
It's identical to something Rudy Giuliani said about Romney when the former New York mayor was still in the race. We examined the Giuliani charge and concluded it was

Mostly True.

 
As reported by

Politico.com

, the McCain robocall is a woman apparently concerned about Romney's social conservative record. A McCain spokesman confirmed for us that the call came from the campaign but did not provide the official text.
 
Here is the transcript of the call courtesy of

Politico

:
 
""I'm calling with an urgent Mitt Romney [unintelligible]""
 
""We care deeply about traditional values and protecting families. And we need someone who will not waver in the White House: ending abortion, preserving the sanctity of marriage, stopping the trash on the airwaves and attempts to ban God from every corner of society. These issues are core to our being.
 
""Mitt Romney thinks he can fool us. He supported abortion on demand, even allowed a law mandating taxpayer funding for abortion. He says he changed his mind, but he still hasn't changed the law. He told gay organizers in Massachusetts he would be a stronger advocate for special rights than even Ted Kennedy. Now, it's something different.
 
""Unfortunately, on issue after issue Mitt Romney has treated social issues voters as fools, thinking we won't catch on. Sorry, Mitt, we know you aren't trustworthy on the most important issue and you aren't a conservative.
 
""Paid for by John McCain 2008.""
 
The statement the the call refers to comes from Romney's 1994 U.S. Senate campaign against Kennedy. During the race, Romney wrote a letter to the Log Cabin Republicans, a group of gay Republicans, thanking them for their support.
 
""For some voters it might be enough for me to simply match my opponent's record in this area,"" Romney wrote in October 1994. ""But I believe we can and must do better. If we are to achieve the goals we share, we must make equality for gays and lesbians a mainstream concern. My opponent cannot do this. I can and will",Mostly True,"January 31, 2008"
"""He's (Romney) the one who said that he would be to the left of Teddy Kennedy on gay rights.""","
While Romney never said he was ""to the left of Teddy Kennedy on gay rights,"" Romney did reach out to gay and lesbian voters during his failed 1994 bid for Kennedy's Senate seat. More to the point, Romney said he could outperform Kennedy on gay and lesbian issues.
 
In an October 1994 letter to the Massachusetts chapter of the Log Cabin Republicans, a GOP gay rights group, Romney wrote, ""For some voters it might be enough for me to simply match my opponent's record in this area. But I believe we can and must do better.""
 
And during an August 1994 question and answer session with the Boston gay and lesbian newspaper

Bay Windows,

Romney said he could be a more effective advocate for gay rights than Kennedy because he is a Republican. ""When Ted Kennedy speaks on gay rights, he's seen as an extremist. When Mitt Romney speaks on gay rights he's seen as a centrist and a moderate,"" he said.
 
By 2002, when Romney defeated Democrat Shannon O'Brien to become Massachusetts' governor, he had backed off his support of gay rights. O'Brien said she would support legislation to legalize gay marriage, while Romney said he would not. After Romney won the election, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in 2004 that gays and lesbians must be allowed to marry in Massachusetts, making it the first state to confer that right. Romney fought it every step of the way.
 
While he didn't say that he would ""be to the left of Teddy Kennedy on gay rights,"" he did say he would be a more effective gay rights advocate than Kennedy because of his centrist/moderate stance",Mostly True,"December 11, 2007"
"""I don't think that Rudy or Fred or John McCain support the marriage amendment.""","
In an interview on MSNBC, Romney tried to turn the tables on his Republican rivals -- who have accused him of flip-flopping on various issues -- by saying he was more consistent on gay marriage than they have been.
 
He said, ""I don't think that Rudy (Giuliani) or Fred (Thompson) or John McCain support the marriage amendment. And I think they're in error on that one.""
 
Indeed, Romney is the only Republican front-runner unequivocally backing a constitutional gay marriage ban.
 
Giuliani, Thompson and McCain share his opposition to same-sex marriage but they vary in how they would address the issue at the federal level. Romney is the only Republican front-runner to support an amendment to the Constitution, such as the one that failed in Congress last year, which would limit marriage to male-female unions.
 
McCain, who actively opposed the 2006 amendment attempt on the grounds that it was unnecessary and would violate states' rights, says that he would only support such an amendment if the Supreme Court began to strike down state-level gay marriage bans.
 
Thompson has proposed a constitutional amendment that would not ban gay marriages, but would free states from the obligation to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. That provision was included in the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which Thompson and McCain both supported, but it is still being challenged in the courts. A constitutional amendment would preempt any judicial challenge to the existing law.
 
A spokesman for Giuliani said the former mayor ""does not support a federal marriage amendment at this time."" Giuliani told CNN's Larry King in February 2007 that he would not support a constitutional amendment, ""unless all of a sudden lots of states do what Massachusetts does and kind of come at it from the other side and decide that the Constitution says that -- that you cannot have marriage between a man and a woman. If it stays the way it is, you don't need one",True,"October 5, 2007"
"""I have not changed my position on the (gay) marriage amendment or anything else related to marriage.""","
In a Sept. 14, 2007 interview on MSNBC, Romney said, ""I have not changed my position on the marriage amendment or anything else related to marriage that ...you know, I think the New York Times said that I had changed my tone.""
 
Here's a look at his comments over the years:
 
In 1994, as a candidate for the U.S. Senate, he told a Boston-area gay newspaper that the definition of marriage was a ""state issue as you know -- the authorization of marriage on a same-sex basis falls under state jurisdiction.""
 
During his Senate race, Romney wrote in a letter to the Massachusetts branch of the Log Cabin Republicans, ""I am more convinced than ever before that as we seek to establish full equality for America's gay and lesbian citizens, I will provide more effective leadership than my opponent."" He promised the group that he would support laws preventing discrimination against gays and lesbians in the workplace and implied his hope for the eventual full integration of gays in the military.
 
But even in 1994, he clearly opposed legalizing same-sex marriage, telling the Bay Windows newspaper that he backed the current governor's position that the law should only uphold male-female marriages.
 
In 2002, when Romney was governor, his wife, son and daughter-in-law signed a petition supporting a proposed amendment to the Massachusetts constitution, that would not only ban the state from recognizing same-sex marriages, but further stated, ""Any other relationship shall not be recognized as a marriage or its legal equivalent, nor shall it receive the benefits or incidents exclusive to marriage.""
 
But Romney quickly expressed his opposition to the amendment, saying that although he believed marriage was between a man and a woman, the language barring civil unions was ""too extreme,"" with his spokesman telling the Boston Globe, ""Mitt does not support it. As far as Mitt is concerned, it goes farther than current law, and therefore it's unnecessary.""
 
Yet in 2003, when the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples could be married in the state, Romney urged the legislature to adopt a constitutional amendment banning the practice. He has since supported a similar amendment to the U.S. Constitution, despite the fact that the congressionally proposed constitutional amendment includes language similar to the 2002 Massachusetts ballot proposal that he opposed",True,"October 5, 2007"
