She said this was because the Judiciary had no facilities of its own to accommodate the number of candidates that sat for exams. “The Judiciary would therefore like to take this opportunity to inform the public that it remains committed to the ideals of transparency, accountability and probity and thus remains open to provide verified information to members of the public who may have queries on issues of interest,” said Slavin. Therefore, while it is true that only two passed the aptitude test of the 170 who sat for the test, the test questions were set, administered, and marked by the Judiciary and not ZIALE.",Misleading,"Oct, 24 2022"

In arriving at the conclusion that Dr. Mmemb’s claim was misleading, iVerify Zambia scrutinised
the Anti-Gender-Based Violence Act No 1 of 2011.
According to Part 1 of the Act under the interpretation clause section 3 the definition of gender-based violence includes “violence that results in, or likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to the person, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or private life.”
The act further defines “physical abuse” as “use of physical force against another person, including the forcible confinement or detention of another person and the deprivation of another person of access to adequate food, water, clothing, shelter, rest or subjecting another person to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”
In terms of the number of acts that may amount to gender-based violence, Part 2 of the Act states that a single act may amount to gender-based violence. Based on the Anti-Gender-Based Violence Act No 1 of 2011 Act, the acts of criminality perpetrated against the 13 abducted girls amount to gender based violence.

On the other hand, Article 60 of the Zambian Constitution merely provides guidance on the rights and obligations of political parties in Zambia. However, it does not state that political parties must be deregistered on account of failing to hold a convention or general conference.
In addition, iVerify Zambia consulted Mr. MacDonald Chipenzi, a governance expert and Director at the Governance, Elections, Advocacy, Research Services (GEARS) Initiative, who confirmed that there is no law in Zambia that permits deregistration of a party that has not held a convention to renew tenure of office of its office bearers.

This means that the amount of money a family spends to meet their needs is very high compared to their average income.
The cost of living represents the average cost of an accepted standard of living including basic food items and essential non-food items.

In the Zambian context, the Bemba language proverb/saying “ukuteka amatako panshi” or “teka amatako panshi” simply means “take it easy” or “one should take caution or be careful in their doings”.

","The Fact-Checking Process by iVerify Zambia has established as false the claim in the news article published by Ask Muvi TV Facebook page that the Government of the Republic of Zambia has banned all the New Year’s Events. The news article stemmed from the statement issued by the Provincial Local Government Officer for Southern Province, Mr. Amusa Zaza on 30th December 2021, directing all Town Clerks and Council Secretaries in Southern Province to immediately stop issuing gathering permits to churches and other institutions such as bars, night clubs, markets, and bus stations in their districts until further notice. The statement stated that the directive was due to the high number of Covid-19 cases recorded by the Ministry of Health, and the anticipated public gatherings to celebrate the beginning of the new year would act as super spreaders of the virus.

The size of the resurgence of cases (4th wave) may depend on the following factors;
1. Proportion of unprotected population with no natural or acquired immunity

The article further claimed this was because ministers were failing to articulate on policy positions until they wait on the President’s guidance.

The Constitution further states that the President can exercise those powers directly or through officers subordinate to him. By holding a press briefing and later featuring on a radio programme, the President did not usurp the role of the Chief Government Spokesperson.

140,"Following the death of Zambia’s Chief Justice Ireen Mambilima on 20th June 2021, there has been wide circulation of misinformation and concerns from the general public surrounding the appointment of a new Chief Justice by the President. This was further compounded by the fact that Justice Mambilima died just before the elections which resulted in a change of Government. Zambia Today Facebook page published an article quoting John Sangwa State Council (SC) advising President Hakainde Hichilema to subject the filling in of the vacant position of Chief Justice to a competitive and transparent process before it is taken to Parliament for ratification. This process would include advertising the position and conducting public interviews.","The fact checking process has established the claim by John Sangwa in the article that the position of Zambia Chief Justice can be advertised as misleading. Zambia consists of three arms of Government, namely the Executive, Legislature and Judiciary. The Executive is responsible for the daily administration of enforcing the laws, formulating and implementing policies in the country and is headed by the Republican President. The Legislature is responsible for making laws, repeals, amends and providing other oversight roles and it is headed by the speaker. The Judiciary is responsible for interpreting the laws made by the legislature, and has the power to adjudicate over legal matters and decide on legal disputes through courts. It is created by the Constitution and is headed by the Chief Justice. Following the death of Chief Justice Ireen Mambillima on 20th June 2021, the position has been vacant and is being temporarily headed by deputy chief Justice Michael Musonda. In line with these arms of Government, the principle of separation of powers must be applied. This means that there should be no overlap in the powers and functions of the different arms of Government. It sets limits on the work of the Judiciary, the Legislature and the Executive; and it provides checks and balances that prevent abuse of power by any of the three arms of government. In line with the claim by John Sangwa SC, the current process has lacked semblance of transparency or fairness. The appointment of the Chief Justice by the president has caused a dependence of the Judiciary on the Executive as there is no separation of powers with the Chief Justice (Judiciary) being appointed by the President (Executive). Mr. Sangwa said the consequence of this process has been the emergence of a Judiciary that doesn’t command the respect of the people it is supposed to serve. In response to Mr. Sangwa’s letter, the Law Association of Zambia (LAZ) stated that The Chief Justice of the Republic of Zambia is appointed by the President upon the recommendation of the Judicial Service Commission (JSC), in line with Article 140 of the Constitution of Zambia. According to Article 216 of the Constitution, all Service Commissions, including the JSC, shall be subject only to the Constitution and be independent and not be subject to the control of a person or an authority in the performance of its functions. In this regard, Section 23 of the Service Commissions Act, No. 10 of 2016, permits the JSC to regulate its own procedure. In regulating its procedure, the JSC is at liberty to adopt a more transparent method of scrutiny of candidates before it makes its recommendation to the President. LAZ advised the President to stay clear of the process to be adopted by the JSC in its function of making recommendations to him. Furthermore, the Chief Justice of the Republic of Zambia is appointed by the President upon the recommendation of the Judicial Service Commission (JSC), therefore, it is not an independent decision by the President.",Misleading,"Oct, 27 2021"

One such claim is contained in a video posted by the Patriotic Front page on 20th September 2021, where an unknown man was captured using a phone to record the “impounded” fuel tankers at an area with other unknown men. One of the men is seen wearing a red hoody with the letters HH behind the hoody. Another man is heard speaking in a Zambian local language stating that these are government vehicles and they (referring to him and the other men) went to pick them because they were hidden.

The post further claimed the government was spending money without the accounting officers, the role played by permanent secretaries. The claim was further amplified by National Democratic Congress (NDC) leader Saboi Imboela a few days later, when she stated during a special Interview on Muvi TV, that because President Hichilema “has fired all Permanent Secretaries at the same time… there are no controlling officers in the ministries, they are not signing any cheques…payments are not coming out”.","The fact checking process has determined as false the claim that the Government is running illegally and spending public resources without Permanent Secretaries, who are the accounting officers for government ministries.  After the inauguration of President Hakainde Hichilema, the government retired some Permanent Secretaries but some maintained their positions. Where a permanent secretary is relieved of his or her duties, or if they leave the office to attend to other work related issues or even get a vocational leave, someone is appointed to carry out their duties in an acting capacity. The Acting Permanent Secretary performs all the duties without compromise. In a case where a Permanent Secretary is fired, the Secretary to the Cabinet automatically moves in to perform controlling officer duties in that Ministry, and in most cases the directors are given the opportunity to act as Permanent Secretaries because they are the immediate juniors to the permanent secretaries, all this is conveniently done in the process pending the appointment of a new permanent secretary. The Constitution of Zambia, Act No. 2 of 2016, states in Article 176 that “a person qualifies to be appointed as Secretary to the Cabinet if that person has or had at least ten years’ experience as permanent secretary or equivalent rank.” This “Act” simply clarifies why the secretary to the cabinet automatically resumes duties.

The article asserted that the cadres from the ruling UPND broke into the Andrich Coach Services offices and looted property and luggages belonging to passengers.","The fact checking process has determined as unproven the claim that UPND cadres have banned buses belonging to PF Eastern Province Chairperson, and Chipangali MP, Mr. Andrew Lubusha from operating at Intercity Bus Terminus in Lusaka since the day PF lost the 12th August, 2021 elections. While a check at intercity bus terminus by iVerify and a Press Release from Andrich Freight Company Limited confirmed that Andrich Bus Coaches was non-operational, various bus conductors contacted by iVerify could not offer sufficient evidence to link the ban of Andrich buses from operating at Intercity Buses Terminus to the UPND. In a separate phone call by iVerify to UPND youth chairperson, Mr. Anderson Banda, he highlighted that no UPND cadres were running operations at the Intercity Bus Terminus as the Lusaka City Council were managing bus stations and markets in the city. Another phone call made by iVerify to Lusaka City Council Public Relations Desk, could not substantiate the claim that UPND cadres have banned buses belonging to Andrich bus stations from operating at Intercity Bus Terminus in Lusaka.

158,"In an article published on their Facebook page, Smart Eagles claimed that the large number of petitions on the results of the August 12th General Elections have put President Hakainde Hichilema and the UPND victory under self-sabotage, and question the integrity of various election observer missions. According to Smart Eagles, petitioning raised questions on the integrity of the African Union Election Observation Mission, the European Union Election Observation Mission, the Commonwealth Observers, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) observers and the rest who declared the elections free and fair. They add that because of the integrity of these organizations, Zambia has UPND as a ruling party today and because of the integrity of these organizations, the former President opted not to pursue his claim that the August 12 election was not free and fair. In their report, Smart Eagles claim that hearing that over half of the total number of MPs have petitioned the outcome of the just ended election in Zambia will negatively change the world perception of Zambia democracy and discourage investors. The claim by the Smart Eagles has led to speculations involving misinformation that has the potential to cause many Zambians to lose confidence in the constitutional processes and credibility of international organizations election observer organizations.","The fact checking process has determined as false the claim by Smart Eagles that election petitions have put President Hakainde Hichilema and the UPND victory under self-sabotage. An election petition is a procedure for inquiring into the validity of the election results of Parliamentary or local government elections. According to the laws of Zambia it is a constitutional right, meaning an election petition is under law to challenge the election of a candidate in a Parliamentary, Assembly or local election. Therefore according to article 73 (1) of the Constitution of Zambia, a person may file an election petition with the High Court to challenge the election of a Member of Parliament, which the UPND and any aggrieved party that participated in the just ended general election is at liberty to contest if they are displeased with the outcome of elections, regardless of their political affiliation but rather, based on their constitutional right as is guided. The fact checking process has further established that petitioning results is not questioning the integrity of election observer missions and the rest who declared the election free and fair as is being claimed by Smart Eagles. In an observation of these reports by the international organizations, all made mention of the election as technically managed but marred with unequal campaign conditions, restrictions on freedom of assembly and movement and abuse of incumbency, among other observations. Corroborating this observation by these organizations with one of the many similar grounds of petitioning, UPND’s Bernard Kanengo petitioned Bowman Lusambo’s victory in Kabushi Constituency. In his petition Mr Kanengo makes claims that the election was marred with corrupt and bribery practices. These alleged unequal campaign conditions are the reason and justification for the petition, and if not addressed, are what actually undermine the integrity of the electoral process. In his petition, the concerns raised by Mr Kanengo are in line with the observations that were made by the international organizations. It can therefore be stated that the overwhelming number of petitions by the UPND, opposition and independent losing candidates does not undermine the integrity of the international election observers but instead shows an exercise of democratic rights and freedoms in Zambia that may have been facilitated by the international observers’ presence.",False,"Oct, 08 2021"

Following this event, the Patriotic Front Facebook page published an article with a press statement from the Zambia Information and Communication Technology Authority (ZICTA) stating that the authority does not know what caused internet intermittent failure, and they could not speculate or comment.","The fact checking process has determined as misleading the claim by the Patriotic Front that the Zambia Information and Communication Technology Authority (ZICTA) had commented that the authority did not know what caused internet failure during elections. As a regulatory body responsible for the ICT Sector in Zambia, ZICTA is mandated to regulate the provision of electronic communication services and products in Zambia; provide for a national frequency and numbering plan; and protect the rights and interests of consumers, service providers, suppliers, and manufacturers. Going by these guidelines, the Chapter One Foundation commenced legal proceedings against ZICTA, under Case Number 2021/HP/0955 for the court to make a determination regarding, among others, the cause of the said intermittent internet availability on the 12th and 13th of August 2021. Contained in the letter by ZICTA that was shared by the Patriotic Front in the article on Facebook, the Authority stated that it was aware of the intermittent internet availability which resulted in unavailability of some services from August 12 to 13, 2021. ZICTA further mad reference to the active court case with the Chapter One Foundation and makes emphasis that due to the court action, the Authority is constrained to comment on the matter. In accordance with the statement by ZICTA, the fact checking process has taken into consideration the aspect of contempt of court, which is the offense of being disobedient to or disrespectful toward a court of law and its officers in the form of behavior that opposes or defies the authority, justice, and dignity of the court. During court proceedings, an individual or the parties involved are restricted from giving out or commenting on any issues that are actively on going as this has the potential to jeopardize the credibility and ruling of the court. It is under this guidance that ZICTA clearly stated in the letter that the authority is constrained to comment on the matter. While it is true that ZICTA could not speculate or comment on the internet shut down on the 12th and 13th of August 2021, the claim by the PF is misleading as the PF misquoted the authority.

Of these cases, 55 were of high public interest as they involved politically exposed persons (PEPs). Ms Chibwe added that the 55 high-profile cases included that of a former Ward Councilor of Lusaka being investigated for suspicious purchase of a bank and its assets worth K300 million.

Mrs. Katongo said the incident occurred on the 7th of September at Intercity bus terminus and the suspects are detained for obtaining money by false pre-tenses and will appear in court soon. The receipt branded with UPND details cannot prove beyond reasonable doubt that the individuals collecting money are UPND cadres as anyone is at liberty to print on receipts the details of any political party, therefore as guided by the police, the affiliation of the individuals to a political party will only be fully determined when they appear in court.

She further claimed that President Hakainde Hichilema wanted to govern the country without following the law.","The fact checking process has determined the claim by Ms. Nawakwi as false. Appointments to Cabinet are guided by the Constitution of Zambia which under Article 68 provides clear guidance on the election of Members of Parliament to the National Assembly. The Article states that a Member of Parliament shall either be elected by the people or nominated by the President. Accordingly, Dr. Situmbeko Musokotwane qualifies to be a Member of the National Assembly because he was elected as Member of Parliament for Liuwa constituency in the 12th August  2021 General Elections under the United Party for National Development (UPND) party. Article 116 of the Constitution gives further guidance to the effect that (1) The President shall appoint a prescribed number of Members of Parliament as Ministers and (2) A Minister shall be responsible, under the direction of the President, for the policy and strategic direction of a Ministry, a department or other State institution as assigned by the President. This article in essence indicates that the President acted within his jurisdiction in appointing Dr. Musokotwane as Minister of Finance. In accordance with Part (2) of Article 116 of the Constitution,  President Hakainde Hichilema swore in Dr. Musokotwane on 27th August 2021 and tasked him to address various economic issues in the country. This part of the Constitution invalidates the claim by Ms. Nawakwi that the President did not act within the law when appointing the Minister.

Mr. Sangwa said that President Hichilema did not breach the law by appointing Dr. Musokotwane and that the Minister was not illegally in office before taking oath as MP. He stated that there was no Constitutional provision that requires the elected Member of Parliament to be sworn in before being appointed Minister and taking oath was just a formality before assuming public office.

The Zambia Whistleblower article quoted civil rights activist Mr. Brebner Changala, who encouraged the ZRA to close Airtel for non-compliance with tax requirements. Mr Changala said this would also help ZRA to prove that the closure of the Post Newspapers was not political. The report further claimed that Airtel committed a criminal offence, and the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) should take interest as they may have falsified some figures for seven years. The Zambia Whistleblower alludes that prior to their post, ZRA sent a demand notice of K580milion to Airtel for unpaid and Airtel has been asked to pay within five working days.","The fact-checking process has determined as false the claim that Airtel Networks Zambia Plc has not been paying taxes amounting to K580 million to the Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) for seven years.

The statement states that Airtel has discharged and has continued to discharge all its statutory liabilities on time and all financial statements of the company are in the public domain by virtue of it been listed in the Lusaka Stock Exchange. The Zambia Revenue Authority also issued a statement on their official Facebook page urging the general public to ignore the fake story circulating on social media about Airtel which they stated is aimed at discrediting the revenue performance of the Authority. ZRA stated that contrary to the reports, they had not written to Airtel Networks Zambia requesting the company to settle taxes because it has clear channels of engaging all its taxpayers regarding any tax liabilities.

Mr Mwanza further alluded to the fact that Madam Scotland and the Commonwealth are the ones who facilitated the peace accord that was signed at Mulungushi International Conference Centre. He questioned the position of the Commonwealth in view of what he said was the continued abrogation of the peace pledge by the UPND, and demanded that Ms Scotland, tell the Zambian people if she and the Commonwealth were endorsing violence by the UPND. Mr Mwanza also challenged Fr Chikoya to state the Church position on the continued violence by UPND.","The fact checking process has determined as false, allegations that the Commonwealth is biased and that the intergovernmental body facilitated the peace and nonviolence accord meeting organized by the Coalition for Peaceful Elections in Zambia. The claims followed the Coalition for Peaceful Elections in Zambia’s launch of an initiative encouraging political party leaders and candidates in the 12th August 2021 elections to commit to peaceful elections by signing a peace pledge and making a joint public commitment reaffirming non-violence and a credible electoral process. Contrary to what the article says that the commonwealth facilitated the peace and nonviolence accord meeting, the initiative was organized and facilitated by Zambian organisations, and supported by the Commonwealth secretariat, as indicated on this link on the Commonwealth website.

Mr. Mwanza said Mr. Jackson Kungo was murdered by UPND cadres who descended on him at a polling station in Solwezi as he took voter registers to the PF polling agents at the polling station. He added that all political parties are required by ECZ to buy and provide voter registers to their polling agents.","The fact checking process has established as inconclusive the claim by Mr. Mwanza that PF North Western Provincial Chairperson Mr. Jackson Kungo had been murdered by UPND cadres. While the death of Mr. Kungo was confirmed by the Police and other stakeholders, the fact checking process could not find any verifiable evidence that Mr Kungo was killed by UPND cadres and that he was delivering voter registers. In a statement on 12th August 2021, President Edgar Chagwa Lungu confirmed that PF Chairman Jackson Kungo died in the afternoon of 12th August 2021. The PF said at the time of his attack, Mr Kungo had been sent to distribute voter registers to the PF monitors at Kyawama polling station in Solwezi. However, contrary to that statement, the Northwestern Province Police Commissioner stated that Mr. Kungo went to vote at Kyawama polling station when it was suspected that he was carrying pre-marked ballot papers, before the residents pounced on him. A call with a polling monitor further disputes this allegation by the police that Mr Kungo was set to vote at Kyawama polling station as he was not registered to vote from there. There are therefor three different versions of Mr. Kungo’s presence at the polling station. iVerify cannot confirm that the group of voters are UPND cadres or affiliated to UPND or any other political party because there is no proof that the alleged mob was dressed in UPND regalia nor identified themselves as such. An analysis carried out by iVerify shows that one of the polling day offences by the Electoral Commission of Zambia (ECZ) includes putting up a political notice or sign or being clad in political regalia within a radius of 100 meters of a polling station during polling day. It would therefore render it difficult or close to impossible to have an individual in political regalia at a polling station.

He claimed that from the time he lodged his nomination on July 12, 2021, he had received threats targeting his life and his close associates. He stated that the unprecedented levels of electoral violence in the Constituency also contributed to his decision to withdraw from the race. He stated regret in the inconvenience the step would bring to the commission, supporters and the other stakeholders. However, according to him, he had no other option but to stand down.","The fact finding process has established as true the claim by Mr Chabala that he had withdrawn his candidature for Mandevu Constituency, and his reasons for withdrawing.

He said the major reason for his withdrawal were the threats he received. Mr Chabala mentioned that the playing field was uneven and it favored a few candidates who were able to campaign freely and safely whilst disadvantaging others, inclusive of him. In responding to allegations made by Zambia Reports concerning political violence, Mr Chabala confirmed that there was indeed violence in Mandevu but he however did not state any political party inciting it. A further analysis by iVerify showed that various stakeholders such as the Patriots for Economic Progress Party (PEP) condemned the destruction of property and assault on innocent citizens caused by unsuspecting party members in Mandevu constituency in Lusaka. Southern African Centre for the Constructive Resolution of Disputes (SACCORD) Executive Director Boniface Cheembe also added that democratic processes premised on violence would not help Zambians make an informed decision in terms of which party to vote for and condemned the violence in Mandevu. In addition to this, Inspector General of police Mr Kakoma Kanganja stated that the police have time and again advised political parties to ensure that they conduct themselves peacefully and within the confines of the law during their public activities as well as when other political parties undertake their activities.

Similarly, the conduct of some UPND cadres who were alleged to have damaged motor vehicles during their roadshow was criminal and prosecutable. He therefore directed Lusaka Province Police Command to ensure that all those involved in the confusion and criminal acts during the UPND roadshow in Mandevu were arrested and prosecuted.

The publication stated that the Government, through the Ministry of Health, is encouraging mothers who test positive to COVID-19 to continue breast feeding their babies as long as preventive measures such as masking up by the infected mother as well as hand hygiene are followed to minimise transmission to the baby. The article reported that Dr. Malama said this during the commemoration of this year’s World Breastfeeding Week that falls from the 1st to 7th August, under the theme “Protect breastfeeding, a shared responsibility.” Dr. Malama, in the report noted that this years theme was timely as latest statistics from the Zambia Demographic Health Survey of 2018 showed a drop in the rate of breastfeeding in the country from 73 per cent in 2014 to 70 per cent in 2018. Dr. Malama noted that the objectives of the World Breastfeeding Week were to inform, anchor, engage and galvanize effects around prtecting, promoting and supporting breastfeeding.","The Fact Checking process has determined as true the claims by the Ministry of Health Permanent Secretary, Dr. Kennedy Malama, that it is safe for breastfeeding mothers infected with COVID-19 to breast feed their babies. Aside the prescribed precautions established by the Ministry of Health, such as masking up as well as hand hygiene during breast feeding, the iVerify Fact checking team further investigated various credible health research institutions to reinenforce the claim through various reports investigated to establish as true, that infected mothers can safely breast feed their babies as Coronavirus has not been found in breast milk. According to a 2020 scientific Brief by the World Health Organization (WHO), titled ‘Breastfeeding and COVID-19,’ a total of 46 mother-infant dyads had breastmilk samples tested from COVID-19 positive mothers. Breastmilk samples from 43 mothers were negative for the COVID-19 virus, while samples from 3 mothers tested positive for viral particles by RT-PCR. Among the 3 infants whose mothers’ breastmilk tested positive for virual RNA particles, not live virus, one infant tested positive for COVID-19 but infant feeding practices were not reported, a scientific trend that shows that breastmilk from a COVID-19 positive mother is safe as no COVID-19 has been detected. Another reference report investigated from the United Nations Children’s Emergence Fund (UNICEF) show that so far, the COVID-19 virus has not been found in breast milk and all mothers are advised to continue breastfeeding, while practicing good hygiene during feeding, which include Wear a mask during feeding,Wash hands with soap before and after touching the baby, Wipe and disinfect surfaces regularly.

Further verification showed that the Electoral Commission of Zambia has scheduled dates of distribution of ballot boxes which could not have facilitated the availability of the ballot boxes at Lusaka’s Civic Centre on the 6th of August as they are scheduled to be at Lusaka’s Civic Centre on the 9th of August. In fact, in a statement shared on their official facebook page, the ECZ through the District Electoral Officer Mr. Alex Mwansa confirmed that ballot papers are yet to be distributed in Lusaka, adding that according to the Electoral Commission of Zambia timetable, the distribution of ballot papers in Lusaka will take place on the 9th August 2021. Mr. Mwansa invited all stake holders to witness the distribution process of the ballot papers; calling on members of the public to desist from spreading falsehoods but rather seek clarity when they encounter information they deem suspicious.

While the directive counts for all political party candidates, it is important to note that in a live phone interview on Diamond TV’s Breakfast show that was broadcast on 28th July, 2021, Zambia Police spokesperson Esther Katongo said the Police regulation of activities does not apply to the Republican President and the Republican Vice President. According to Ms Katongo, the President and Vice President are exempted because they are not subject to the provisions of the Public Order Act and therefore, all politicians whether from the ruling party or the opposition should not emulate what the Head of State is doing, which is distribution of face masks. The statement is backed up by the Law of Zambia on Regulation of Assemblies, Public meetings and Processions, the Public Order Act Chapter 5 Subsection 6, which states that the provisions of subsections (4) and (5) shall not apply to any public meeting convened by or at the request of and intended to be addressed by the President, the Vice-President or any Minister or Junior Minister or the Speaker or Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly. In summary, the iVerify team considers the claim that Mr. Hichilema has consistently been stopped from campaigning by the President as misleading given that the current restrictions in place count for all political parties and leaders, with the exception of the President as per the Constitution. In addition, the restrictions have been implemented and enforced by independent government institutions.",Misleading,"Aug, 04 2021"
190,"Lawyer and politician Mr. Sakwiba Sikota SC (State Counsel), was quoted by the Smart Eagles Facebook page stating that the Electoral Commission of Zambia’s (ECZ) guidance relating to independent candidates’ affiliation to political parties was wrong. In response, the ECZ issued a statement reminding all independent candidates for the forthcoming General Election that independent candidates should not be affiliated to any political party. In line with the legal requirements, all independent candidates should have relinquished political party membership “at least two months immediately before the date of the election.” To this end, independent candidates were advised to desist from using campaign materials for political parties or in any way identify themselves with any political party. In case of a breach, the Commission promised to take appropriate action including disqualification of erring candidates. The article further states that according to Mr. Sikota, if ECZ is to bar any of the independents, who have relinquished party membership, for encouraging their supporters to show their liking of a political party’s presidential candidate, they may find themselves sued. He cited Articles 20 (Freedom of Expression) and article 21(Freedom of Assembly and Association) of the constitution of Zambia to prove that independent candidates have the right to participate and have an effect on the election. In what he refers to as the Livingstone 2006 effect, Mr. Sikota, an eminent lawyer in Zambia of nearly forty years standing at the bar and experienced in both civil and criminal litigation, claims that he was on the same campaign platforms as other political party leaders who would be clad in their own regalia whilst he was always in United Liberal Party (ULP) campaign material. He further alludes that in 2008 and 2011 he enjoyed his rights under Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution and no one, including the Electoral Commission of Zambia, suggested in 2008 that he had been in breach and should lose his seat. He adds that the protections given under articles 20 and 21 cannot be diluted by other provisions of the Constitution or acts of parliament as they are entrenched rights « rights which are explicitly protected by the Constitution, they have a special status and are immune from change by political whims through legislation. In order to change them, a Constitutional Amendment is required »","The claim by Mr. Sakwiba Sikota that ECZ guidance to independent candidates is wrong, as reported on Smart Eagles, is inconclusive. An observation made by iVerify showed that the statement made by ECZ is a word for word quote of the Constitution of Zambia. The ECZ further goes on to interpret this guidance of independent candidates to necessary stakeholders. In reference to article 20 which states, “(1) except with his own consent, no person shall be hindered in the enjoyment of his freedom of expression, that is to say, freedom to hold opinions without interference, freedom to receive ideas and information without interference, freedom to impart and communicate ideas and information without interference, whether the communication be to the public generally or to any person or class of persons, and freedom from interference with his correspondence”, the statement by ECZ does not stop independent candidates from holding opinions or enjoying their freedom of expression. The statement by ECZ in turn advises independent candidates to desist from using campaign materials for political parties or in any way identify themselves with any political party as they are contesting based on independent candidacy. Furthermore, in relation to article 21 of the constitution of Zambia on freedom of assembly and association, which states that “except with his own consent, no person shall be hindered in the enjoyment of his freedom of assembly and association, that is to say, his right to assemble freely and associate with other persons and in particular to form or belong to any political party, trade union or other association for the protection of his interests”, the statement by ECZ again does not stop independent candidates from assembling or associating. Instead, the statement warns against “affiliation” which is as guided by the Zambian Constitution. Another observation made by the iVerify team relates to the fact that Mr. Sakwiba Sikota says to have been running under the United Liberial Party for the 2006 Livingstone Parliamentary Race, while in 2008 and 2011, he was on the same campaign platform as Rupiah Banda all around the country. Rupiah Banda would wear the Movement for Multipary Democracy (MMD) attire and Mr Sikota would adorn himself in the ULP campaign regalia. This observation implies that Mr. Sikota did not contest as an independent candidate but under the United Liberal Party, therefore not breaching any law as this article of independent candidates in the Zambian constitution as well as ECZ’s recent statement does not apply to him. The example he gave in the article can therefore be considered misleading to independent candidates. However, in a call made by iVerify to Mr. Sakwiba Sikota, he stated that he disagreed with the guidelines issued by ECZ, arguing that the ECZ statement is not supported by the Constitution. According to him, articles 20 and 21 of the Zambia Constitution are included in part 3, which make them supreme over other parts of the constitution as they are entrenched provisions. He continued that, even if there was an article amended in the constitution which then would touch upon the rights which are protected in part 3, those amended articles would not have an effect because part 3 can only be changed after a referendum and other requirements. Therefore, in the event that ECZ was to disqualify candidates, Mr. Sikota stated that candidates would be able to sue on the basis of articles 20 and 21. He emphasized that the Constitution cannot contradict itself; the Constitution incorporates a self-correcting mechanism as part 3 overrides seemingly contradictory positions, thus ensuring that there is no contradiction in the constitution. In conclusion, iVerify rates this justification as inconclusive as it is ultimately up to the courts of law to determine whether the statement issued by ECZ is is in line with the Constitution or contradictory and infringing on entrenched rights.",Unproven,"Jul, 28 2021"

In addition, News Diggers alludes that according to the FIC annual report of 2020, the most prominent offences observed include tax evasion and corruption.","The process of fact finding has established the depiction of corruption in Zambia by the FIC to be true. As presented on page 15 of the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) report, the number of reports received amount to 14, with a total value of K2,228,000,000 lost to corruption, followed by tax evasion amounting to K717 million. Corruption is cited as accounting for the majority, according to News Diggers. In comparison with records of 2019, when the report recorded a value of K332 million with only 4 reports, this years’ report indicates an increased rate of corruption following an increase in reports of 350% and with corruption alone accounting for K2.2 billion of the money lost. The iVerify fact checkers also took into consideration the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) by Transparency International (TI), a global civil society organization leading the fight against corruption around the world. According to this index, a country or territory’s score indicates the corruption level as perceived by the public on a scale of 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean). In this report, Zambia had been ranked at 33 in 2020, while Zambia scored 34 in 2019 and 35 in 2018; alluding to an increased level of corruption. The index also ranks 180 countries and territories by their perceived levels of public sector corruption. Zambia has for the past three years seen its ranking position in this index worsen from 105 in 2018, 113 in 2019 and 117 in 2020. Conclusively, iVerify has corroborated through these reports that the FIC’s depiction of corruption in the country is true, while TI reports for the last three years show that the corruption perception in the country keeps deteriorating.",True,"Jul, 27 2021"

Mr Kamba asserts that the PF ensure Zambians continue to enjoy human rights and fundamental freedoms of expression without fear or favor and the party cautions all citizens regardless of political affiliation against violence. He stated that the intention of the report by Amnesty was to cause harm and unfair prejudice against the PF.","The fact finding process has established as false the claim that Amnesty International is maliciously targeting the ruling party.

On its website, Amnesty International publicly shares information that shows that the organization works independently to promote human rights, ensuring that those in power keep their promises, respect international law and are held to account. Amnesty International says its mandate is to hold the government of the day accountable and not any opposition political party that may have incited any violations because the government has the sole responsibility of ensuring the wellbeing of every Zambian. The recommendations on page 8 of the AI report throughout the rest of the report makes reference to the government of Zambia and relevant authorities, not the ruling party.

206,"On 13th October, 2021, The Candidates uploaded a post that claimed there is no law in Zambia that mandates its citizenry to display a Presidential portrait in business or office premises, as only Government institutions are mandated to. This claim followed an incident where a Debonairs outlet in Choma district was shut down by alleged UPND cadres for failure to display a Presidential portrait.","The Fact Checking process has determined as true the claim that there is no law in Zambia that mandates its citizenry to display a Presidential portrait in business or office premises, as only Government institutions are mandated. Following an incident in which a Debonairs outlet in Choma district was shut down by alleged UPND cadres for failure to display a Presidential portrait, iVerify critically examined various statutory documents including the Constitution of Zambia, the Local Government Act of Zambia and the Penal Code Act of Zambia, and confirmed that there is no statutory provision mandating anyone to display the Presidential portrait in business or office premises.",True,"Oct, 20 2021"
207,"On 28th July 2021, News Diggers Newspaper published an article in relation to statements made by the Patriotic Front (PF) party Secretary General, Mr. Davis Mwila claiming that the Police had been infiltrated by the opposition United Party for National Development (UPND). Mr. Mwila stated that the Police did not act when the Patriotic Front members were attacked by the UPND; instructing the Party members to defend themselves when attacked while threatening to suspend members of the Party who fail to act as guided.","The fact checking process has determined as misleading the claim made by the Patriotic Front (PF) Secretary General, Mr. Davies Mwila that the Police had been infiltrated by the opposition party UPND, citing the unwillingness of the Police to act when PF members are attacked as justification. In order to verify the claim, the iVerify fact checking team contacted the Police Deputy Spokesperson, Mr Mwale, to hear his side of the story. Mr. Mwale refuted the allegations, stating that the Police acts irrespective of the party under attack. In response, the iVerify team went on to look for examples that could substantiate the claim made by the Police Deputy Spokesperson, leading the team to analyse several instances where supporters of the UPND had been arrested by Police for political offenses. For example, on 18th July 2021, Lusaka Times reported that six United Party for National Development (UPND) cadres had been arrested by the police in Solwezi district for conduct “likely to cause breach of the peace”. UPND supporters were arrested in Solwezi following their clashes with their PF counterparts. In a phone interview with the iVerify team, Northwestern Province Commissioner of Police, Mr. Joel Njase confirmed the arrest of the UPND supporters. In another case investigated by iVerify, Police in Ikelenge District were reported to have arrested 19 suspected UPND cadres for riotous behavior and for assaulting a journalist from state owned Zambia News and Information Services (ZANIS). On 26th July 2021, the iVerify team phoned the victim, Mr. Victor Mwila, the ZANIS journalist, who confirmed that he was indeed attacked by political party cadres. Mr. Mwila added that he was certain that the people who attacked him were UPND cadres because they were dressed in UPND party regalia. The fact checking team contacted the Northwestern province Police Commissioner, Mr. Joel Njase who affirmed that the police had arrested UPND cadres. Given that the iVerify team was able to find substantial evidence that the Police has both arrested PF as well as UPND party members, it has determined as misleading the claim made by the Patriotic Front (PF) Secretary General that the Police is unwilling to act when PF members are attacked.",Misleading,"Aug, 04 2021"
208,"The Patriotic Front (PF) Facebook Page published an article on 3rd November 2021 claiming that Kabwata Constituency Member of Parliament, Honorable Levy Mkandawire had died. The PF Facebook page based its claim on unknown reports.","The Fact Checking Process has determined as false the claim that Hon. Levy Mkandawire had died on 3rd November 2021 after a short illness.
United Party for National Development (UPND) Information and Publicity Secretary for Kabwata Constituency, Mainda Simataa released a Press Statement during the late hours of 3rd November 2021 stating that Hon. Mkandawire was alive and in good health. According to the statement, articles published on various Facebook pages about Hon. Mkandawire’s purported death were not true as the Member of Parliament had confirmed through a phone call that he was alive and had not been ill.
In addition, the UPND official Facebook page published an audio recording with Hon. Mkandawire’s picture as proof that the MP was alive. In the audio, Hon. Mkandawire introduces himself and explains that the information circulating on social media about his death was fake news.
As part of its verification process, the iVerify Team had a phone interview with Hon. Levy M’kandawire who explained that when the fake news was published on the PF Facebook Page, he received a lot of calls about the story. He said the news disturbed him as he did not understand why a media house would create such fake news that has a negative impact on his life, family, and career. He urged media houses to verify information and avoid publishing falsehoods because these have serious negative impacts on people affected.

Furthermore, the UPND Deputy Youth Chairperson of Lusaka, Mr Antony Zimba denied the accusations, telling the iVerify fact checkers “there is no evidence to prove that the UPND youths are the ones who attacked the motorists”.

The report further quotes the UPND Elections Chairperson Mr. Garry Nkombo stated that “the Visa for the UPND representative Mr. Richard Njolomba which unfortunately was rejected as he needed a Government to Government consented Visa which could only be gotten through the Elections body”. Mr. Nkombo further stated in the Facebook video that “he felt the nullification of the Visa was a deliberate ploy by the officers in the offices that are controlling the process”. As a result of Mr Njolomba’s failure to travel, Mr Nkombo said the UPND had sent an alternative party representative based in London to monitor the printing of ballot papers in Dubai.","The Fact Checking process determined as false the claim that the UPND representative Mr. Njolomba’s failure to obtain a visa was because of the ECZ, part of “…a deliberate ploy by the officers in the offices that are controlling the process”. The fact checking process corroborated evidence from different actors involved in the matter, and determined that Mr Njolomba’s Visa could not be approved due to the failure to provide a travel Covid19 clearance certificate. On the 16th June 2021, The ECZ made a publication on the monitoring of printing of ballot papers by stakeholders for the 2021 General Elections, giving guidance on the requirements to be met by representatives from political parties to secure their travel. The statement clarified that the Commission does not facilitate travelling documents, and that representatives needed to obtain a Covid 19 clearance certificate from approved medical institutions at least 48hrs before travel. This is in accordance to the suspension of travelers from Zambia as part of efforts to contain the spread of Coronavirus by the United Arab Emirates (UAE). On the 5th July 2021, the ECZ issued a media statement announcing the commencement of ballot printing. In the same announcement the ECZ revealed that only the Patriotic Front (PF) had managed to send a representative as other political parties were expected to join the team.",False,"Jul, 20 2021"
