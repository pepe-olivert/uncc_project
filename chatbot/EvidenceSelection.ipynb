        " 'While the death of Mr. Kungo was confirmed by the Police and other stakeholders, the fact checking process could not find any verifiable evidence that Mr Kungo was killed by UPND cadres and that he was delivering voter registers.',\n",

According to Ms. Chirwa, DEC investigations revealed that property No. LUS/38478 was owned by Mr. Charles Phiri, and not Mr. Lungu as had been previously declared. Although DEC had issued the seizure notice in President Lungu’s name, she said that the verification process had shown and confirmed that the property in question actually belonged to Mr. Phiri.
