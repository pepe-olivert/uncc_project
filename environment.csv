"""The laws governing Agenda 2030 land development allows the government to seize polluted lands and move their residents to … smart cities.”","A U.N. resolution passed in 2015 and an urban-planning concept embraced by the World Economic Forum are being twisted on social media into a baseless dystopian plot by the government to track citizens. If that weren’t enough conspiracy theories, this plot insinuates that the Feb. 3 train derailment and toxic chemical burn in East Palestine, Ohio, may be the start of it all. ""The laws governing Agenda 2030 land development allows the government to seize polluted lands and move their residents to … smart cities,"" a woman said in a Feb. 20 video shared on Instagram. ""If you’re living somewhere where your land and water is poisoned, you don’t get an option to opt out. Hmmm, where has land and water been poisoned recently?"" The woman described smart cities as places where the government will track citizens’ personal habits and limit their movements in real time, using a digital ID. We found multiple posts on Instagram and Twitter making the claim following the Ohio incident.  National Transportation Safety Board investigators, although not reaching a formal conclusion in a preliminary report released Feb. 23, cited an overheated wheel bearing discovered just before the derailment. An NTSB spokesperson told PolitiFact there was no sign of foul play or sabotage in the derailment. There are no laws established in the U.N. resolution, only a series of goals member states pledged to try to achieve by 2030. Meanwhile, smart cities are simply an urban planning concept in which technology is used to help the city, and residents’ lives, run more efficiently. In December 2015, all U.N. member states adopted a resolution called the ""2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development."" The U.N. described the plan as a ""shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet."" It  laid out 17 development goals around poverty, inequality and climate change to achieve by 2030. Nothing in the resolution or the stated goals talks about the government seizing polluted land and forcing displaced residents to live in a ""smart city."" The development goals are not legally binding, and countries are responsible for administering their own policies, using the U.N. goals as a guide, according to a U.N. website. Florencia Soto Niño, a U.N. spokesperson, told The Associated Press that although Agenda 2030 talks about improving waste management and air quality, ""at no point does it talk about removing people from their land, even if this is polluted."" ""The claim that the U.N., which has no power anyway, wants to force victims of environmental disasters to live in panopticon societies is absurd on its face,"" said Robert Olshansky, professor emeritus in the Department of Urban & Regional Planning at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  Olshansky said it’s possible for governments to prevent people from living somewhere if it’s not safe, such as in parts of Fukushima, Japan, after the 2011 nuclear plant failure, and give them help to live elsewhere, but not to force them to stay somewhere.  ""The only equivalent I can think of would be the reeducation camps in Xinjiang,"" he said, referring to detention facilities in China the Council on Foreign Relations said house 800,000 to 2 million Uyghurs and other Muslims.  The term ""smart cities"" is also not mentioned in U.N. Agenda 2030, though it has been mentioned in other U.N. initiatives. The speaker in the Instagram video said that the ""smart"" in smart cities is an acronym for ""surveillance monitoring analysis reporting technology,"" but fact-checkers at Agence France-Presse reported this month that is not the case. The ""smart cities"" concept generally refers to cities that use technology to collect information to help make cities run more efficiently. That can happen in a number of ways, such as by improving traffic flow, tracking gunshots to help fight crime or tracking air quality. Karen Lightman, the executive director of Metro21: Smart Cities Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, said there is no universal definition of a smart city, and a wide variety of interpretations. ""Some think it’s all about the tech, some think it’s about the people,"" Lightman said. ""I like to look at it more holistically — it's about the community and people and addressing their challenges and problems through collaborative applications of technology, while ensuring that there are policies in place to protect privacy and security — with the overall goal of improving quality of life, equitably and inclusively."" Lightman said there’s no truth to the claim that governments of smart cities could track or restrict the travel of residents, as the Instagram post claims. ""It seems impossible given current technologies and policies in the U.S.,"" she said. In addition to the smart-city concept, some cities in recent years have embraced the idea of creating neighborhoods in which residents can find everything they need within a 15- or 20-minute trip, thus reducing carbon emissions. Lightman said the posts appear to be confusing the two concepts. The World Economic Forum, as referred to in the Instagram video, said on its website that 36 cities worldwide were chosen to ""pioneer a new global policy roadmap for smart cities developed by the G20 Global Smart Cities Alliance."" The World Economic Forum said the road map will help cities adopt policies to ensure privacy protection for residents, among other things. Among that initial group in the U.S. are San Jose, California, and Chattanooga, Tennessee. Dallas and Pittsburgh have since joined the cities partnering with the alliance. An Instagram post claimed that laws governing the U.N. Agenda 2030 land development allows the government to seize polluted lands and forcibly move residents to smart cities, where their habits and movements will be tracked and limited. The U.N.’s Agenda 2030 is a 2015 resolution containing goals for member states to strive to achieve by 2030, ranging from reducing poverty and hunger to protecting the climate. The U.N. has no power to set laws in countries, which would try to achieve those goals by setting their own policies. There is no mention in the U.N. document or list of goals about seizing polluted land or moving people to smart cities",False,"February 24, 2023"
"Earthquake in Turkey and Syria is ""a systemic attack against Kurdish people.""","The 7.8-magnitude temblor that killed more than 20,000 people in Turkey and Syria was no earthquake, but an orchestrated attack on Kurdish people, an Instagram user claimed. ""According to a firsthand source I have in Istanbul, Turkey, this ‘earthquake’ is a systemic attack against Kurdish people, who are anti-Islam,"" read the post, published Feb. 6, the day of the earthquake.  Explaining the theory, the post claimed that the Kurds are anti-Islam, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan doesn’t want to lose power in an election year and that cities hit by the quake are Kurdish areas. The post, which was later removed, was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) The post is false and ridiculous.  There’s no question that an earthquake and its devastating aftershocks are what caused the growing death toll, and that natural factors triggered the quake. ""There is no chance that this tragic event was induced by humans,"" said James Gaherty, a professor in the School of Earth and Sustainability at Northern Arizona University. ""This region is known to host natural events of this size and scope. It is undoubtedly a natural event."" Let’s first unpack some of what the post said aside from the earthquake. The Kurds are one of the indigenous peoples of the Middle East and are predominantly Sunni Muslims, according to the  Council on Foreign Relations, a New York-based think tank. Americans might be most familiar with the Kurds in Syria. In 2014, a U.S.-led international coalition partnered with Kurdish forces to fight the rise of the Islamic State, or ISIS, terrorist group in Syria.  In Turkey, a Kurdish separatist group has waged an insurgency since 1984 against Turkish authorities, including Erdogan, mainly seeking to establish an independent Kurdish state, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Erdogan is up for reelection in May. Now, to earthquakes. An earthquake occurs when two blocks of the Earth suddenly slip past one another. The surface where they slip is a fault.  Geophysicist Lisa Wald, a spokesperson for the U.S. Geological Survey, told PolitiFact that the area around the Feb. 6 earthquake is ""a very seismically active area, since it is in the region of the plate boundaries of three different tectonic plates."" The quake was caused ""by the plates moving slowly and their edges getting locked for a long time, and then the forces finally overcoming the friction and the plate edges suddenly slipping,"" she said. It's the same kind of quake that occurs along the San Andreas Fault in California, NPR reported. Since 1970, only three earthquakes of magnitude 6 or larger have occurred within 250 kilometers (155 miles) of the Feb. 6 earthquake, the Geological Survey said. The quake devastated areas as far as 200 miles from the epicenter, including Diyarbakir, the world's biggest Kurdish city and the unofficial capital of Turkey’s eastern Kurdish regions, The New York Times reported. Hmans can trigger temblors, though none as big as the one on Feb. 6. Earthquakes can be induced by such human activity as surface and underground mining, and injecting fluids into underground formations, according to the Geological Survey. Wald said wastewater injection after hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, for example, can trigger small- to moderate-sized earthquakes in a location ""where there was a fault poised to have an earthquake already."" The largest earthquake from this activity was around a magnitude 5, she said. An Instagram post that was later taken down said: ""This ‘earthquake’ is a systemic attack against Kurdish people."" The claim was that there was a politically motivated attack and no earthquake. Experts said there is no question that a 7.8-magnitude temblor on Feb. 6 is responsible for more than 20,000 deaths in Turkey and Syria",False Pants on Fire,"February 9, 2023"
“NASA stopped exploring the ocean.”,"A video shared on Instagram claimed that NASA, the federal agency most associated with space, has stopped exploring Earth’s oceans. The video suggested the agency did so out of fear. Text on the screen appeared as the narrator said:  ""Have you ever wondered why NASA stopped exploring the ocean?...What did they discover down there? What are they so afraid of?"" The post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) In September, Lead Stories and USA Today fact-checked similar videos and rated them false.  This new claim is wrong, too. ""NASA has been involved in ocean science research since its founding"" in 1958, a NASA spokesperson told PolitiFact. The work happens in the sea and from satellites.  Here’s some of what we found: NASA’s Physical Oceanography program involves research for understanding the ocean’s role in climate. Study areas include sea level change, ocean surface topography and ocean surface salinity. Researchers also study ocean salinity as it relates to weather phenomena. In December, NASA presented a 2½-hour program on its Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission, which will ""survey nearly all water on the Earth's surface for the first time."" The journal Science reported that the $1.5 billion mission will study circular movements of water known as eddies, ""the most energetic feature of the ocean, critical to getting climate models right.""  In January 2022, the BBC reported on NASA’s exploration of ""the deep ocean to search for clues of what oceans on other planets could look like."" The Systematic Underwater Biogeochemical Science and Exploration Analog program, or SUBSEA, uses remotely operated vehicles launched from a sea vessel to study ocean depths, according to NASA. In 2024, NASA plans to launch a space observatory for further ocean study. On an oceanography page of its website, NASA explained why it studies oceans:  ""Part of NASA's mission is to develop an understanding of the total Earth system and the effects of natural and human-induced changes on the global environment. Our oceans play a major role in influencing changes in the world's climate and weather."" An Instagram post said: ""NASA stopped exploring the ocean.""

“The White House is now attempting to ban all gas ovens and burners.”,"Fox News viewers might think a government agency is cooking up a plan to take away their gas stoves and ovens, after comments from network host Sean Hannity. ""Now, not only is (President Joe) Biden coming for your paycheck, but he's coming for your stove. You heard me right."" Hannity said Jan. 9 during his show. ""The White House is now attempting to ban all gas ovens and burners, that's like half the country."" The Washington Post reported that 40 million U.S. homes have gas stoves. Prominent conservatives, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Fox News host Tucker Carlson, repeated the claim. So did  Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Fox News did not respond to our request for comment. But Hannity's remarks appear to stem from a published interview with a commissioner from the Consumer Product Safety Commission, a federal agency that regulates consumer goods, which said a ban on gas stoves could be considered.  Hannity’s claim mischaracterized the commissioner's remark and left out important context. Although the commissioner did not rule out the possibility of banning gas stoves, he also did not say a ban was in the works.  Gas stoves emit a poisonous gas when in use, especially in homes with poor ventilation. Several studies have linked emissions from gas stoves with increased health risks. One study found nearly 13% of childhood asthma cases in the U.S. are attributed to gas stove use.  There are also environmental risks. CBS News has reported that a 2022 study in the journal Environmental Science & Technology said U.S. gas stoves put 2.6 million tons of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, into the air annually. Nevertheless, the commission’s chair, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, a Biden appointee, said in a statement that neither he nor the safety commission is seeking to ban gas kitchen appliances. The White House also rebuffed Hannity's claim. ""The president does not support banning gas stoves,"" a White House spokesperson told PolitiFact.   I want to set the record straight.Contrary to recent media reports, I am not looking to ban gas stoves and the @USCPSC has no proceeding to do so. Read my full statement: pic.twitter.com/bYS1GLEpXP Commissioner Rich Trumka Jr. was quoted in a Jan. 9 Bloomberg News article discussing gas stoves’ health risks and how the commission might address them. ""Any option is on the table,"" said Trumka, also a Biden appointee. ""Products that can’t be made safe can be banned.""  It wasn’t the first time Trumka mentioned a potential ban. The energy and environmental news organization, E&E News, reported he made a similar statement in December during a webinar hosted by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.  ""I think we ought to keep that possibility of a ban in mind as you follow along, because it’s a powerful tool in our toolbox and it’s a real possibility here, particularly because there seems to be readily available alternatives already on the market,"" Trumka said. His comments came months after he had received no support on the issue from his fellow commissioners.  In an October meeting detailing the agency’s plans for 2023, Trumka introduced an amendment for a proposed rule to address gas stove safety. No other commissioners supported the amendment. Trumka then proposed a second amendment, which received unanimous support, for the commission to seek public comment on risks associated with gas stoves and possible solutions to address them. The request for information is set to be published by March 1.  When we asked the commission about Trumka’s recent comments, Communications Director Pamela Springs said his position isn’t the agency’s. Although there are no plans to ban gas kitchen appliances, the commission has the authority to do so. However, that action is considered only when there is no other reasonable way to protect people from the danger an item poses. The agency last banned a product in 2001, when it prohibited dive sticks, a pool toy, Springs told PolitiFact.  Even if products are banned, the commission lacks the power to remove products that are already in consumers’ homes. Bans and regulations apply to manufacturers and sellers.  ""Our laws relate to manufacturing, importing, selling, offering for sale and distributing in commerce, not to consumer possession,"" Springs said.  Trumka repeated that point after backlash from Rep. Gary Palmer, R-Ala. ""To be clear, CPSC isn't coming for anyone's gas stoves,"" Trumka tweeted Jan. 9. ""Regulations apply to new products.""   Thanks for your interest!To be clear, CPSC isn't coming for anyone's gas stoves. Regulations apply to new products. For Americans who CHOOSE to switch from gas to electric, there is support available - Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act which includes a $840 rebate. https://t.co/fcmWMSSfE5 Some states and cities have moved to regulate and ban gas stoves in new homes. In April, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul proposed a plan to ban gas hookups in new buildings in the state’s budget. In May, the Los Angeles City Council voted to ban most gas appliances in new homes.  But several Republican-led states have passed bills to preemptively prevent a ban on gas hookups in new construction.  Hannity said ""the White House is now attempting to ban all gas ovens and burners."" One commissioner from the Consumer Product Safety Commission said in an interview that a ban could be considered. But the commission chair rebutted that notion, saying the agency is not seeking a ban.  The commission is researching health risks related to gas stoves, and will seek the public’s ideas on the issue this year",False,"January 12, 2023"
"Large machinery is “required to move 500,000 pounds of earth in order to get the minerals needed for one single Tesla car battery.”","Electric cars are frequently criticized for hidden environmental impacts, from carbon dioxide emitted during manufacturing to the source of electricity while charging.  A point of criticism is the environmental risks associated with mining lithium, a vital component of electric car batteries. One Instagram post focused on heavy machinery used as part of the mining process.  The Nov. 30 post is a screenshot of another social media post, featuring an image of a person dwarfed by a large yellow Caterpillar haul truck. The same image has been used in other social media posts that make similar statements about electric car batteries.  ""This machine is required to move 500,000 pounds of earth in order to get the minerals needed for ONE SINGLE (Tesla) car battery,"" the text in the screenshot reads. ""In whose world does this type of math and green new deal make sense?"" The post doesn’t provide further information to back up its claim and doesn’t specify what minerals are needed for a Tesla battery. Besides lithium, Tesla batteries also contain cobalt and nickel, minerals that are also mined.  The post misleads by implying that it takes enormous, gas-powered machinery moving huge amounts of material to produce a single electric vehicle. The Instagram post was flagged as part of Instagram’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) Corby Anderson, a Colorado School of Mines professor, said mining operations typically use large-haul trucks, like the one in the Instagram post, to transport materials. A moderately sized haul truck can carry 500,000 pounds — equivalent to 250 tons — of material. ""Moving 250 tons of material is not that big a deal in the mining industry,"" he said. The Instagram post doesn’t include any information about how lithium is sourced or how much lithium is needed in a Tesla battery. Half of the lithium used in the world comes not from mining, but from extraction through geothermal brines. Saltwater is evaporated and the mineral is harvested from the desiccated remnants, said Brendan Moran, a hydrogeology researcher at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Brine extraction doesn’t move large amounts of earth and wouldn’t require a large truck.  When lithium is obtained through traditional mining, it’s done primarily in Australia from spodumene, a mineral consisting of lithium aluminum inosilicate.  Moran said Tesla batteries can contain ""somewhere between 5 to 75 kilograms"" (11 to 165 pounds) of lithium depending on the model. Tesla gets the lithium for its batteries from both brine and hard-rock sources. The post says 500,000 pounds of earth must be moved to extract enough lithium for one Tesla battery. But that is inaccurate when it comes to spodumene mining, Moran said; It takes less than 10,000 pounds of ore to produce around 2,000 pounds of spodumene.  The only way a truck hauling 500,000 pounds of earth would contain minerals for just a single car battery is if the ore’s lithium content was 0.1%, Anderson said.  The hard-rock mine that supplies some of the lithium Tesla uses said its ore naturally contains up to about 2.1% lithium, making it highly unlikely that a truck would carry enough mineral for only one battery.  ""Mining is extractive and does not have zero (environmental) impact, but the impact spans a large range, and lithium mining and use is on the low end of this, not to mention necessary to build a fully electric economy,"" Moran said. An Instagram post shared an image of large machinery and said it’s ""required to move 500,000 pounds of earth in order to get the minerals needed for one single Tesla car battery."" The only way a truck hauling 500,000 pounds of earth would contain minerals for just a single car battery is if the ore’s lithium content was 0.1%. The ores from the hard-rock mine Tesla uses contain up to 2.1% lithium. It takes less than 10,000 pounds of material to produce 2,000 pounds of spodumene — a mineral filled with lithium aluminum inosilicate. The maximum amount of lithium a Tesla car battery contains is around 165 pounds",False,"December 13, 2022"
West Virginia is poised to “receive $25M for 160 orphaned well clean-up projects across the state.”,"Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., was one of the lawmakers who helped craft the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which allocates $1.2 trillion to fund highways, transit, rail, broadband access, clean water and electric grid improvements. President Joe Biden signed the act into law in November 2021.  About nine months after the bill was enacted, Manchin took a victory lap on Twitter, spotlighting one of the law’s benefits for his home state.  ""West Virginia will receive $25M for 160 orphaned well clean-up projects across the state,"" Manchin tweeted Aug. 26. ""This funding from my Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will make our communities safer and healthier while revitalizing rural economies throughout WV."" GREAT NEWS: West Virginia will receive $25M for 160 orphaned well clean-up projects across the state. This funding from my Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will make our communities safer and healthier while revitalizing rural economies throughout WV. MORE: https://t.co/Gv5ECrwYYV We decided to take a closer look at the accuracy of Manchin’s tweet. Orphaned wells are abandoned oil and gas wells that have been left unattended by companies that cannot afford to cap them. Officials say these wells are not just an eyesore but can cause methane leaks and contaminate water supplies, causing serious health problems for people living nearby.   Cleaning up orphan wells is only one of the many projects included in the infrastructure law. One of the ways that states, such as West Virginia, can benefit from the law is to apply for funding to remediate orphan wells on state land, or on private land within the state.  Under this provision, states can initially request up to $25 million. States promise to use at least 90% of this funding for contracts and grants to remediate the sites, and to spend the money within one year of its receipt. Erin Heeter, a Manchin spokesperson, confirmed that the state applied to receiver $25 million. She also presented documentation that the U.S. Interior Department had authorized West Virginia’s request.  The Interior Department document was dated Aug. 24, two days before Manchin’s tweet. It authorizes $25 million to be spent by the state Department of Environmental Protection through Sept. 30, 2023. It takes an average of about $55,000 to cap an orphan well with a material such as concrete, so it should be possible to cap at least 160 wells with the Interior Department’s allocation. In its public announcement of the grants, the Interior Department said it expects West Virginia to cap 160 orphan wells with this round of funding. The federal money will be used not only to remediate the 160 known wells but also can be applied to wells that have not yet been identified. West Virginia could receive additional money for orphan wells in the future, under different provisions of the law. Manchin tweeted that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is on track to provide West Virginia with ""$25M for 160 Orphaned Well Clean-up Projects.""

The Instagram caption says, ""Are we really supposed to believe that a mammal living as it should in harmony in its natural environment somehow ‘emits’ a toxic gas that is bad for the planet and we as humans must reduce their population to save the planet from destruction?

Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, trap heat in the atmosphere, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Methane is one of the main greenhouse gases that contributes to climate change, according to the World Meteorological Association and the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  All organisms produce methane, according to a study in the journal Nature.  Cattle are ruminants — grass-chewing animals with hooves and multichambered stomachs. Other ruminants include deer, goats and buffalo.  ""What characterizes a ruminant animal is a specialized digestive system that allows them to break down and digest food that is undigestible by non-ruminants, such as humans,"" according to the Clarity and Leadership for Environmental Awareness and Research Center at the University of California, Davis. Cattle store food in one part of their stomachs, where it ferments. The fermentation ""produces the greenhouse gas, methane, as well as a host of other byproducts,"" according to the center, which also notes that ""decomposing food in landfills does the same thing."" The cattle then release methane, mainly by belching but also through flatulence.  The Instagram post says we shouldn’t believe that a mammal living in harmony with its environment could produce methane.  But ""whether an animal lives in harmony with nature has unfortunately very little to do with the amount of greenhouse gases it produces,"" Reisinger said. ""Every cow, even one that munches happily on pesticide and fertilizer-free grass, will produce methane.""

"For climate change environmentalists, “not a single one of their predictions ever come true.”","A conservative commentator made the unfounded claim that climate scientists are always wrong in their predictions.  For climate change environmentalists, ""not a single one of their predictions ever come true,"" said Charlie Kirk, founder and president of the conservative group Turning Point USA, in a clip from his show posted Oct. 3 on Instagram. Kirk compared climate science to religion and described climate change environmentalists as ""the pagans.""  The Instagram post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) However, we found several instances of climate change predictions, including those going back to the 1970s, that closely matched what came to pass.  Kirk did not respond to a request for comment. It isn’t uncommon for climate skeptics to claim climate predictions have been wrong. Many climate change predictions are based on modeling, which involves putting data into a computer program and having the program make predictions. It’s not a perfect science, as it’s difficult to account for all the relevant data about an entire planet.  One way to determine a model’s accuracy is to look at old models and see how well they withstood the test of time. A 2019 study in the journal Geophysical Research Letters showed that of 17 climate models published from 1970 to 2007, 10 closely matched the global average temperatures that occurred. That number increased to 14 after ""accounting for differences between modeled and actual changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and other factors that drive climate,"" according to a 2020 NASA article about the study.  Another 2012 study in the journal Nature Climate Change found that 1990 predictions from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change were fairly accurate. IPCC had suggested that by 2030, Earth would have warmed about 1.1 degrees Celsius, which would amount to about 0.55 degrees Celsius by 2012. The warming that occurred was about 0.39 degrees Celsius.  Despite the difference in the projected and actual temperatures, the 1990 prediction is accurate, Penny Whetton, senior principal research scientist at the Australian government agency Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and a lead author for the Third Assessment Report of the IPCC, told the nonprofit news website The Conversation in 2012. The difference between the projected 0.55 degrees and the observed 0.39 degrees is because of natural fluctuations, Whetton said. ""This is good evidence to show that what the IPCC has been saying for a while is coming true,"" she added.  Gavin A. Schmidt, director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, has noted that plenty of climate predictions have come true. For example, in a 2021 opinion column, he pointed to the Nobel prize-winning Suki Manabe, who in 1967 correctly predicted surface warming and stratospheric cooling. And since its 1990 prediction, the IPCC has continued to make predictions that end up being close to real, observed temperatures. Schmidt said in an email interview with PolitiFact that Kirk’s ""summary of the success of climate modeling is simply wrong."" Schmidt said there are always examples of sensationalized predictions in the scientific community, but Kirk was ""clearly implying something about the mainstream scientific community, not unsupported outliers."" Kirk says for climate change environmentalists, ""not a single one of their predictions ever come true.""  The claim is not supported by evidence.

"“More than half of the $739 billion tax increase (in the Inflation Reduction Act) will go to wasteful Green New Deal programs like tree equity, 'clean' garbage trucks, and studying cow farts.""","As the most conservative Democrat serving in the Senate — and as a senator representing West Virginia, a state that supported Donald Trump in 2020 by almost 39 percentage points — Joe Manchin has stoked critics on both the right and the left. For months, Manchin balked at supporting President Joe Biden’s climate change agenda, irritating many of his fellow Democrats. But then, this past summer, quiet negotiations between Manchin and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., produced a breakthrough, enabling Manchin to support what became the Inflation Reduction Act. The legislation included provisions that allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices, extend Affordable Care Act subsidies, impose higher taxes on the largest corporations and tackle climate change. The measure included tax credits for cutting carbon emissions from electricity, vehicles and manufacturing operations. The bill passed the House and Senate on party-line votes before Biden signed it into law. Suddenly, Manchin’s role in enabling the bill’s enactment prompted criticism from conservatives. One of the groups criticizing Manchin was Citizens Against Government Waste, which advocates for ""the elimination of waste and inefficiency in government."" Officially, the group is nonpartisan, but its focus on cutting federal spending tends to align with Republican policies. In its 2021 congressional vote ratings, House and Senate Republicans scored vastly better than House and Senate Democrats did.  After the Inflation Reduction Act passed, the group named Manchin its ""porker of the month"" for enabling ""pork-barrel"" spending. It bought space on Facebook to run an animated ad in which it criticizes Manchin’s vote. (""Pork"" or ""pork barrel"" spending is government spending for localized projects secured primarily or solely for bringing money to political representatives’ districts.) Part of the ad said, ""More than half of the $739 billion tax increase will go to wasteful Green New Deal programs like tree equity, 'clean' garbage trucks, and studying cow farts.""  (Screenshot) The $739 billion refers to the revenue raised as part of the bill, mostly from tax hikes on the biggest corporations and from federal spending saved by Medicare being able to negotiate drug prices. Because a portion comes from saved spending, it’s not accurate to call the entire $739 billion a ""tax increase,"" as the ad does. The tax portion of the revenue increase is about $457 billion. Meanwhile, the Green New Deal refers to a far-reaching environmental proposal by progressive Democrats in 2019 that did not make it into legislative form and was never voted on. Half of the stated $739 billion in new revenue would work out to about $370 billion. So, would provisions on ""tree equity, 'clean' garbage trucks, and studying cow farts"" cost that much? We decided to find out.  Citizens Against Government Waste did not respond to inquiries for this article. All told, the legislation would spend $391 billion on climate and energy, according to an analysis of the bill’s revenue and spending provisions by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a nonprofit focused on raising awareness about the United States’ future fiscal challenges.  So, more than half of the new revenue raised would go toward environmental and clean energy uses, broadly defined. But the ad’s focus on ""tree equity, ‘clean’ garbage trucks, and studying cow farts"" cherry-picks a relatively small (and, to some, silly-sounding) portion of that amount. The bill does include elements that address these topics, but they are only a small fraction of the total amount being spent. Although the legislation doesn’t use the term ""tree equity,"" it does include a notable investment in tree planting in urban areas, especially those with relatively few trees. The idea is to ""help cities plant more trees in the places where they're needed most,"" Jad Daley, president and CEO of the environmental advocacy group American Forests, told PolitiFact. Greater tree cover is designed to reduce heat-related deaths, remove carbon from the atmosphere and lower cooling bills, especially in cities. The new law allocates $1.5 billion to the U.S. Forest Service’s Urban and Community Forestry program, which averages to $150 million a year over the bill's 10-year life. That’s a substantial cash infusion for the program, which has been funded at around $30 million to $40 million per year for the past few years, Matt Spitsen, program development manager for the Arbor Day Foundation, a nonprofit group devoted to planting trees, told PolitiFact in August.  The bill includes $600 million over 10 years for grants to allow states, municipalities, Indian tribes or school transportation associations to replace conventional heavy vehicles with zero-emission vehicles.  This extends beyond garbage trucks and could cover many other types of heavy-duty vehicles, said Sylvia Chi, an environmental and economic justice attorney with Just Solutions Collective in Oakland, California. Methane contributes to climate change, and by some estimates, cattle are the No. 1 agricultural source of greenhouse gases worldwide. (Technically, methane comes mostly from cow burps, not farts.) As a result, environmentalists have sought to curb its atmospheric release.  The only provision of the legislation that specifically addresses ""enteric methane emissions from ruminants"" comes under the heading of agricultural conservation. The legislation allocates almost $8.5 billion for all types of conservation over four years, with the agriculture secretary ""prioritizing proposals that utilize diet and feed management to reduce enteric methane emissions from ruminants."" In all likelihood, cattle-related projects would account for a small fraction of that $8.5 billion. However, even assuming that 100 percent of that sum goes to fund cow-fart projects, the total for tree planting, ""clean"" garbage trucks and cattle emissions would amount to $10.6 billion, or 1.4% of the $739 billion in new revenue — not ""more than half."" And if only 10% of the conservation grants went to cattle projects, that would make the total for the three categories a little less than $3 billion, or less than half of 1% of the $739 billion in revenue raised. The Citizens Against Government Waste ad said, ""More than half of the $739 billion tax increase (in the Inflation Reduction Act) will go to wasteful Green New Deal programs like tree equity, 'clean' garbage trucks, and studying cow farts."" First, calling the $739 billion a tax increase is exaggerated. Not counting federal health care savings that are counted as revenue, the tax increase’s scale is about $457 billion. The bill’s environmental provisions do add up to $391 billion, or more than half of $739 billion. However, the amount spent on trees, clean trucks and cattle emissions account for a tiny fraction of that, somewhere between one-half of 1% and 1.4%",Mostly False,"October 25, 2022"
"""In Germany, millions of solar panels are blanketed in snow and 30,000 wind turbines are sitting idle because there’s no wind.”","A viral post from more than a year ago has been recirculating, claiming that German renewable energy isn’t working properly due to winter weather.  ""In Germany, millions of solar panels are blanketed in snow and 30,000 wind turbines are sitting idle because there’s no wind,"" said a meme shared Sept. 25 on Instagram. It includes a photo of snow-blanketed solar panels.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) The claim, however, has no basis in fact. German solar panels and wind turbines were functioning normally in 2021, this claim previously circulated. And experts say winter weather hasn’t generally posed a significant threat to renewable energy.  The meme in the post cites the Australian news site SkyNews. A February 2021 segment from the SkyNews show ""Outsiders,"" shows Australian conservative news commentator Rowan Dean stating that ""millions of solar panels are blanketed in snow and 30,000 wind turbines are sitting idle because there’s no wind."" Dean did not elaborate about the source of his claim and he didn’t respond to PolitiFact’s request for more information. We found the photo on the website of British stock photo agency Alamy with a caption that reads, ""Solar panels are covered with snow at the solar park in Meuro, Germany, 21 February 2013. Despite covered by snow the modules produce 5 megawatts of power."" According to a website that tracks energy production data, German solar and wind production experienced no significant or sudden drops during February 2021.  Experts told PolitiFact that cold weather and lack of wind can affect energy production, but the implication of a mass failure of these energy sources is wrong. ""The claim that millions of PV (photovoltaic) modules don't provide electricity in winter is of course nonsense,"" Karsten Schafer, a spokesman for the German Solar Industry Association, told Agence France-Presse in 2021 for a fact-check about a similar meme.  Snow buildup doesn’t cause significant issues in Germany’s ability to produce solar power, according to Ute Stewart, press and communication officer for Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue. In an email to PolitiFact, Stewart wrote that there is almost never a day when intense snowfall affects the whole country.   ""If you look at the yearly yield,"" Stewart wrote, ""the loss (of solar power) is insignificant at best, under 1%."" At higher altitudes, the loss of solar power because of snowfall can be up to 6%, he wrote, but there aren’t many solar panels at higher altitudes. Some of the snowiest countries in the world use solar power.  An Instagram post says, ""In Germany, millions of solar panels are blanketed in snow and 30,000 wind turbines are sitting idle because there’s no wind.""  There is no data or evidence to support this claim.

“Tim Ryan when he ran for president two years ago … supported banning fracking both on public lands and generally speaking.”,"The candidates in one of the nation’s hottest midterm races — the contest for an open U.S. Senate seat in Ohio — came out swinging in an Oct. 10 debate, with Republican J.D. Vance and Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan accusing each other of being dishonest. Here, we’ll examine an exchange involving Ryan’s stance on natural gas production. It’s an issue of importance to Ohio, which ranks as the nation’s sixth-biggest producer of natural gas. Vance raised energy policy in the debate’s opening exchange, saying that Democrats have ""gone to war"" against the domestic energy sector. Ryan countered by citing provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed Aug. 16, that Ryan said go ""all in on natural gas."" He continued, ""I’ve been a natural gas proponent since I’ve been in Congress. And we have to get this right. We need to increase our production of natural gas. I support streamlining the permitting process around natural gas so we can get it around the country, lower costs for businesses, and ship it to Europe to stick our finger in Vladimir Putin’s eye."" Vance, however, wasn’t buying Ryan’s claim that he’s championed natural gas production. Vance said, ""Tim Ryan just told a big fib. He said he supported Ohio’s natural gas industry and he’s always done so. And yet Tim Ryan when he ran for president, two years ago, you supported banning fracking both on public lands and generally speaking."" Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, injects water, chemicals and sand at ultrahigh pressure to crack open rock layers and release trapped natural gas. The method has enabled the United States to become a world leader in natural gas production, but it has also caused controversy among environmentalists and local residents’ groups, who argue its chemicals can pollute the environment and seep into water supplies. Environmentalists also worry that fracking can trigger earthquakes. Responding to Vance, Ryan countered, ""You could go back my entire career. We have two natural gas power plants in my congressional district that I helped us get. And the union that works in the natural gas industry endorsed me. Do you think they’re going to endorse me if I’m for banning fracking? It’s just not true."" JD VANCE: ""Tim Ryan just told a big fib. He said he supported Ohio's natural gas industry and he's always done so.""""When he ran for president, just two years ago, you supported banning fracking both on public lands and generally speaking."" pic.twitter.com/JtOY9FmpSZ So what’s going on here? We found that both sides are engaging in some spin. Ryan expressed an openness to banning fracking in 2019, when he was running a short-lived campaign for president. The comment came during a joint forum on climate change with another longshot primary candidate, then-Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, in the early primary state of New Hampshire.  During a question-and-answer session, an audience member introduced herself as a participant in a local group that was fighting a pipeline for fracked natural gas. She asked, ""If elected, would you consider banning fracking on federal lands?"" Ryan responded, ""Absolutely. Absolutely. On federal lands. I see the natural gas piece as a transition for us,"" from fossil fuels to renewable energy. After the debate, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate GOP’s campaign arm, noted that Ryan in 2017 joined most Democrats in supporting an amendment to an appropriations bill to bar the spending of federal funds on the processing of drilling permits applications for fracking in the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf. The amendment did not address permits on nonfederal lands. Vance’s campaign pointed PolitiFact to comments Ryan made to The Washington Post about regulating fracking to prevent environmental damage. ""If the industry cannot rapidly innovate on these issues, I believe the federal government would need to step in and halt fracking operations,"" Ryan said in 2020.  Ryan’s statement during the 2019 forum came in response to a question about banning fracking on federal lands only. The questioner did not ask Ryan about the possibility of banning fracking everywhere, and asked only whether he’d ""consider"" the move. The 2017 amendment Ryan supported would have paused fracking on the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf, in sensitive environmental waters off California, thousands of miles from Ohio and any land-based fracking operations there. Ryan’s 2020 comments to the Post were focused on ensuring that local households aren’t hurt by fracking. Ryan told the Post that despite his environmental concerns, fracking ""has provided enormous economic benefits and moved the U.S. towards energy independence."" Ryan also told the Post the industry needed more oversight and regulation, ""especially in regard to its use and disposal of water, as well as methane leaks. ... If the industry cannot rapidly innovate on these issues, I believe the federal government would need to step in and halt fracking operations."" This line of argument — that fracking is economically valuable but needs to be regulated for its environmental risks — is bolstered by legislation Ryan co-sponsored in 2018, the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals, or FRAC, Act.  The measure, which did not pass, required disclosure of the chemicals used in fracking fluids and removed the oil and gas industry's exemption from the Safe Drinking Water Act. This would allow the industry to continue operating, but in a more regulated manner. Ryan’s support for it complicates Vance’s argument that he wants to simply ban fracking. Ryan has also spoken favorably about fracking during his Senate campaign. In April 2022, Ryan praised the local natural gas extraction economy in eastern Ohio, which fracking enabled. ""This is a hell of an opportunity for eastern Ohio to sell natural gas to Eastern Europe and knock Vladimir Putin’s legs out from under him,"" Ryan said. ""This needs to be a key part of our global strategy, and it’s about jobs, you know, good family wages here, good union jobs here in eastern Ohio. And I’m all for it and I’ll do anything I can to help with this project and any other project we can establish here."" Vance said that Ryan, ""when he ran for president, two years ago ... supported banning fracking both on public lands and generally speaking."" Ryan said during a 2019 event that he would ""absolutely"" consider banning fracking on federal lands. He also voted to stop the processing of fracking applications for drilling sites off the California coast in environmentally sensitive water. Ryan told The Washington Post that if the fracking industry cannot keep local residents safe, the federal government might need to ""halt"" fracking operations. However, Ryan’s full record of statements and policies on fracking is more nuanced than Vance suggests. Ryan’s focus has been on leveraging natural gas as a transitional fuel and a source of revenue and jobs for Ohio. He’s said he supports fracking as long as the industry keeps the environmental risks in check",Half True,"October 11, 2022"
"U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio ""has denied climate change.""","With Florida's southwestern coast facing a difficult recovery from Hurricane Ian, environmental issues have advanced to the forefront of the state's U.S. Senate race. Democratic Rep. Val Demings blasted her opponent, Republican incumbent Sen. Marco Rubio, for snubbing the idea of climate change for years. ""Marco has denied climate change and refuses to deal with the issues that affect our environment,"" Demings said in a Sept. 23 tweet. ""Florida deserves better.""  Generally, climate change refers to shifts in temperatures and weather patterns driven largely by humans and their burning of fossil fuels. The connection between climate change and hurricanes is complicated and involves ongoing research, PolitiFact reported. Rubio's past skepticism of climate change science is well documented.  When a liberal group in 2013 said Rubio is ""a climate change denier,"" we rated the statement Mostly True. The caveat was that some of Rubio's remarks about climate change bordered on skepticism rather than outright denial. But Rubio's stance has shifted in recent years. Since 2018, Rubio has said Earth's climate is changing and humans, to some degree, have contributed to the changes.  Rubio's position on climate change seemed ambiguous before he set his sights on national office. As Florida House speaker in 2007, for example, Rubio referenced the existence of global warming and embraced energy diversification.  ""Global warming, dependence on foreign sources of fuel, and capitalism have come together to create opportunities for us that were unimaginable just a few short years ago,"" Rubio said in a speech to state legislators. ""Florida has the opportunity to pursue bold energy policies, not just because they're good for our environment, but because people can actually make money doing it.""  At the time, Rubio didn't outright acknowledge humans' ​​​​impact on the environment. By 2009, as he launched his bid for the U.S. Senate, Rubio began questioning whether humans have caused climate change.   Asked about human impact on the climate in 2009, Rubio told the Miami Herald: ""I'm not a scientist. I'm not qualified to make that decision. There's a significant scientific dispute about that."" Rubio took his firmest stance against the concept that people can affect the environment in 2010, telling the Tampa Tribune ahead of the election that he didn't ""think there's the scientific evidence to justify it."" He won that election and has served in the U.S. Senate for more than a decade. Throughout his early years in Congress, Rubio opposed environmental legislation spearheaded by former President Barack Obama. ""I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it,"" he said on ABC News' ""This Week"" in 2014. ""And I do not believe that the laws that they propose we pass will do anything about it. Except it will destroy our economy."" We rated Rubio's claim about human activity not contributing to climate change False. At other times, Rubio skirted the question without outright denying the human role. ""Sure, the climate is changing,"" Rubio said at a Republican presidential debate on March 10, 2016. ""There was never a time when the climate was not changing."" At the debate, he did not acknowledge human contribution to climate change. By 2018, Rubio began saying in public remarks that humans, to some degree, have contributed to climate change. His comments came after Hurricane Michael devastated the Florida Panhandle and drew national media attention.  In an interview with CBS' John Dickerson, Rubio said: ""My view is climate, sea level rise, these are measurable things. You can measure that. So there, it's not even a scientific debate at some point, it's just a reality debate."" Dickerson pressed Rubio further on whether he thought humans were the chief contributor to climate change, to which Rubio said, ""That's what a lot of scientists say."" But Rubio noted that a few scientists ""dispute what percentage"" can be attributed to humans.  PolitiFact has examined similar attempts to minimize humans' role in climate change. We found that increased levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases can cause the Earth to warm. Humans have increased the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by nearly 50% since 1750, according to NASA.  Rubio's campaign also pointed to two op-eds Rubio wrote for USA Today in 2019. In the first op-ed, he acknowledged that ""Earth's climate is changing."" In the second op-ed, he encouraged ""proactive adaptation,"" which he said ""could reduce damage caused by climate change.""  He also joined the bipartisan Senate Climate Solutions Caucus in February 2020. ""Changes in our climate, such as the rise of sea levels, are measurable facts,"" Rubio said in a press release. ""I look forward to working with my colleagues to find real and responsible solutions in a bipartisan way."" Democrats and environmentalists have criticized Rubio's actions as ""greenwashing"" — meaning he says he supports solutions to climate change but rejects measures that would make the most impact, such as reducing carbon emissions through cap and trade. Meanwhile, Rubio has criticized Democrats' approach to climate change as an excuse for bad policies. Demings said Rubio ""has denied climate change."" For about a decade, Rubio denied or downplayed humans' role in changing or worsening the climate. In recent years, he has acknowledged that humans contribute to climate change. He isn't on board with Democratic plans to respond to the crisis, but he has shown more interest in what he calls ""responsible solutions"" to climate-related issues such as rising sea levels.

"Lee County, Florida, wasn't ""even in the cone"" of Hurricane Ian 72 hours before landfall.","Hurricane Ian battered Florida's southwestern coast Sept. 28, leaving streets flooded, buildings destroyed and people homeless. Lee County, which includes Cape Coral and Fort Myers, has some of the most extensive damage. Media coverage of the area's mounting death toll prompted questions about whether Lee County officials gave residents ample notice to evacuate. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Lee County Commission Chairman Cecil Pendergrass rebuffed the questions on Oct. 2, saying the data available before landfall did not warrant such a response. ""Seventy-two hours before the storm, we still were not in the cone,"" Pendergrass said during a press conference. ""We were working off of data and went off that data."" DeSantis also said Lee County based its decision on the National Hurricane Center's track forecast. ""They were following the weather track and they had to make decisions based on that,"" he said in an interview with CNN. ""But you know, 72 hours, they weren't even in the cone."" Federal officials echoed the comments from state officials. Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell made a claim about Lee County that was similar to DeSantis' during an Oct. 2 appearance on ABC's ""This Week."" We reviewed eight advisories the National Hurricane Center issued Sept. 25 — three days before Ian made landfall. Most of Lee County was not within the forecasted path three days before landfall. But one of the county's barrier islands, Cayo Costa — where the Category 4 hurricane made landfall — appeared inside the cone on each of eight advisories from Sept. 25. (No advisory was issued exactly 72 hours before Ian made landfall at 3:05 p.m.) The cone graphic that DeSantis and Pendergrass referenced is often misunderstood, according to the National Hurricane Center. The visual is meant to show the probable track of the center of the storm — not the extent of a hurricane's reach. Focusing on the cone itself downplays the impacts of a storm as large as Ian. Still, in Ian's case, the cone was an accurate forecast of the storm's eventual trajectory, an expert said. Matt Rogers, an atmospheric science researcher at Colorado State University, told PolitiFact that the cone graphic from Sept. 25 predicted that the center of Ian would cross the coastline anywhere between Cedar Key and Cayo Costa in Lee County.  ""The cone was therefore accurate,"" Rogers said. ""The cone forecast from Sunday night predicted it was possible for the center of the hurricane to be as far south as Cayo Costa, and that's what happened.""

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We didn't find credible evidence supporting this etymology. The term ""hurricane"" is derived from ""hurakan,"" a word coined by the Taino, or the indigenous people of the Caribbean, according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary.

But the background behind this claim is interesting.  ""The ‘her-ricane’ interpretation appears to be a kind of folk etymology used for rhetorical purposes regarding the slave trade,"" Ben Zimmer, a linguist and Wall Street Journal language columnist, told PolitiFact. A TinEye search revealed that a post with identical wording appeared online in 2017.

“All weather is artificially controlled.”,"Millions of people were tracking Hurricane Ian as it made its way across Florida.

Chemtrails, cloud seeding, tornadoes, hurricanes.""  He said that hurricanes could be created anywhere, and referenced an Alaska research program that uses radio transmitters to study the atmosphere. The High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program, also called HAARP, is the target of a baseless QAnon conspiracy theory that claims that it’s actually an instrument of the government, used to create weather and chemtrails.

The storm barrelled through Cuba and made landfall in Florida as a Category 4 hurricane on Sept. 28. Andrew Dessler, a professor of atmospheric sciences and the director of the Texas Center for Climate Studies at Texas A&M University, said he’s not quite sure how to respond to such a claim. ""We cannot create hurricanes nor can we throw them anywhere we want to,"" Dessler said. ""Hurricanes are not manifestations of our thoughts. If we didn’t believe in Hurricane Ian, it would still pummel the west coast of Florida."" Humans can affect the weather, but they can’t direct it, Dessler said.  ""By adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and causing the climate to warm, we are in fact turbocharging weather events to the detriment of humanity.

"""Democrats' radical green energy policies caused record gas prices. ""","The spike in gasoline prices earlier this year had Republicans crying foul, blaming President Joe Biden and Democrats for the increase — even though they began rising in late 2020 under President Donald Trump. That included a March 18 claim from U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., which we rated Mostly False: Gas prices are high ""due to the Democrats’ war on fossil fuels."" Johnson, of course, is locked in a tight re-election battle.  And, even though gasoline prices have been falling, he offered this claim in an Aug. 23 tweet: ""Democrats' radical green energy policies caused record gas prices. They want to fundamentally transform our economy."" There is little doubt about the second part of the claim. Democrats say they want to help the nation transition to a greener, more energy-efficient economy — reducing greenhouse admissions and combating climate change. But let’s look at the first part, a new twist on Johnson’s earlier claim. We do this from time to time, when a politician changes his rhetoric, and we want to see whether the new language is more accurate. So, have the Democrats and their energy policies ""caused record gas prices""? When asked to support the statement, Johnson’s spokeswoman Alexa Henning pointed us to a range of things, including all of the material sent for that earlier fact check, the one rated Mostly False. So let’s start there. As we noted in the earlier item: Gasoline prices have been rising since the initial wave of the coronavirus hit the United States in early 2020. According to a March 9 piece from PolitiFact National, gas prices were the lowest in May 2020, at $1.87 per gallon, but have since increased.  In January 2021, when Biden was inaugurated, gas prices were already at $2.33 per gallon, ahead of any policies by the new administration. As of March 2022, prices were around $4 a gallon, on average, according to PolitiFact. Gas prices would peak at a national average of $5.016 per gallon for regular unleaded on June 14, and have since fallen to $3.707 per gallon as of Sept. 13, according to AAA. Johnson and others have cited Biden’s canceling of the Keystone XL pipeline expansion, but experts say that would have had a minuscule impact on gas prices. If the new pipeline were online, it would add only about half-million barrels of oil production per day to the 95 million currently produced. But the pipeline wasn’t even projected to be on line until the first quarter of 2023 — many months from now. So, that’s more than a stretch. The other points, such as suspension of drilling and mining on Bureau of Land Management property and Biden signing an executive order barring federal funding from being used to subsidize fossil fuels were also cited as the reason for the hike in prices, also fell short. Instead, experts pointed to factors such as the coronavirus pandemic, which disrupted world markets and, more recently, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions. In short, they said, gasoline prices are part of a global market, so U.S. policy changes could contribute to price shifts, but are not solely responsible for them. Gasoline prices have risen around the world, not just in the United States, undermining the claim that the increases are solely because of Biden and Democratic policies. The main thing that has changed on this front since Johnson’s original claim, aside from prices being on the downswing, is the passage of two environment-related pieces of legislation. The first is the CHIPS Act, passed July 27, which would, according to the White House, make investments to restore and advance U.S. leadership in the research, development and manufacturing of semiconductors.  A portion of the measure includes directing about $67 billion — a quarter of its total $280 billion funding — over the next five years toward clean energy initiatives. ""That will be used to fund scientific research necessary to fight climate change, including nanotechnology, clean energy, quantum computing and artificial intelligence, as well as disaster-resilience research. It will also accelerate the growth of zero-carbon technology and establish a new federal office to organize clean-energy innovation,"" according to earth.org.  The second measure is the Inflation Reduction Act, passed Aug. 16, a wide-ranging measure that had a huge climate change component. That includes a major focus on investments in clean energy technologies, natural carbon reduction practices, and energy-efficient upgrades to businesses and homes, along with heavy investments in technologies to produce and use oil, gas, and coal in the cleanest way possible.  The problem: Those two measures were passed within the last month or so, and in that period, gasoline prices have fallen. In any case, Johnson’s staff said the senator was not referring to them in his claim. So, that leaves us essentially where we were the last time we looked at this matter. Hugh Daigle, a professor in the University of Texas, Austin’s Department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering, said looking back over the past two years or so, much of the movement in domestic gasoline prices has been driven by domestic politics, the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.  ""The most recent spike in prices over the summer was due to a combination of increased demand as the U.S. moved into a summer of travel with greatly reduced pandemic-related concerns and reduced supply due to issues with refinery capacity, all superimposed on a background of high oil and gas prices brought about by the war in Ukraine,"" Daigle told PolitiFact Wisconsin in an email.  Ericka Perryman, director of issue communications for American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, pointed out that gasoline, like the crude oil it’s made from, ""is a global commodity priced by the market according to supply and demand, both present and projected."" Perryman also said policies can affect gasoline prices. ""Crude oil is always the top driver of prices at the pump, today accounting for close to 55% of what consumers pay for gasoline. Policy also has an impact. In each of the four categories reflected in prices at the pump — the cost of crude oil, the cost of refining, distribution and marketing costs, and federal and state taxes — policy does make a difference."" So, as we noted previously, policy can play a role in gas prices — but it hardly is the only driver, or the sole one as Johnson suggests. Our ruling Johnson claimed  ""Democrats’ radical green energy policies caused record gas prices.""  Experts say things such as halting subsidies for oil companies, ending fossil fuel company drilling on public lands and ending the Keystone XL pipeline may have had a small impact on gasoline prices, but the coronavirus pandemic on the supply and demand for oil, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions had a much bigger impact.  What’s more, prices are dropping. Would that mean Democrats can argue that the new policies have alone caused the decrease? That would be a stretch as well",Mostly False,"September 16, 2022"
"""Russia is becoming the first country to break ties with the Antarctic Treaty.""","Did Russia quietly exit the decades-old Antarctic Treaty after blowing the whistle on a multinational cover-up of a secret civilization beneath the ice of the world’s southernmost continent? That’s what a TikTok video shared in a Sept. 12 Instagram post claimed. A man in the video claimed that ""Russia is now becoming the first country to break ties with the Antarctic Treaty."" ""Russia is now stating there is an entire continent"" beneath Antarctica that includes ""fresh water, lakes, rivers and civilization,"" he continued. The post was flagged as part of efforts by Facebook, which owns Instagram, to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) First, what is the Antarctic Treaty, and what is its significance? The Antarctic Treaty was originally signed by 12 nations (including the United States and Russia) in 1959 and enacted in 1961. It is a 14-article agreement intended to cooperatively regulate any official activity by governments in and around Antarctica. It also stipulates that the continent is to remain a demilitarized zone. Its intent was to foster cooperation and transparency among nations engaged in scientific research there. Representatives from member countries convene annually, most recently in Berlin from May 22 to June 3. Any sovereign country with membership in the United Nations may join. Fifty-four countries are members today. While news reports described Russia getting a cold reception at the meeting, there’s no indication Russia withdrew from the agreement. The conference was held about three months after Russia invaded Ukraine. One senior German official was quoted by the AP saying, it was ""not an easy decision to come together here in Berlin at the negotiation table while one consultative party is waging war on another consultative party."" We reviewed news articles and official materials from the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty and found no mention or reference to Russia removing itself from the agreement. On the website maintained by the secretariat, Russia remains listed as an official party to the treaty. It links to an official web page that appears to be maintained by the Russian government, summarizing ongoing projects and expeditions. We also reached out to the office of the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty to ask about the claim, but didn’t hear back. Claims that there are civilizations beneath Antarctica are baseless, as we’ve previously reported. If Earth were hollow, which claims of civilization beneath Antarctica would imply, that would require the entirety of the planet’s mass to be less dense than the rocks that help make up its crust, a University of Chicago-based geophysics expert explained in a previous interview with PolitiFact. Beyond that, scientists have collected irrefutable evidence that proves the Earth isn’t hollow.  Even though scientists cannot visit the Earth’s interior, they have learned about its composition by analyzing, among other things, the waves produced by earthquakes that run through the Earth’s interior. Those waves slow and change paths as they encounter the boundaries of the internal layers.  A TikTok video shared to Instagram claims that Russia opted out of the six-decade-old Antarctic Treaty and confirmed that there is another civilization beneath the frozen continent. There is zero evidence corroborating either claim",False Pants on Fire,"September 14, 2022"
"Joe Biden and Raphael Warnock ""are spending $1.5 billion on ‘urban forestry’ and raising taxes on those making under $200k to pay for it.”","In Georgia’s closely watched Senate race, Herschel Walker, the Republican challenger to Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, keeps circling back to a subject rarely discussed in political campaigns: trees. It began at Walker’s Aug. 21 campaign appearance, when he said of Democrats, ""They continue to try to fool you that they are helping you out, but they’re not. Because a lot of money, it’s going to trees. Don’t we have enough trees around here?"" Herschel Walker on the federal climate change bill: “They continue to try to fool you that they are helping you out. But they’re not. Because a lot of money it’s going to trees. Don’t we have enough trees around here?” #gapol #gasen  https://t.co/1HpulYTJl4 The following day, Walker doubled down, saying in a tweet, ""Yes, you heard me right … Joe Biden and @ReverendWarnock are spending $1.5 billion on ‘urban forestry’ and raising taxes on those making under $200k to pay for it. Yes, I have a problem with that."" Yes, you heard me right…Joe Biden and @ReverendWarnock are spending $1.5 billion on “urban forestry” and raising taxes on those making under $200k to pay for it. Yes, I have a problem with that. Walker was referring to the Inflation Reduction Act recently signed by President Joe Biden. He accurately represented the amount of money allocated to support urban tree cover in the Inflation Reduction Act. But his assertion that the effort is being funded by ""raising taxes on those making under"" $200,000 is misleading, since the analysis that drew that conclusion didn’t take into account the savings to Americans from other parts of the bill. When PolitiFact contacted him for this article, Walker said through his campaign, ""Our inner cities need less crime, not more trees."" It wasn’t long ago when a large majority of Republicans indicated they supported tree-planting efforts. A 2020 survey by the Pew Research Center found that 88% of Republicans supported planting about a trillion trees to absorb carbon emissions, which scientists say would help arrest climate change.  Also in 2020, President Donald Trump noted in his State of the Union address that he had worked to make sure the U.S. joined the World Economic Forum’s One Trillion Trees planting initiative. And House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., co-sponsored the One Trillion Trees Act along with 33 other House Republicans. (It did not advance.) More recently, though, Republicans and GOP-aligned groups have used trees as a rhetorical punching bag. In August, the group Citizens Against Government Waste ran a Facebook ad that ridiculed spending in the Inflation Reduction Act on such ""wasteful"" efforts as ""‘tree equity,’ ‘clean’ garbage trucks and studying cow farts."" The new law allocates $1.5 billion to the U.S. Forest Service’s Urban and Community Forestry program, which averages to $150 million a year over the bill's 10-year life. That’s a substantial cash infusion for the program, which has been funded at around $30 million to $40 million per year for the past few years, said Matt Spitsen, program development manager for the Arbor Day Foundation, which promotes tree planting.  Walker said the legislation would raise ""taxes on those making under $200k."" But the tax provisions in the measure are aimed at wealthy money managers and big companies. One of the law’s two major tax elements would significantly scale back a tax-code provision known as ""carried interest,"" which allows money managers to pay taxes on much of their income at capital-gains rates, which are lower than the regular rates for personal income. The other provision would require companies reporting at least $1 billion in profits to pay at least 15% in corporate income taxes, which many currently do not do. An analysis by the congressional bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation found the law would raise taxes, on average, in every income bracket. Overall, the federal tax burden for all Americans would rise by an average of 1.4% in 2023, and by less in future years. For those earning between $30,000 and $100,000, the increase would be less than 1% in 2023.  But there’s an important caveat: The joint committee analysis looked only at the tax side of the bill, not at spending provisions that could offset those tax increases for most families. The latter includes tax credits for people who buy electric vehicles and implement energy-efficiency improvements; multiyear subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act; and a drug-negotiation provision for Medicare. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget concluded that the $64 billion in health insurance subsidies alone ""would be more than enough"" to erase the tax increases for people earning less than $400,000 under the Joint Commission on Taxation’s analysis.  The funding for trees is to be used ""for tree planting and related activities, with a priority for projects that benefit underserved populations and areas,"" according to the bill.  Before the bill’s passage, the U.S. Forest Service program’s budget was spent largely on placing staff in every state to support local urban foresters. The new, expanded budget will allow the program to award grants to local nonprofits seeking to improve tree cover in their geographic areas, Spitsen said. The idea is to ""help cities plant more trees in the places where they're needed most,"" said Jad Daley, president and CEO of the advocacy group American Forests. The national program’s focus on racial and economic justice seeks to direct the bill’s funding to neighborhoods that are low-income and relatively treeless.  ""Across the nation, on average, the lowest-income neighborhoods in America have 41% less tree cover than the wealthiest neighborhoods,"" Daley said. And neighborhoods where a majority of residents are people of color have 33% less tree cover on average, he said. ""Essentially, shade and cooling is distributed according to race and income,"" he said. A jet comes in for approach over downtown Phoenix as temperatures exceed 100 degrees in the morning hours. Phoenix officials are planting thousands of trees to lower temperatures. (AP) Supporters cite several benefits from expanding tree cover. One major benefit is reducing mortality from heat. Between 1999 and 2010, 8,081 people died in the United States from heat-related deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About three-quarters of those deaths were primarily because of heat, and in the rest, heat was a contributing factor.  That’s about five times the number of deaths from hurricanes over the same period, even counting the unusually high death toll from Hurricane Katrina in 2005. And it was about 12 times the number of deaths from tornadoes over the same period. More recent data from a University of Pennsylvania study found even higher numbers for heat-related deaths: an estimated 13,000 to 20,000 between 2008 and 2017. ""The allocation of funds to tree planting in cities can have an immense impact on heat risk,"" said Brian Stone Jr., an urban environmental planning and design professor at Georgia Institute of Technology. Stone said his research found that in combination with other strategies, planting trees in Atlanta ""can reduce heat-wave mortality by more than 20%."" Trees also ease carbon levels in the atmosphere. Trees, like all plants, store and immobilize carbon dioxide, which is a key driver of climate change. Daley said it’s estimated that 130 million metric tons per year of carbon dioxide are being stored in trees and forests. ""So it's a really big slice of the natural climate solution,"" he said. Tree-planting is ""a meaningful contribution to actually pull carbon dioxide out of the air."" Finally, trees help save money on cooling. Research published by the U.S. Forest Service suggests that, on average, urban trees and forests help decrease residential electricity use by 7.2% annually. That produces savings in utility costs and also reduces emissions from power generation.  Walker said, Biden and Warnock ""are spending $1.5 billion on ‘urban forestry’ and raising taxes on those making under $200k to pay for it."" Walker is correct about the amount being spent on efforts to bolster urban tree cover, but he exaggerated when he said the bill will ""raise taxes"" on middle- and lower-income Americans.  Analyses that reached that conclusion looked only at the tax provisions in the bill. The spending provisions could offset those increases, or surpass them, by saving Americans money on green improvements, Affordable Care Act premiums and prescription drug costs",Half True,"September 1, 2022"

""Water has always been considered a precious commodity, but Stan Meyers’ invention may make it even more valuable. He has developed what he calls a water fuel cell,"" the interviewer says in the segment. ""It has taken the place of his old gas tank.

Iterations of this claim have been debunked numerous times by fact-checkers (such as here and here) and debunked across the board. ""Water cannot be burned as hydrocarbon fuels (petrol, ethanol, natural gas) or hydrogen,"" Hua Zhao, vice provost and dean of the engineering college at Brunel University London, told Agence France-Presse in 2019. Zhao said the hydrogen atoms in water molecules are bonded to oxygen atoms and it would take energy (typically by electrolysis) to release these hydrogen atoms so they could be burned as motor fuel. ""The energy required to break those bonds between hydrogen and oxygen in water will always take more energy than the energy needed to get them together in a fuel cell or produced by the engine,"" Zhao said. Meyer, who had no formal scientific experience or credentials, died of a brain aneurysm in 1998. He claimed that his ""water fuel cell"" worked by taking the water and breaking itf hydrogen and oxygen and that the hydrogen could be used to fuel a car engine. Meyer’s claim seemed to defy thermodynamic principles. The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can’t be created or destroyed, and that when it’s transferred from one form to another, the final state can't be greater than the original state. ""Water is not a fuel. It never has been one, and it never will be one,"" longtime science writer Philip Ball wrote in 2007 for the London-based scientific journal Nature. ""Water does not burn.

"Another continent may exist beneath Antarctica, which is also home to homicidal sea creature of unknown origin","There could be another continent below Antarctica. Not only that, but a giant squid-like creature lurks nearby, deep in the Antarctic Ocean, at least according to a blog called ""Alien News"".  And there’s more: The creature has already killed three scientists — and Russian intelligence knows the secret behind it all.  So says the supposed news blog shared in an Aug. 24 Facebook post stating, ""Russia tells the world that Antarctica Is NOT what (it) seems."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) First, let’s consider the claim that a ""brand-new species"" of squid, referred to in the article as ""Organism 46B,"" purportedly living far beneath the ice shelves of Antarctica and preying on a team of Russian scientists trying to study it.  The earliest mention we could find of the so-called ""Organism 46B"" is a September 2012 satirical news story by author C. Michael Forsyth. He wrote for Weekly World News, which published fictional news stories from 1979 to 2007 that centered on paranormal themes and American folklore.  Forsyth’s article was republished on a personal blog page, where it’s clearly labeled fictitious. It describes ""a highly intelligent octopuslike creature that claimed the lives"" of three Russian scientists who discovered it. In reality, Antarctica, which is Earth’s most southerly continent and whose gargantuan and sprawling ice shelves contain about 80% of the world’s freshwater, is home to various lesser-known critters, including krill, crustaceans and, yes, really big squids — but no squid that has ever been known to prey on humans. We’re referring to the aptly named colossal squid, aka Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni, described by the nonprofit marine-life advocacy group, Oceana, as a ""massive squid that lives in the deep sea surrounding Antarctica"" and is ""the largest invertebrate on Earth.""  Colossal squid can measure up to nearly 50 feet long and weigh more than 1,000 pounds, according to Oceana. But colossal squid do not emit any kind of poisonous venom that paralyzes their prey. They have tentacles ""covered with suckers that are equipped with strong, sharp hooks, used in both capturing prey and fighting off predation,"" the Museum of New Zealand says on its website. It’s unknown how many of the creatures exist, as sightings are exceedingly rare, considering the squid live thousands of feet below the Antarctic Ocean’s surface and have been found as far as the southern waters of New Zealand, according to the museum.  In searching news archives, we also found no mention of fatal attacks carried out on humans by this particular species of squid. As for the other claim that another continent exists beneath Antarctica, evidence-based science tells us that’s impossible. Andrew Campbell, a University of Chicago geophysics professor, explained why in a PolitiFact interview once before: The planet’s total mass has a far greater density than its crust alone, coming in at 5.5 grams per cubic centimeter on average (counting all the mass of the planet) compared with 2.7 grams per cubic centimeter on average for rocks in the crust. If Earth were hollow and there were a civilization below the crust, the planet’s mass would need a lower density than the rocks in the crust. And that’s just not the case. A Facebook post suggested another continent may exist beneath Antarctica, which is also home to homicidal sea creature of unknown origin referred to as ""Organism 46B."" ""Organism 46B"" is a fictional creature. And there is no evidence of  ""another continent"" beneath Antarctica",False Pants on Fire,"August 30, 2022"
"""We also know (the Sierra Club) paid for those reporters"" at the Palm Beach Post.","Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Nikki Fried falsely claimed reporters who examined her policies on sugar cane burning were paid by environmental activists.  Fried's comment followed the publication of a 6,000-word investigation by The Palm Beach Post into Fried's promise as agriculture commissioner to make ""historic changes"" to sugar cane harvesting.  The Post's Aug. 11 report found that her changes to the state's burn program failed to address the health risks people in Palm Beach County may face because of pollution. It also noted that Fried's political committee receives contributions from groups largely funded by the sugar industry. The sugar industry's practice of burning acres of cane fields is a harvesting technique to rid the plant of its tough outer layer, according to the Post. Fried went beyond simply dismissing the story when a reporter covering one of her campaign events asked her about its findings. She said the Sierra Club, an environmental group, wanted her to ban sugar cane burning. ""The Sierra Club had one mission and one mission only,"" Fried said in Tallahassee on Aug. 14. ""It's unfortunate they didn't recognize all the other tremendous achievements our department made."" When pressed further, she said: ""We also know they paid for those reporters.""  It's not unusual for a politician to say unfavorable coverage is inaccurate or biased. But Fried's claim suggested journalistic corruption.  PolitiFact found no evidence to support Fried's accusation. The commissioner's office said it would not answer specific questions about the claim. Her campaign did not return multiple requests for comment.  When we asked the Post about Fried's claim, Executive Editor Rick Christie said none of the reporters, photographers or editors assigned to the latest investigation were paid by an outside entity, let alone the Sierra Club. ""It is unfortunate that the agriculture commissioner felt the need to initiate and propagate an outright falsehood,"" Christie said. ""We stand by our reporting."" Fried's comments were criticized by other Post reporters who called her rhetoric ​​""dangerous."" Fried elaborated on Twitter after the campaign stop: ""It's something I've heard — hope it's not true."" She did not clarify where she heard the allegation. Fried's office only pointed to an Aug. 15 article by the Capitolist to support her claim. The Capitolist is a business and politics website with a questionable relationship with the state's largest power utility, Florida Power & light. Consultants hired by Florida Power & Light bought a controlling stake in the website ahead of the 2020 election, the Miami Herald reported. Articles were also revealed to be pre-screened by the consultants.  Florida Power & Light used the Capitolist to ""settle scores and bend the will of regulators, politicians and the public,"" the Herald wrote.  The Capitolist article Fried cited linked to its criticism of a 2021 investigation into sugar cane burning that the Palm Beach Post published in partnership with ProPublica, a nonprofit investigative news site. As part of its Local Reporting Network, ProPublica provides grants to local news organizations for specific investigative journalism projects. A ProPublica grant funded the Post's 2021 investigation.  In July 2021, the Capitolist said that the Post partnering with ProPublica for the investigation amounted to ""a troubling and obvious controversy."" It also attempted to link ProPublica to the Everglades Foundation, a group working to restore the Everglades. The Capitolist said both ProPublica and the Everglades Foundation received funding from the Knight Foundation, a longtime funder of journalism, communities and the arts.  Robin Sparkman, ProPublica's president, told PolitiFact that funders don't have a say in which organizations the publication partners with and which stories it investigates.  ""They see our stories when the public sees them,"" Sparkman said. ""Additionally, we have never solicited or received funding from The Sierra Club or The Everglades Foundation."" The Capitolist reported that the Everglades Foundation invested in the Sierra Club, but it did not establish a credible connection between the Sierra Club and the Post. The Sierra Club also denied paying for press coverage of sugar cane harvesting. ""There is absolutely no truth to Commissioner Fried's statement,"" said Patrick Ferguson, organizing representative for the Sierra Club of Florida. Fried said the Sierra Club ""paid for those reporters."" There's no evidence for Fried's claim. The Palm Beach Post and Sierra Club rebutted Fried's accusation about the newspaper's coverage of sugar cane burning.

Says Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson “called climate change ‘bull----’ during a record heatwave” and “raked in over $700k in fossil fuel cash.”,"With passage by Democrats of a new measure aimed squarely at tackling climate change, the issue is taking on a new urgency in the fall election. Those who opposed the measure, including U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., are being targeted by environmental groups and others. That includes the claim of using an expletive to dismiss climate change, and pulling in campaign money from oil and gas companies. In an Aug. 13, 2022, tweet, the League of Conservation Voters took aim at Johnson, saying he ""called climate change ‘bull - - - -’ during a record heatwave"" and ""raked in over $700k in fossil fuel cash."" Let’s take a closer look at both parts of that claim.  Caught on camera  So did Johnson make light of climate change?  While speaking to the Republican Women of Greater Wisconsin on June 5, 2021, Johnson’s speech did, in fact, turn to climate change.  ""I don’t know about you guys, but I think climate change — as Lord Monckton said — bull - - - -,"" Johnson said, based on a video of the luncheon. He was referring to Lord Christopher Monckton, a noted British climate change skeptic, and mouthed the expletive before adding aloud: ""By the way, it is.""  Legions of scientists have researched climate change and determined it is real, with its impact seen in heat waves and drought in some areas, and rising sea levels in others.  When asked later about his comments by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Johnson tried to soften the remark a bit, saying that he is not a climate change denier, nor is he a climate change alarmist.  ""Climate is not static,"" he said. ""It has always changed and always will change.""  But the bottomline: Yes, Johnson was caught on video referring to climate change that way.  So, what about the second part of the tweet? Exactly how much has Johnson gotten from the oil and gas industry?  When we asked for backup for the claim, David Willett, senior vice president of communications for the League of Conservation Voters, said the information came from OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan nonprofit research group that tracks money in politics.  According to OpenSecrets, Johnson has taken $753,247 from the oil and gas industry since 2009. That period covers Johnson’s entire tenure in office, since he first won election in 2010. The site does not further break down how that money was spent on Johnson. It doesn’t say whether the money was directly contributed to Johnson’s campaign or whether other groups spent it on his behalf, such as for ads against opponents during an election.  Included in the donors to Johnson is Koch Industries, which does some work in the oil and gas industry. Donors affiliated with the company have contributed about $67,000.  As a point of reference, Johnson is far from the top recipient of donations by the industry.  U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, has received more than $8 million in donations during his time in office, while U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, has taken over $4.1 million.  In fact, Johnson doesn’t even crack the top 20 recipients in Congress of oil and gas industry donations, according to OpenSecrets. Neither is the oil and gas industry the largest contributor to Johnson, according to OpenSecrets. Over the years, securities and investment, real estate and manufacturing have been some of the largest industry donors. The League of Conservation Voters claimed Johnson ""called climate change ‘bull - - - -’  during a record heatwave"" and ""raked in over $700k in fossil fuel cash."" Both parts of the claim check out, from a much-publicized comment made at a luncheon in 2021 to publicly available campaign contributions, as organized and analyzed by a reputable nonpartisan group.  Indeed, Johnson has actually received more than $750,000 from the oil, gas and energy industry since the 2010 election, though it’s far from his biggest source of money — and he’s far from the top recipients in Congress",True,"August 19, 2022"
"""Bill Gates and AOC say that a cow emits more pollution than a car.""","Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., have talked in the past about the pressing need for governments and corporations to take climate change seriously, including the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the agriculture industry. One Facebook post took this a step further by claiming the two said ""a cow emits more pollution than a car."" The post features an image of Gates and Ocasio-Cortez with a cartoon illustration of a cow. Underneath the image is text that makes a reference to using an idling car in an enclosed space for carbon monoxide poisoning. ""How bout I spend the night in a garage with a cow, and they spend the night in a garage with a running car,"" text underneath the image reads. ""Then we can meet up the next morning to discuss."" Variations of the claim have popped up elsewhere on social media. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The emissions coming from a cow and those from a car are not one in the same. A cow produces methane gas when partially digested food like grass is fermented within the rumen, one of a cow’s four stomach compartments. That gas is built up during fermentation and expelled by the cow through belching and, occasionally, flatulence. Cars with internal combustion engines primarily produce carbon dioxide as a byproduct when fuel is burned to provide energy. A single cow will expel an average of 220 pounds of methane per year, according to the University of California, Davis. Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency reports that a typical car will emit an average of 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. Methane gas is nearly 30 times more potent than carbon dioxide when it comes to contributing to climate change, UC Davis reports. Despite methane's potency, it only lasts for about 12 years in the atmosphere before a majority of it is removed through oxidation. Experts at UC Davis theorize that it’s possible the amount of methane that cows emit into the atmosphere is the same as the amount that breaks down. As for carbon dioxide, the university said it can last anywhere from several hundred to a thousand years in the Earth's atmosphere before breaking down. Meaning the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will continue to build up more and more in the atmosphere and will take centuries before disappearing. There are an estimated 253 million passenger cars and trucks within the U.S., with about 1.8 million of them being electric powered. The U.S. has around 91.9 million head of cattle.  A spokesperson for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation told PolitiFact Gates has never said anything about cows producing more pollution than cars. Although a representative for Ocasio-Cortez’s office did not return a request for comment, we could not find any public remarks or written statements similar to the claim in the Facebook post made by the congresswoman. However, both have talked in the past about the link between the agriculture industry and climate change. Gates published a research paper in October 2021 detailing the need to make green technologies more affordable and accessible than their carbon-emitting counterparts. He mentioned in the report that livestock contributed 6% of global greenhouse gas emissions while passenger cars emitted 7%. Gates has also previously talked about the possibility of developed nations transitioning entirely to eating synthetic beef to help reduce the need for livestock, thereby lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Ocasio-Cortez briefly came under fire in 2019 when an FAQ shared by her office regarding the Green New Deal, a proposed resolution she co-sponsored to help address climate change, included a line about ""farting cows."" ""We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast,"" the FAQ said. The mention of ""farting cows"" did not appear in the resolution itself. The resolution also mentioned the need to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, but makes no comparison to the emission of cars with those of cows. Similar to Gates, Ocasio-Cortez has also advocated for the need to eat less meat and dairy products as a way to help address climate change. She’s made statements about it on social media and in an interview on the canceled Showtime series ""Desus & Mero."" ""It’s not to say you get rid of agriculture. It’s not to say we’re going to force everybody to go vegan or anything crazy like that,"" she said on the show. ""But it’s to say, listen, we’ve got to address factory farming. Maybe we shouldn’t be eating a hamburger for breakfast, lunch and dinner."" A Facebook post claims Gates Ocasio-Cortez said cows emitted more pollution than cars. Although both have talked about climate change in the past and the roles that fossil fuels and livestock play in greenhouse gas emissions, neither have said anything resembling the claim in the Facebook post. The methane emitted by cows is more potent in contributing to climate change, but it breaks down in the atmosphere considerably more quickly than the carbon dioxide from cars",False,"August 15, 2022"
Electric cars in California are not sustainable as only 10% of their batteries are recyclable and the state can’t recycle them.,"As part of his $10 billion zero-emission vehicle plan to fight climate change, California Gov. Gavin Newsom wants to phase out gasoline-powered cars in favor of electric powered ones by 2035. And President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, passed Aug. 7 by the U.S. Senate, would give Americans a tax credit of up to $7,500 to defray the cost of buying an electric vehicle. But an Instagram post claims difficulty with recycling lithium-ion batteries, the fuel cells in electric vehicles, will render this push toward zero-emission vehicles impractical. A video posted June 9 and shared by others features a woman talking about California officials advocating for more renewable energy and for residents to drive electric cars. The woman makes several claims, including that the push for more electric cars is not a ""sustainable solution"" as there isn’t a plant in California that can recycle their batteries once they die. ""There’s only three (electric car battery recycling plants) in the United States, and they can only recycle about 10% of the materials, which means the balance will go into landfills,"" she says.

The woman was also wrong in her statement about the recyclability of lithium-ion car batteries.  Most electric car batteries last at least 100,000 miles before their ability to hold a charge seriously degrades, according to Carfax. With Americans driving an average of 13,476 miles each year, that translates to at least seven years of reliable service. Most batteries will go for significantly longer than the initial 100,000 miles before dying. The first major wave of electric car batteries dying off is expected to happen within the next 10 to 15 years, the BBC reported. Unlike lead-acid batteries, which are small and easily recyclable, electric cars use battery packs that are larger and composed of hundreds of individual lithium-ion batteries. The hazardous materials within a battery pack can spark a fire or explode if handled or disposed of incorrectly. Also, California lacks an electric car battery recycling plant; there are only five such facilities currently operating in the U.S. However, Alissa Kendall, a UC Davis civil and environmental engineering professor, told PolitiFact that California not having a recycling facility was a ""particularly irrelevant"" point, as there are ""many things we recycle or process in the U.S. economy that don’t have a site in every state."" Kendall said Nevada-based Redwood Materials launched an electric car battery recycling program in California in February and partnered with California car dealerships and battery dismantlers to collect lithium-ion batteries. The batteries will be sent to Redwood’s recycling facility in Nevada. Kendall was the lead author of a California Environmental Protection Agency report in May that said electric car battery recycling was a relatively new, but growing industry.The report also made several recommendations to the California Legislature for improving  electric car battery recycling. Meanwhile, there are several ways  to recycle electric car batteries, all of which reclaim significantly more material than the 10% the Instagram video cited. One method is through smelting, which melts a battery down at a high temperature until its materials separate from one another. Because this method requires a lot of greenhouse gas-producing energy but recovers only about 40% to 50% of a battery’s material, it’s less widely used, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported.. The other two recycling methods, which are more widely used, involve shredding lithium-ion batteries into small pieces. A shredded battery can be recycled directly, by removing and separating its parts by hand, or through hydrometallurgy, in which the batteries' pieces are submerged in a solution and chemically separated. These shredding methods can recover up to 90% to 95% of a battery’s components. Kendall said lithium-ion batteries’ worst-case environmental impact  would still be less than  fossil fuels’.  ""While we certainly can improve mining practices and recycling systems for every material and product in our economy, there are very few measures whereby oil and gas extraction and refining are less harmful than lithium extraction (for electric car batteries),"" she said. A woman in an Instagram video claims California’s push for electric cars is not sustainable in part because California does not have a recycling facility that can handle the lithium-ion batteries in cars and that the recycling facilities in the country can recycle only 10% of the batteries’ material.  While California so far has no lithium-ion battery recycling plant, the California Environmental Protection Agency report said lithium-ion battery recycling is still a fairly new industry with room for growth. Also, companies from other states are partnering with California to recycle its batteries. Furthermore, current recycling methods can recover from half to up to 95% of the material used lithium-ion batteries, far more than the post’s claim of a 10% recovery rate",False,"August 11, 2022"
“We have more oil and gas permits than ever before right now.”,"While Republicans argue that the United States needs to do more drilling for oil and gas to deal with rising energy prices, Wisconsin U.S. Senate candidate Mandela Barnes, a Democrat, has a different perspective on the matter. During discussion of the transition to renewable energy in a recent primary debate, Barnes said: ""This is not a light switch. This is turning the dial. And the fact is, we have more oil and gas permits than ever before right now. We need to focus on that transition to renewable energy."" Let’s dial in on that third sentence. Do we really have more oil and gas permits than ever before? In response to a request for supporting information, the Barnes campaign shared a Yahoo News article from March reporting that oil and gas permitting in the United States has increased under President Joe Biden’s administration. The article relies upon a data dashboard of onshore oil and gas leasing and drilling under the Biden administration from the Center for Western Priorities, a nonpartisan conservation and advocacy organization focusing on the American West. The dashboard, originally published on March 8, 2022, was updated July 21. It mostly relies on data from the U.S. Department of Interior’s Office of Natural Resources Revenue and the department’s Bureau of Land Management, which is the agency responsible for approving oil and gas drilling permits on public land. Since Barnes said ""permits"" and not ""leases,"" we will focus on the former.  For context, oil and gas companies must obtain a lease for land they want to drill on before applying for a permit. Permits usually expire after two years, but the agency can grant extensions. We’ll start by noting the earliest available permit data tracked by the BLM is from 2010 — so that provides a very limited window for a most-ever claim like the one Barnes made. We’ll also look at the data in two ways — permits that are approved but unused, and all permits. According to the dashboard, as of March 2022, companies held nearly 9,000 approved, but unused, drilling permits. A Bureau of Land Management spokesperson confirmed this, saying that the number of such permits peaked at the end of fiscal year 2021 at 9,623. (The fiscal year ended Sept. 30.) That is the highest total in the last decade.  According to the BLM, the total number of approved but unused drilling permits was at 7,091 at the end of fiscal year 2020. As of May 2022, that total was at 8,920 permits. But what about the total number of existing permits, not just those that are currently unused? An analysis of data from the BLM’s online database shows the number of existing permits has dramatically increased since calendar year 2016, as more permits have been issued and the expiration dates of already issued permits have been extended. Indeed, the number of existing permits also peaked in 2021 at 16,096. Meanwhile, there are 14,427 overall permits so far in 2022, a number that could increase as the year continues. The above data only takes into account onshore oil and gas drilling – not any offshore operations, where oil and gas are extracted from below the Outer Continental Shelf.  Offshore drilling is managed by the U.S. Department of Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which is responsible for leasing, and its Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, which is responsible for permitting. An analysis of that data, which goes back to 1996, shows the number of approved permits for new wells peaked in 2006 at 381. The number of approved permits has steadily declined since then — likely a result of legislative pressure at the state and federal level to restrict offshore drilling due to environmental concerns. So, the offshore data would have only a small impact on the overall picture. And that picture is one where Barnes is right on the current number, and may well be right on the historic one. But the data is too limited for him to make such a sweeping claim. During a debate, Barnes said ""we have more oil and gas permits than ever before right now."" The Bureau of Land Management confirmed that the number of approved but unused onshore drilling permits reached 9,623 at the end of fiscal year 2021, the highest it’s been in the past decade. The problem is there is no available earlier data, which would really be necessary to make such a sweeping claim",Mostly True,"August 9, 2022"
"You can't pour water on flames from an electric car battery because “water makes lithium burn.""","Electric vehicles have received widespread praise from climate activists and President Joe Biden, but some social media users are not sold.  One user lobbed a barrage of criticism against such vehicles in a lengthy Facebook post shared thousands of times.  ""The problem with crashing any (electric vehicle) is that if you are trapped, you're dead, as it is impossible to remove victims,"" reads the July 22 post. ""Also can't put a battery fire out. Water makes lithium burn."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This isn’t a new line of criticism in opposition to electric vehicles. Variations of the post have surfaced elsewhere on Facebook. It takes a lot of water to extinguish an electric vehicle fire, but the suggestion that it would cause such a blaze to burn further is wrong. Lithium-ion batteries, which are used in electric cars, have been used in smaller electronic devices, including cellphones, laptops and electric toothbrushes, for years. All batteries, including lithium-ion batteries, use positive and negative electrodes and an electrolyte solution, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. What makes a lithium-ion battery more difficult to extinguish is its use of a highly flammable organic electrolyte, Reuters reported. U.S. authorities have conducted a substantial amount of research on how to extinguish lithium-ion batteries. In 2013, the Fire Protection Research Foundation — sponsored by the U.S. Energy Department — found that water can be used to put out a burning lithium-ion battery. However, it requires copious amounts to complete the task. It took more than 2,600 gallons of water to extinguish one of the battery test fires carried out by the researchers. That's almost enough to fill a 12-foot round swimming pool. Further, the report found that ""the use of water does not present an electrical hazard to firefighting personnel."" There are also real-world examples of how such fires were extinguished. In 2021, NBC reported that when a Tesla caught on fire after it crashed in Houston, it was extinguished with water — 28,000 gallons, to be exact.  The Facebook post’s sweeping assertion that water can’t be used to extinguish a fire from an electric vehicle is inaccurate",False,"July 29, 2022"
"""Plankton in the Atlantic Ocean is 90% gone.""","Sea life has been struggling for years because of pollution, overfishing and climate change. A now deleted Instagram post claimed the world’s oceans are in even more trouble.   The July 21 Instagram post featured an image of the ocean with superimposed text that read ""Breaking: Plankton in the Atlantic Ocean is 90% gone."" ""In what could be the most disturbing news in ocean conservation, if not human, history — data reveals worse than expected state of plankton (the foundation of life on earth) with a 90% drop in the Atlantic, driving another nail in the coffin of our dying ocean,"" the text continued. The Instagram post cited a study released by the Global Oceanic Environmental Survey Foundation, or the Goes Foundation, a Scotland research group that  measures plankton levels in the Atlantic Ocean. Howard Dryden, a marine biologist and the study’s lead author, was quoted in the Instagram post’s caption saying the Atlantic Ocean was ""pretty much dead."" Similar posts have popped up elsewhere on social media. Scientists have since questioned the study’s validity and the Goes Foundation’s data gathering methods. Dryden has said news outlets and social media have misinterpreted the study.   The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Instagram is owned by Facebook. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Plankton come in two groups: phytoplankton and zooplankton. Phytoplankton are plantlike organisms often found near the water's surface. They can absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. Zooplankton are animals that include creatures as small as krill and as large as a jellyfish. They stay in deeper waters during the daylight to avoid predators and rise up to the surface at night to feed on phytoplankton.  The Instagram post took its information and Dryden’s quote from a story about the foundation’s study in a story published July 17 by The Sunday Post, a Scottish newspaper. The Post's story originally had the headline of ""Our empty oceans: Scots team’s research finds Atlantic plankton all but wiped out in catastrophic loss of life,"" and said the study found a majority of Atlantic Ocean plankton had disappeared over two years because of pollution from toxic chemicals and microplastics. However, the article did not say that the study collected samples from a limited part of the Atlantic Ocean at 15 degrees north latitude, and that the foundation’s findings have not been peer-reviewed. Dryden told PolitiFact there was a ""breakdown in communication with The Sunday Post,"" and that the newspaper has since updated its story clarifying the scope of the foundation’s study. ""What should have been said was that there has been a 90% decline in the equatorial Atlantic, not the whole Atlantic,"" Dryden said. ""This is still a major finding, because it could mark the beginning of the spread further afield."" The Goes Foundation described its plankton and pollution survey as an ""ongoing Citizen Science project"" involving 13 sailing vessels, one manned by researchers for the foundation and 12 others crewed by sailors given monitoring equipment. The crews used custom paper filters to collect water samples. Scientists would later analyze the filters to see whether plankton were in the water. The crews involved in the survey found only a minuscule amount of plankton. Dryden said the foundation's findings ""should be verified by a second independent study,"" and that the organization is working on getting its findings peer-reviewed, although that could take two years.  He said the organization felt it had to make the information public as soon as possible because ""it is so important for the survival of the oceans and climate change."" Oceanographers and marine biologists contacted by PolitiFact disagree with the study’s methods and findings, saying they have not observed a 90% drop in plankton around the equatorial Atlantic Ocean, or anywhere else. Mark Ohman, a biological oceanographer at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, said the study ""does not even begin to meet the standards of peer-reviewed science."" He said the study’s sampling method was ""not an appropriate way to take quantitative plankton samples"" and led to unreliable results because: The study didn’t specify when and where the samples were taken in the Atlantic, which would affect how much plankton was in the water, Ohman said. And the study failed to highlight plankton’s importance in ocean food webs and in regulating the Earth’s climate and oxygenating the atmosphere, he said. ""This study makes no contribution to understanding of any of those key processes, is rife with distortion and misunderstanding, and completely lacks credibility,"" Ohman said. There have also been no widespread changes to the plankton levels in the Atlantic Ocean, said David Johns, head of the Continuous Plankton Record Survey, which was established in 1931 to measure and monitor the ecological health of marine plankton. ""We have analyzed over a quarter-million samples from over 70 years of sampling, and have categorically not seen the declines reported by Dryden, and do not agree with his results,"" Johns said. Ohman said there has been no drop in overall zooplankton populations in the northeast Pacific Ocean, and a rise in phytoplankton. The Continuous Plankton Record Survey works with a large network of scientists around the world. None of the scientists has reported seeing the same declines mentioned in the Goes Foundation survey. There have been some plankton population declines that can be attributed to climate change, but not water pollution as mentioned in the survey, Johns said. ""A reduction as mentioned in Dryden’s report would not only be catastrophic, but also immediately obvious,"" Johns said. ""No plankton, no food for higher trophic levels such as fish, whales, filter-feeding shark and seabirds."" An Instagram post claimed 90% of plankton in the Atlantic Ocean had vanished. The post based its information on a study by the Global Oceanic Environmental Survey Foundation that claimed water samples it took in a part of the Atlantic Ocean showed the dramatic reduction. The organization said its findings could not be applied to the entire ocean, only the specific area from which the samples were taken. However, marine biologists and oceanographers have several issues with the organization’s sampling method and findings and say they have not seen a dramatic drop in the plankton population. In some cases, these experts say, plankton have been increasing. If such a dramatic drop in plankton occurred, it would have a disastrous impact on marine life that would have already been observable",False,"July 27, 2022"
"""If every person on earth just recycled, stopped using plastic straws, and drove an electric car, 100 corporations would still produce 70% of total global emissions.""","If you're on the climate doom side of the internet, you may have seen claims that blame 100 corporations for producing 70% of all the harmful emissions that are driving climate change, otherwise known as greenhouse gas emissions. ""If every person on earth just recycled, stopped using plastic straws, and drove an electric car, 100 corporations would still produce 70% of total global emissions,"" says a 2021 tweet from self-described socialist @GoodPoliticGuy that was shared on several other accounts.  These social media users aren't the first — and they probably won't be the last — to place the majority of the climate change burden on 100 companies. The claim originates from a widely shared 2017 report from Climate Accountability Institute, a nonprofit advocacy group and the nonprofit charity Carbon Disclosure Project. Headlines from The Guardian, CNBC, Fortune and more claiming 100 companies are responsible for 71% of all emissions quickly followed. But the report found that 71% of global industrial greenhouse gases can be attributed to 100 companies from 1988 to 2015. Keyword: industrial, which represents a part of total global emissions, but not all of them. Total global emissions account for the greenhouse gases that are released from food production, burning gasoline, deforestation, oil production and more. The study focused on just the carbon dioxide and methane emissions from fossil fuel and cement production, which still make up a majority of global atmospheric greenhouse gases. It's wrong to suggest that consumers don't factor in global warming. Research shows the human activities driving climate change the most are from heating buildings, electricity use, agriculture, farming and fossil fuel-burning facilities and vehicles. The original study did not include emissions from land use, land use change or forestry, or from sources such as landfills, agriculture and farming. It also did not include data on indirect emissions, which come from purchased energy such as heating and electricity, citing concerns about double-counting emissions attributable to corporations. The study relied on data collected by the Carbon Majors Database, which focuses on greenhouse gas emissions data from the largest company-related sources. In other words, The data derives from records of carbon dioxide and methane emissions relating to fossil fuel (oil, gas and coal) and cement producers dating back to 1854. Richard Heede, the Climate Accountability Institute's director and the study’s co-author, leads the Carbon Majors Database. It contains operational and product-related carbon dioxide and methane emissions related to 100 fossil fuel producers, aka the ""carbon majors,"" which include ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, Chevron, Peabody and BHP Billiton. It’s difficult to discern how much total global emissions can be attributed to the top 100 polluting corporations, but there are ways to get a ballpark idea.  If you use the total global emissions calculated by the Climate Analysis Indicators Tool, an average of around 60% of global emissions can be traced back to those 100 companies from 1990 to 2015. But CAIT's research includes emissions from agriculture, land use and electricity that wasn't considered in the 2017 study. If you use the total global emissions excluding land use and land-use change and forestry emissions from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, then an average of around 63% of those emissions can be traced back to those 100 companies from 1988 to 2015. But Potsdam's research includes nitrous oxide and F-gases — fluorinated gases used in industrial applications — and considered only fossil fuel-related carbon dioxide and methane emissions. Heede said in an email to PolitiFact that his recent research — not yet published — indicates that the emissions the study considered (carbon dioxide and methane from fossil fuels and cement production) account for 70.4% of total human-made emissions from 1988-2018. That could mean that about half of total global emissions can be traced back to those 100 companies. But the timelines are not equal, and it's not peer-reviewed. There are many ways to categorize where greenhouse gas emissions come from, such as by country, by economic sector or, in Heede's research, by corporation. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is the United Nations body responsible for human-induced climate change data and the internationally trusted source for global emissions statistics. The panel divides total human-made greenhouse gas emissions into different economic sectors, including ""industry."" That's not to be confused with Heede's definition of ""industrial greenhouse gases,"" which includes all fossil fuel use and cement process emissions. Additionally, the 71% figure from the study that focused on 1988 to 2015 has become outdated. Heede said recent research from the Global Carbon Project now attributes 69.5% of global fossil fuel and cement emissions from 1751 to 2018 to the top 100 fossil-fuel producers. So, 100 corporations are not responsible for 71% of total global emissions. The study found that 71% of global fossil fuel and cement emissions can be attributed to 100 companies, and Heede was intentional with careful wording.  Heede also said direct emissions that come from company operations, such as extracting and refining oil, typically account for around 12% of a ""carbon major"" company's total emissions. The other 88% comes from the consumption of the products. For example, Chevron, the top emitter of U.S.-tied fossil fuel companies, directly emits harmful greenhouse gases when it explores new areas to drill oil or when it refines that oil into gasoline. But of the approximate 48,267 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent Chevron emitted from 1965 to 2018, around 42,474 of it (or 88%) is estimated to come from the cars burning gasoline, the airplanes burning fuel, etc. ""I hold the companies accountable for producing and marketing harmful products and for deceptively perpetuating the carbon age for fun and profit,"" Heede said. Climate activists have used the study to push for tighter emissions regulations and counter the argument of increased individual responsibility, like cutting out plastic straws or driving electric vehicles. Heede is doubtful either of the climate activists' calls will be answered. Without regulations forcing corporations to produce less, there is little reason to believe consumers will reduce their consumption enough to dramatically slow climate change. ""It is unlikely that human behavior will change enough to avert serious climate damages,"" Heede said. ""We love our stuff, we love to eat high on the food chain, we keep getting into wars over resources, we like the way we live: big houses, big cars, lots of material goods. Yet only a fraction of U.S. emissions are within our immediate control."" Retrofitting houses to be more energy- and carbon-efficient, driving an electric car and composting waste can help, Heede said, ""but industry and commerce and landfills and transportation will still have a large carbon footprint."" An Instagram post claimed, ""If every person on earth just recycled, stopped using plastic straws, and drove an electric car, 100 corporations would still produce 70% of total global emissions."" No, 100 corporations do not produce 70% of total global emissions. The 2017 study that is often cited found that 100 corporations could be attributed to 71% of fossil fuel and cement emissions. The difference between the two claims is in the denominator of the corporation emission equation: it's not all emissions, just industrial greenhouse gas emissions from 1988 to 2015. Research that accurately compares the total global emissions to the data collected from the 100 most-polluting corporations worldwide does not exist yet. The study tied emissions from consuming ""carbon major"" products to the companies that produced those products. So, in theory, everyone driving an electric car would create less demand for gasoline and decrease companies' emissions",False,"July 22, 2022"
Images of Plymouth Rock prove sea levels are not rising.,"Legend has it that, upon arriving in North America, the Pilgrims stepped off the Mayflower onto the large boulder that now sits in a place of prominence on the Plymouth, Massachusetts, waterfront.  Plymouth Rock is a well-known tourist attraction, but its connection to early U.S. history is unproven. And despite what some social media users have claimed, the landmark cannot be used to disprove that sea levels are rising. An Instagram user shared a July 17 meme about the rock that read, ""Plymouth Rock, 2022 still at sea level.""  On July 12, a Facebook user shared another meme featuring two pictures of Plymouth Rock side by side, one labeled ""1620 at sea level"" and the other ""2022 still at sea level.""  (Screengrab from Facebook.) The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) These Plymouth Rock memes do not prove that sea levels remain unchanged; the posts are false and misleading. There is no evidence the rock proudly displayed under the portico in Plymouth today is the exact place where Pilgrims first disembarked the Mayflower in Plymouth, much less that it was found at sea level. (The Pilgrims first landed in Provincetown, Massachusetts, on Nov. 11, 1620. The Mayflower anchored in Plymouth Harbor a few weeks later.) There are two primary accounts of the Pilgrims’ Plymouth landing, but ""both simply say that the Pilgrims landed. Neither mentions any rocks in their account of the landing,"" said Plymouth’s Pilgrim Hall Museum’s website. ""The first references to Plymouth Rock are found over 100 years after the actual landing."" The National Museum of American History site refers to the story of the Pilgrims landing at Plymouth Rock as ""oral tradition,"" and said no contemporary accounts of the landing mention a rock. Plymouth’s tourism website said in 1741 an elder identified Plymouth Rock as the exact landing spot. Although the veracity of the elder’s claim is unknown, Plymouth Rock ""quickly became an American icon,"" the site added.  Visitors stand in a pavilion while looking at Plymouth Rock, in Plymouth, Massachusetts, on Nov. 18, 2018. (AP) Once the boulder was identified as Plymouth Rock, its nomadic history began. ""In 1774, a team attempted to move the rock from shore and place it next to Plymouth’s liberty pole in the town square,"" said the National Museum of American History. ""Before it could be removed from the beach, it accidentally broke in two.""  One part of the rock remained in place; the other piece was moved to the town square.  More than 100 years later in 1880, ""the two pieces were reunited back on the shore and cemented together,"" the National Museum of American History said. In most images of the rock, it is easy to see where it was fused back together. Pilgrim Hall Museum’s website said ""1620"" was also cut into Plymouth Rock in 1880.  In 1920, the rock was moved again, when Plymouth’s waterfront was redesigned and the shoreline was rebuilt, according to Pilgrim Hall Museum’s site. The rock has also been underwater before, during extreme weather and exceptionally high tides called king tides.

Pilgrims would have got their feet wet landing on #PlymouthRock today. @ericfisher @Plymouth_400 pic.twitter.com/DxgQQXxu3J Furthermore, experts said the rock is not a useful landmark for measuring sea level changes. Michael Oppenheimer, a Princeton University professor of geosciences and international affairs, said a single, stationary object ""anchored in bedrock and free of tectonic activity"" can sometimes be used to measure local sea levels.  ""But all it can indicate is local sea level, not ‘sea levels’ generally or the global mean rise,"" Oppenheimer said. Local sea level rise can significantly differ from the global mean sea level rise because of land sinking or tectonic activity, he said.  Gary Griggs, a University of California, Santa Cruz, professor of earth sciences, said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been tracking sea levels relative to land in Boston, near Plymouth Rock, for 100 years. These records show that sea levels have risen about 11.4 inches in the past century.  Satellite data, which has been used to measure sea level rise since 1993, indicates an average rate of global sea level rise of about 13.9 inches per century, Griggs said. That rate is accelerating; over the past decade, the rate has increased to about 19.7 inches per 100 years, he said. ""This is relatively simple science, and there are no alternate interpretations or facts,"" Griggs said. ""Sea-level rise is directly connected to a warming climate. The warmer the planet gets, the more sea water expands, and the more ice melts, all adding to sea level."" Oppenheimer also said global mean sea levels are rising annually and that the rise is accelerating. ""There is no doubt about this,"" he said. Rising sea levels cause problems, some of which have already begun, Oppenheimer said.  ""So-called nuisance or fair-weather flooding has increased in frequency, meaning that high tides now flood streets on a regular basis along the coast in many states — up to 10 times as frequently as 50 years ago,"" he said. ""Furthermore, in large coastal storms, flood risk is increasing as water penetrates inland further and to higher elevation."" There’s no proof that Plymouth Rock was at sea level when it might have welcomed the Pilgrims in 1620. The rock has also moved several times in the past 400 years and is sometimes submerged during high tides and extreme weather. Experts said that Plymouth Rock is not useful for evaluating sea level changes. That sea levels are rising, however, is undisputed",False,"July 20, 2022"

""Each week, drought experts consider how recent precipitation totals across the country compare to their long-term averages,"" the National Integrated Drought Information System’s website said. ""They check variables including temperatures, soil moisture, water levels in streams and lakes, snow cover and meltwater runoff. Experts also check whether areas are showing drought impacts such as water shortages and business interruptions.""  There’s no evidence that these organizations are lying about droughts in the U.S, as the post suggests. But we found numerous news reports in which farmers and others reported drought-related setbacks and changes. One California farmer told CNN he didn’t have enough water to plant crops on all his land, so he stopped growing asparagus and sweet corn. BBC reported that another farmer in California said he didn’t have enough water to plant his usual tomato crop. In Arizona, a farmer told CNBC he’d stopped growing cotton, which requires more water, to focus on corn, wheat and alfalfa.  In 2021, the severe drought in the West drained reservoirs, reducing hydropower plants’ output. Power production was down 25% at the Hoover Dam in Nevada, one of the largest hydropower generators in the U.S., The Associated Press reported. Compared with a 10-year average, California hydropower plants generated 48% less electricity in 2021 — and the outlook in 2022 is worse, per MIT Technology Review.  Houseboats sit in the drought lowered waters of Oroville Lake, near Oroville, Calif., on April 19, 2022.

Since 2000, the flow of the Colorado River has declined almost 20%, the Los Angeles Times reported. Researchers attribute 42% of the extended drought in the Southwest since 2000 and 19% of the severe 2021 drought in the Southwest to human-caused climate change, The Washington Post and CNBC reported. Some places have set regulations to conserve water, but there’s no evidence these actions are tied to efforts to reduce food supplies and control Americans. A Facebook post claimed that ""drought is a lie"" designed to limit farming, reduce the food supply and ultimately control Americans. There is no evidence to support this claim, which the post links to unsubstantiated conspiracy theories. Data shows that more than 50% of the contiguous United States was in drought as of July 12",False Pants on Fire,"July 19, 2022"
Studies show plastics can help combat climate change.,"Plastics can help fight climate change? The perplexing statement was recently made on Facebook by America’s Plastic Makers, a U.S. plastics producer that says its mission is to end plastic waste with modern materials. ""Studies show #plastic can help combat climate change,"" the post says. ""Researchers found using plastic in packaging and consumer products can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to many alternative materials.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) America’s Plastic Makers is run by the American Chemistry Council, an industry trade association for U.S. chemical companies, and is one of the leading producers of plastic in the U.S. The group’s post links to a page on its website that says decades of analysis shows plastics are strong and lightweight, thus requiring less material than steel, paper, aluminum and glass. The group says that replacing plastics with these materials, in many cases, would ""significantly increase greenhouse gas emissions."" But this oversimplifies a complex issue about plastic packaging's benefits versus its negative impacts on the marine environment and human health. Many studies have found that plastic significantly contributes to climate change because of the high carbon dioxide emissions that occur at every stage of its life.  Plastics are made from raw materials like natural gas, oil or plants, which are refined into ethane and propane before being treated with heat, turning them into ethylene and propylene.  These materials combine to create different polymers, which look like powdered laundry detergent. That’s melted down, cooled and eventually molded to make products like water bottles, food packaging, auto parts, medical devices and more. This process — which includes the extraction and transportation of oil and gas, as well as the steps to refine the plastic — emits millions of metric tons of carbon dioxide every year. In its report, America’s Plastic Makers uses various life-cycle studies — a methodology for assessing environmental impacts associated with the different stages of a product, process or service — from 2011, 2016 and 2018. Those studies suggest that plastic can perform the functions of paper or glass, but with less material and less weight, leading to less production energy and greenhouse gases. The benefits of lightweight material are legitimate, but plastics still have negatives. Primarily, American consumers use so much plastic that it still has a large negative impact on the environment.  A May 2019 report called ""Plastic & Climate: The Hidden Costs of a Plastic Planet,"" by the Center for International Environmental Law, found that the manufacture of plastics is particularly greenhouse-gas intensive. In 2015, emissions from manufacturing ethylene were 184.3 to 213 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, about as much as what 45 million vehicles emit during one year. Then there’s the repeated disposal of plastic packaging, via landfill, incineration or recycling. Incineration has the largest climate impact. U.S. emissions from plastics incineration in 2015 were 5.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.  Because plastics are so common and so easily disposed of, it’s not especially realistic to compare their environmental impact to other materials.  ""This topic is indeed more complicated than the (American Plastic Makers) report suggests,"" said Rob Jackson, an earth systems professor at Stanford University. ""I’m reminded of the common question, ‘Paper or plastic?’ The right answer is whatever you already have, so long as you reuse it."" Finally, researchers have found that plastics have a large negative impact on the earth’s oceans. The ocean acts like a huge sink for global pollution, with tons of plastic dumped in waters around the world every year. Hundreds of thousands of marine animals get entangled in plastic waste each year and ingest and suffocate on plastic products they mistake for food. Studies evaluating how plastics impact marine environment and human health acknowledge that the material is cheap, strong and durable, and offers benefits to humanity, but say that waste management practices and human behavior have created a real problem. Plastics do not biodegrade but they do eventually break down under sunlight and fragment into small particles, called microplastics. One 2012 report published in Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology said that 267 species in the marine environment are known to have been harmed by plastic entanglement or ingestion. Scientists suspect that ocean pollution is an important but insufficiently understood component of global pollution that poses serious threats to human health and well-being. Matthew Kastner, director of media relations for the Chemistry Council’s plastics division, acknowledged the danger of ocean pollution but also said the press has made exaggerated claims about plastics and greenhouse gas emissions. ""This is a short social media post intended to help correct the record,"" Kastner told PolitiFact. ""We 100% agree that plastics do not belong in the ocean or anywhere in the environment."" All this presents a complicated choice in terms of deciding what to choose for packaging, researchers say. ""What is clear is that we need to reduce plastics production while ensuring that any alternatives do not contribute more to climate change, and this is where recycling comes in,"" a 2020 analysis by the Imperial College of London says. ""The emissions reductions from eliminating the need for new plastic outweigh the slightly higher emissions that come from processing wastes to recover plastics."" America’s Plastic Makers claimed on Facebook that plastic can help combat climate change. It’s true that some studies have found that plastic packaging is less environmentally damaging than alternatives like glass and paper, but this doesn’t negate plastics' negative impact on human health and marine environment.  Instead of assessing which packaging to use, researchers said the focus should be on ramping up recycling and reuse practices. The topic is more complicated than the post suggests",Half True,"May 26, 2022"
The U.S. government’s inaction over buffalo killing that harmed Native American populations in the 1800s shows it is now “is creating food shortages” so that Americans are more “dependent on the government.”,"Concerns about the country’s food supply are weighing heavily on many Americans as baby formula is hard to find and international conflict threatens commodities like wheat in some parts of the world. A social media post invoking those fears harks back to U.S. history to suggest that the government is purposely creating food shortages. ""In 1873 the U.S. government killed 1.5 million buffalo to starve Native Americans so they would become more dependent on the government,"" read one such May 11 post. ""Fast forward to today, and the government is creating food shortages to achieve exactly the SAME goal!""  It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post has a point about why so many buffalo were killed in the late 1800s, but it makes an unfounded comparison: There’s no evidence the U.S. government is currently creating food shortages. In the mid-1800s, more than 30 million buffalo roamed the plains; by the end of the 19th century, only a few hundred remained.  The rapid population decline was due to overhunting, which was welcomed by U.S. officials as a way to force Native Americans in the Great Plains region to settle on reservations. Andrew Isenberg, an American history professor at the University of Kansas and the author of ""The Destruction of the Bison,"" said white hunters in the late 1800s likely killed ""far more"" than the 1.5 million buffalo mentioned in the post — a fact federal authorities knew. ""The U.S. federal government did not actively destroy bison in order to starve Indigenous people in the Great Plains into submission,"" he said. ""But the federal government stood by and refused to prevent the wasteful destruction of bison by private white hunters and then welcomed the result of the near extinction of the species: Indigenous peoples’ surrender to the reservation system.""  Bison skulls await industrial processing in Michigan in 1892. (Burton Historical Collection, Detroit Public Library and Wikimedia Commons) Gen. William Sherman, who commanded the U.S. Army in the region, negotiated treaties with groups of Indigenous peoples in the Great Plains in the late 1860s, Isenberg said. The U.S. agreed to allow Native Americans to occupy large parts of the Great Plains ""so long as the buffalo may range thereon in such numbers as to justify the chase."" Not long after those treaties were negotiated, Isenberg said, Sherman wrote a letter saying, ""it will not be long before all of the buffalos are extinct near and between the railroads."" By 1873, welcoming the extinction of buffalo to suppress Indigenous peoples ""had become de facto government policy,"" Isenberg said. In an 1872 report, Interior Secretary Columbus Delano wrote that the buffalo’s disappearance ""must operate largely in favor of our efforts to confine the Indians to smaller areas, and compel them to abandon their nomadic customs, and establish themselves in permanent homes."" Although the decimation of the buffalo population was ultimately the work of private hunters, ""the idea that destroying bison was a way to force the surrender of Indigenous people in the Great Plains was quite overt,"" Isenberg said. While there is concern about global food shortages because of the war in Ukraine, experts told PolitiFact in April that the U.S. is less vulnerable to food shortages than poorer nations that rely largely on imports. ""The U.S. food system has a good level of self-sufficiency, so currently, it is hard to imagine empty shelves in grocery stores,"" said Ohio State University agricultural economist Seungki Lee. And though claims have surfaced suggesting the U.S. government is intentionally creating food shortages, we have found there is no evidence to back that up. A number of factors have contributed to the U.S. baby formula shortage, including a recall by a major U.S. manufacturer, existing supply chain issues associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the highly concentrated nature of the formula market.

Millions of buffalo were killed by hunters in the late 1800s as part of a ""de facto government policy"" meant to force Native Americans in the Great Plains to abandon their customs and accept the reservation system. This racist history, however, does not prove that the U.S. government is currently creating food shortages to force government dependence.

“CO2 is not a pollutant.”,"The Republican Party of Virginia recently held a weekend bash at a Dulles hotel to celebrate its sweep in the statewide elections last fall and discuss its agenda. High among its goals is to repeal the state’s Clean Economy Act, a law that commits Virginia to joining a regional cap-and-trade program and achieving 100% carbon-free power by 2050. The law was passed in 2020 when Democrats controlled both chambers of the General Assembly as well as the governorship. The law was labeled ""wokeism"" at a seminar held by the Suburban Virginia Republican Coalition, an Alexandria-based group that says its weekly newsletter reaches 25,000 people. SUVGOP rejects that a climate crisis exists and that man-made carbon dioxide (CO2) is harming the environment. ""CO2 is not a pollutant,"" SUVGOP said in its presentation materials for the April 30 session. The statement contradicts piles of scientific studies showing increasing CO2 levels are contributing to rising temperatures across the globe, the efforts of industrial nations to reduce their emissions, a ruling by the Supreme Court and a statement by the Environmental Protection Agency. Let’s start with a trip back to middle school science, where we learned about  photosynthesis. Plants pull in carbon dioxide through tiny openings in their leaves where it combines with water and sunlight to create sugar, producing oxygen as a byproduct.  It may be hard to imagine something as life-sustaining as CO2 could be so damaging, but it’s what’s called a greenhouse gas. Those gasses, which also include methane, nitrous oxide and others,  produce an insulating effect that allows sun rays to enter the atmosphere but not leave after they bounce off the earth’s surface. When fossil fuels - such as oil, gas and petroleum - are burned to create energy, they release CO2. In the U.S., 76% of greenhouse gas emissions are CO2. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased by 47% since the beginning of the Industrial Age and 11% since 2000, according to NASA.  The Supreme Court, by a 5-4 vote, ruled in 2007 that greenhouse gasses fall under the Clean Air Act’s definition of pollutants and can be regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency. (The high court heard oral arguments in February 2022 challenging the ruling but has yet to render a second opinion.)   In 2009, the EPA classified greenhouse gasses - especially from vehicle emissions - as a form of pollution. The gasses ""are the primary driver of climate change, which can lead to hotter, longer heat waves that threaten the health of the sick, poor or elderly; increases in ground-level ozone pollution linked to asthma and other respiratory illnesses; as well as other threats to the health and welfare of Americans,"" the EPA said. Why does SUVGOP reject these findings? We asked Collister Johnson, a senior advisor to the group who led the presentation as well as another one to the state’s Republican party in December 2021. ""I’ve been studying this for a long time,"" said Johnson, who lives in Alexandria and is a former chairman of the Virginia Port Authority and administrator of the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation. ""We breathe in carbon dioxide. The notion that it’s polluting to human beings doesn’t hold up."" Johnson laid out his arguments in a 2020 article for CFACT, a conservative organization that disputes human-made climate change. He accurately noted that CO2 constitutes about four of every 10,000 molecules in the atmosphere - an increase of about one CO2 molecule since the mid-20th century.  ""Most importantly, the theory of man-made global warming does not pass the sniff test – the test of common sense,"" Johnson wrote. ""It simply does not follow common sense to believe that an increase of one human-caused atmospheric CO2 molecule out of ten thousand over eighty years should result in the ruination of the planet. Johnson’s logic, a talking point among climate-change doubters, is widely dismissed by climate scientists. They say the important point is that CO2 levels are increasing - not that they still compose a tiny part of the atmosphere.  ""It shouldn't be surprising that a small amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can have a big effect,"" wrote Jason West, a professor of environmental sciences and engineering at the University of North Carolina. ""We take pills that are a tiny fraction of our body mass and expect them to affect us."" Vickie Connors, an assistant professor at Virginia Commonwealth University’s Center for Environmental Studies, wrote in an email, ""The argument that common sense has any role to play in determining the ultimate outcome from our unabated release of fossil fuel emissions into our thin envelope of atmosphere is outrageous in this era of global data sets, measurements of temperature increases from any altitude above the surface to the tropopause, in the surface and upper layers of the oceans, in the upper soil horizon, in the measured melting [of] sea ice, glaciers, and snow at high elevation and polar latitudes."" Johnson has also noted that CO2 levels were once 10 times higher than they are today and ""animal life thrived and prospered."" But scientists told us that occurred before humans existed. ""‘Pollution’ is a term that is somewhat human-centric,"" John Reilly, co-director of the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, wrote in an email. Kevin Trenberth, distinguished scholar at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, sent us an email labeling the CO2 claims by Johnson and SUVGOP ""misleading rubbish."" SUVGOP, in a presentation at a meeting of the state Republican Party, said ""CO2 is not a pollutant."" The statement contradicts piles of scientific studies showing increasing CO2 levels are contributing to rising temperatures across the globe, the conclusions of almost all climate scientists, a ruling by the Supreme Court and a statement by the Environmental Protection Agency",False,"May 12, 2022"
“New York state has already lost 99% of its historic freshwater wetlands.”,"New York state Sen. Sean M. Ryan, who represents a district that runs north and south of Buffalo, recently wrote an op-ed that urged increasing conservation protections for wetlands.  ""New York's wetlands are important to nearly every living being in our state,"" Ryan wrote in the op-ed, which originally appeared on March 3 on the website of the conservation group Ducks Unlimited. ""They provide critical habitat for species like ducks, deer, and turkeys – and you may already know that they are home to nearly half of the threatened and endangered species in the state."" Ryan added that other benefits of wetlands range ""from absorbing flooding and storm surge, to filtering water of pollutants and acting as one of the most effective carbon sinks,"" which helps mitigate climate change. In the op-ed, Ryan outlined the scope of wetland losses in recent decades.  ""Despite all of these benefits, our wetlands are constantly under threat,"" Ryan wrote in the op-ed. ""New York state has already lost 99% of its historic freshwater wetlands."" The 99% figure seemed high, so we checked with Ryan’s office. Cody Meyers, Ryan’s chief of staff, acknowledged to PolitiFact New York that the figure was mistaken. Meyers said the 99% figure referred to the percentage of wetland habitat losses since 1600 in New York City, rather than New York state. After we contacted Ryan’s office about the percentage, they changed the figure in the op-ed to 60%, where it remains. But what about the 60% figure? Is it accurate? The figure stems from a 1991 report titled, ""Wetlands: Status and Trends in the Coterminous United States, Mid-1970s to Mid-1980s."" The report was co-authored by two specialists with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a federal agency. The report determined that New York state had lost 60% of its wetlands by the end of the 1980s. It was one of 22 states that had lost at least half of their wetlands by then, the report said. The 60% figure also appears in another federal report from 1990, ""Wetlands: Losses in the United States, 1780s to 1980s."" However, these reports are more than 30 years old. In fact, in his op-ed, Ryan acknowledges the difficulty of using old data: He writes that one of the shortcomings with current state wetlands law is that it only protects wetlands ""12.4 acres and larger that appear on a set of jurisdictional maps. These maps were created in the 1970s and 1980s with outdated technology, leading to nearly 1 million acres of wetlands lacking any state-level protection."" So we checked with independent experts to see if any more recent data existed. Tom Langen, a professor of biology at Clarkson University, told PolitiFact New York that he wasn’t aware of any comprehensive studies in the last two decades.  One study published in 2000, ""Wetlands Status and Trend Analysis of New York State Mid-1980’s to Mid-1990’s,"" found a net gain of 17,619 acres of wetlands from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s in five geographic zones in New York state. The gains were largely due to farmland abandonment, beaver proliferation, and restoration efforts.  However, these increases accounted for less than 1% of the state’s existing wetlands acreage, They also didn’t encompass the entire state, making it hard to draw broader conclusions. Overall, Langen said, he’s doubtful that there’s been a substantial change from the 60% figure.  Nicholas A. Robinson, an emeritus professor of law at Pace University who specializes in environmental law, agreed that it’s unlikely that there’s been a significant change in wetland cover since the studies in the early 1990s, and that 60% is likely still a safe figure to use.  The scale of historical losses is so significant, Robinson said, that ""measures are needed to curb that rate of loss."" Ryan said, ""New York State has already lost 99% of its historic freshwater wetlands.""  New York state has not lost 99% of its wetlands. Ryan’s office acknowledged that they had mistakenly used the figure for New York City, and they changed the figure to 60% after we inquired. The 60% figure dates back to federal studies published in the early 1990s. That means their data is more than 30 years old. However, the limited studies that have been conducted since then have found only modest changes in wetland cover, and several experts said they do not expect that the percentage of wetland loss has changed dramatically during the past three decades",Mostly False,"March 29, 2022"
"“As soon as Biden took office, he eliminated all subsidies for fossil fuels.”","On his web show, conservative commentator Bill O’Reilly took President Joe Biden to task for policies he said have encouraged higher gasoline prices. One of the reasons that gasoline prices have recently reached record levels in raw dollars, O’Reilly said March 15, is that ""as soon as Biden took office, he eliminated all subsidies for fossil fuels."" Days after entering office, Biden did issue an executive order telling federal agencies to curtail certain subsidies for fossil fuels over which the executive branch had control. However, these changes only affected a modest slice of all fossil fuel subsidies. The bulk of such subsidies can only be overturned by congressional action, not unilaterally by Biden. O’Reilly did not respond to questions submitted through his website for this article. Biden announced his executive order on Jan. 27, 2021. It addressed a range of policies related to climate change, including efforts to curb fossil fuel subsidies.  Specifically on subsidies, the executive order said that federal agencies needed to ""take steps to ensure that, to the extent consistent with applicable law, federal funding is not directly subsidizing fossil fuels."" Various analyses of the executive order have pointed to at least two types of subsidies that would be at risk under Biden’s order. One involves a tax deduction for payments of environmental penalties by fossil fuel companies. Another involves federal funding for the construction and maintenance of shipping infrastructure typically used by fossil fuel producers. However, in his remarks at the event to unveil the executive order, Biden indicated that the order would not, by itself, end all fossil fuel subsidies. ""Unlike previous administrations, I don't think the federal government should give handouts to big oil to the tune of $40 billion in fossil fuel subsidies,"" Biden said. ""And I'm going to be going to the Congress asking them to eliminate those subsidies."" There is no clear figure totaling up the annual cost of fossil fuel subsidies, because the industry and environmentalists have long disagreed on what qualifies as a subsidy. However, the lower end of published estimates suggests an annual figure of $20 billion, roughly two-thirds of which comes from federal policies and one-third of which comes from state policies. Despite Biden’s executive order, ""the lion’s share of federal subsidies remain in place,"" said Sujatha Bergen, director of health campaigns at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. In the White House’s proposed fiscal year 2022 budget, Biden urged Congress to end a number of subsidies, including tax deductions, that benefit the industry. He put these in his proposed budget because tax law cannot be rewritten by executive order, only by an act of Congress. One of the items Biden’s budget targeted was the foreign oil and gas exemption. This allows companies to shield themselves from taxation for the refining and transport of fossil fuels generated overseas. Backers of ending this exemption say that denying this tax break would save $85 billion in lost revenue over 10 years. Another subsidy is a tax deduction for ""intangible drilling costs."" This century-old provision allows independent fossil-fuel companies to immediately deduct the costs associated with exploration and development  from drilling a new well. This is estimated to cost taxpayers $13 billion over 10 years. A third tax break is known as ""percentage depletion."" It allows independent fossil-fuel companies to deduct 15% of their gross income from production. This break costs an estimated $13 billion over 10 years. Biden’s proposed budget would also reinstate expired Superfund excise taxes on crude oil, petroleum products and untaxed crude oil, potentially generating $38 billion in federal revenue over 10 years. Other proposed cuts in the Biden budget addressed tax breaks for ""enhanced oil recovery"" and for ""oil and gas produced from marginal wells."" However, proposals like these to curb fossil-fuel subsidies have not advanced in Congress, even to the point of formal consideration by committees. A Senate bill sponsored by Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has attracted only seven co-sponsors. A House bill sponsored by Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., has 41 co-sponsors. And a House bill sponsored by Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., has 11 co-sponsors. In the Build Back Better Act, Biden and his allies proposed more than $100 billion in cuts over 10 years, Bergen said. But that bill has languished in the Senate. ""Congress tried to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies this session but oil and gas industry allies blocked progress,"" Bergen said. ""We are hoping that Congress will move forward with those in the next iteration of legislation."" O’Reilly said, ""As soon as Biden took office, he eliminated all subsidies for fossil fuels."" Biden did sign an executive order just days after taking office that required federal agencies to get rid of fossil fuel subsidies they had unilateral control over.  However, a large majority of subsidies can only be undone with the assent of Congress, and while Biden and congressional Democrats have urged Congress to do that, they have not been successful yet",Mostly False,"March 17, 2022"
"Says President Joe Biden ""is trying to send taxpayer dollars to manufacturers overseas that do not abide by the same (carbon emission) standards we do at home.""","The ""America First"" doctrine was a central part of Republican President Donald Trump’s administration, with some lawmakers rallying around Trump’s approach to international relations, including skepticism of international organizations and trade deals.  Now, with Democrat Joe Biden in the White House, U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Wisconsin, argues the opposite is happening when it comes to efforts to address climate change..  In a Feb. 3, 2022 tweet, Grothman said: ""The US has made strides in reducing carbon emissions that other parts of the world have not. Meanwhile, @POTUS is trying to send taxpayer dollars to manufacturers overseas that do not abide by the same standards we do at home."" We previously checked the first part of the claim, on the U.S. making progress even as some other countries have not, and rated it True. For this fact check, we are focused on the second part of the claim: Biden trying to send taxpayer dollars overseas to high-pollution countries. Is Grothman right? In this case, China – the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases – plays a key role, particularly as it relates to some of the products being boosted by Bidens plan. When asked for backup, Grothman’s staff cited an Oct. 22, 2021 Solar Reviews article that stated two-thirds of all solar panels are made in China, and an April 17, 2021 CNBC report that said China also dominates the rare mineral market. (According to the U.S. Geological Survey, in 2019, China was responsible for 80% of rare earths imports.)  This is what the CNBC report had to say about their importance and use: ""Once extracted from mines, rare earths are shipped to separation facilities, where they are separated from other minerals. Then rare earths are individually separated into oxides, metals and finally magnets that are used in everything from missiles to wind turbines, medical devices, power tools, cellphones and motors for hybrid and electric vehicles."" Grothman’s team connected that dominance by China with Biden’s stalled Build Back Better plan, which includes increases in energy tax credits for solar, wind, geothermal, waste, fuel cell, and energy storage technologies.  The implication is that subsidies for the purchase of solar panels, and other items that include rare earth minerals, means that tax dollars would be on the way to Chinese manufacturers. This is where Grothman’s claim runs into problems.  First, in its phrasing – ""trying to send"" – the claim suggests a primary objective of the Biden plan is to send the money overseas.  That ignores the fact the Build Back Better plan includes a ""Made in America"" provision to make products manufactured here a priority, as well as a plan to help make the U.S. a player in the rare earths supply chain. Indeed, ""Made in America"" has been a hallmark of Biden’s presidency. For instance, in his March 1, 2022, State of the Union address, Biden declared: ""There’s been a law on the books for almost a century to make sure taxpayers’ dollars support American jobs and businesses. Every Administration says they’ll do it, but we are actually doing it. We will buy American to make sure everything from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on highway guardrails are made in America.""  That’s all great in theory. But how does it work in practice? Abdur Chowdhury, professor emeritus in economics at Marquette University, noted that ""in global geopolitics, you cannot always achieve what you want.""  ""As China controls the global supply of rare earth minerals, it is true that some U.S. taxpayer dollars would go to high polluting nations like China, India,"" Chowdhury said. ""So the U.S. has to participate in various global climate change negotiations in order to force these countries to reduce environmental pollution."" He added: ""Withdrawing from the international discussion and negotiation on a number of environmental issues is not the answer. The U.S. can and should use its leverage to force countries to reduce environmental pollution.""  For our purposes, we’re left with a claim that overstates the intent and effect of Biden’s proposal, particularly in the way a reader would likely understand it.  The taxpayer money would not go directly to China. But based on the use of rare earths, China would derive a secondary benefit from increased spending on wind turbines and other products bolstered by Biden’s plan. Grothman claimed Biden ""is trying to send taxpayer dollars to manufacturers overseas that do not abide by the same (carbon emission) standards we do at home."" That is certainly not the intent of the Build Back Better plan, which includes ""Made in America"" provisions and efforts to guard against this happening. But economists note that China’s dominance in rare earths, for instance, means they would benefit from the spending as well",Half True,"March 11, 2022"
"""The US has made strides in reducing carbon emissions that other parts of the world have not.""","In 2018, 15-year-old Greta Thunberg sparked a worldwide movement to meet carbon emissions targets when she protested outside the Swedish parliament holding a sign saying ""School Strike for Climate."" That protest inspired students across the globe to hold similar demonstrations demanding action from their governments on climate change. The issue remains at the forefront, though measures to address climate change are stalled in Congress. Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Wisconsin, took to the floor of Congress to stake out a view that he says is rarely heard – that the United States is already doing a better job than the rest of the world at addressing the issue.  In a Feb. 3, 2022 tweet that included a snippet of the floor speech, Grothman made this claim: ""The US has made strides in reducing carbon emissions that other parts of the world have not. Meanwhile, @POTUS is trying to send taxpayer dollars to manufacturers overseas that do not abide by the same standards we do at home."" In an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, Grothman expanded on the comment. ""I feel that many young people are being misled into thinking our country is polluting more than it ever has,"" Grothman said. ""In reality, air and water pollution have decreased significantly in the last 40 years. I also feel that given the growth of the Chinese and Indian economies, people in the U.S. have to be conscious that changes in our laws can inadvertently push jobs to these other countries who do not have the same environmental standards we do."" Both parts of Grothman’s claim caught our attention. We took a look at the overseas manufacturers claim and rated it Half True.   But what about the claim on carbon emissions and progress.  The claim is that the U.S. is ahead of ""other parts of the world"" in terms of the strides it has made. Admittedly, the ""other parts of the world"" is a bit vague, but we interpret it to mean the US is doing better than many other countries that – like it – are among the largest emitters of greenhouse gases. When asked for backup, Grothman staffers pointed to a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency report titled ""Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2020.""  The report said that CO2 – carbon monoxide – emissions from fossil fuel combustion fell by 8.4% in that 30-year period. Looking at just the 15-year period of 2005 to 2020, they fell 24.7%. (In the final year covered, from 2019 to 2020, the figure was 10.7%) So, U.S. emissions have fallen, but Grothman stated that as a comparison to other parts of the world, so we need to look broader. Researchers with the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm focused on global trends, have tracked that data back decades. Their data puts China as the world’s top emitter, followed by the United States. The data groups the European Union as one, in addition to listing its individual nations such as Germany. According to the data provided, here are the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitters for the years 2010 and 2019, with total net emissions in million metric tons of CO2e (bundles of greenhouse gases):                                               2010           2019           Percent change China                         11,235        14,093          +25.4% U.S.                              6,241         5,724           -8.2% India                             2,504          3,422           +36.6% European Union           3,868         3,334           -13.8% Brazil                            2,124         1,458          -31.3% Indonesia                      1,113          1,765         +58.5% Russia                           1,335           1,619          +21.2% Japan                             1,232           1,142          -7.3% Germany                           923               771         -16.4% Canada                             665               707         +6.3%  So when compared to the world’s top greenhouse gas emitters, the United States has made progress, decreasing emissions 8.2% from 2010 to 2019. China and India saw the biggest increases among those countries, 25.4% and 36.6%.  Of note: Brazil made the most progress for that time period among the top 5 emitters, with a decrease of 31.3%. However, by 2020-2021, as The New York Times reported Nov. 2, 2021, Brazil’s progress has stalled and the country is now seeing increasing emission levels, largely driven by a surge in deforestation.  Grothman said ""The US has made strides in reducing carbon emissions that other parts of the world have not.""  When compared to the world’s other top greenhouse gas emitters, the United States has made progress – its emissions falling 8.2% from 2010 to 2019. While the US is not tops in terms of decreases, Grothman’s claim was a relative one. And China and India are among countries that have seen increases, not decreases",True,"March 11, 2022"
"""Bill Gates hatches 'horribly stupid' plan to block out the sun""","Bill Gates has been falsely accused of many villainous plans, from depopulating the Earth to pushing microchips as part of all medical procedures. Now, a recycled claim says Gates’ aims go even higher — literally. ""Bill Gates hatches 'horribly stupid' plan to block out the sun,"" says the headline on a Feb. 21 article on the Daily Star website. The article was shared on Facebook and was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Gates did not personally hatch a plan, nor is he — or anyone — scheming to block out the sun. The claim first surfaced in 2021 and has been previously debunked by multiple fact checkers. The falsehood centers on a small-scale experiment that Harvard researchers proposed — called SCoPEx, short for Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment — that would spray aerosols into the atmosphere to reflect some sunlight back into space, a technology aimed at minimizing global warming. It’s called solar radiation management, or solar geoengineering. ""Geoengineering is a blanket term for technologies that try to alter Earth’s physical qualities on the largest scale possible,"" Popular Mechanics reported. ""One example is cloud seeding, where airplanes flush clouds with particulate matter in order to coalesce into rain."" Solar geoengineering involves using technology to try to reflect solar radiation back into space before it can interact with greenhouse gases. The most commonly proposed method is to use aerosols — ""the gaseous clouds formed by particles of many common materials"" — because the physical structure of their particles blocks and scatters light, according to Popular Mechanics. The claim that solar geoengineering is an effort to ""block out the sun"" is inaccurate; the technology is a riff on a naturally occurring process. Already, about 30% of the sun’s energy is reflected back into space by clouds and ice, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental nonprofit group. But solar geoengineering is controversial, even according to the Harvard researchers who proposed the experiment. For one thing, the methods could have unintended consequences on global weather patterns. The proposed Harvard experiment would use a high-altitude balloon to lift instruments into the atmosphere and release aerosols. The small-scale experiment is ""to test the risks and efficacy"" of solar radiation management, the researchers said, and to gather information that cannot be obtained through computer modeling and lab work. As Popular Mechanics noted, ""(A)ll of the scientists and backers involved are only suggesting doing research—not taking large-scale action."" Gates’ only connection to the research is through his donation to Harvard’s Solar Geoengineering Research Program, which is providing part of the funding for the project. Gates, who dropped out of Harvard in 1975 to co-found Microsoft, has provided funding to the university for climate research since 2007. The article shared in the Facebook post also falsely claims that the experiment will ""kick off in June."" The project originally was scheduled to have a test flight in Sweden in June 2021, but a Harvard advisory committee delayed it until at least 2022 in order to study potential impacts. An article headline says, ""Bill Gates hatches 'horribly stupid' plan to block out the sun."" Gates did not create such a plan. He is among the donors to a program that’s funding a small-scale experiment proposed by Harvard researchers that would spray aerosols into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight back into space. The experiment would measure the risks and effectiveness of the technology and is not an effort at widespread implementation",False,"February 25, 2022"

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The examples cited in the post are part of a conspiracy theory that claims that the condensation trails behind aircrafts are ""chemtrails."" Some people believe that chemtrails are a ""secret, large-scale atmospheric spraying program,"" said a study published in 2016 by the Carnegie Institution for Science, University of California Irvine and the nonprofit organization Near Zero.  But chemtrails are not real, said atmospheric chemists and geochemists surveyed in 2016 by the three organizations. The 2016 study said that ""well-understood physical and chemical processes"" debunk the alleged evidence for chemtrails. The alleged evidence also could be explained by typical airplane contrail formation and poor data sampling, researchers said. Contrail is a shortened term for condensation trails, which are formed by the combination of high humidity and low temperatures ""that often exists at aircraft cruise altitudes,"" according to the Air Force, which has called the chemtrails conspiracy theory ""a hoax."" The Air Force said contrails are composed primarily of water (in the form of ice crystals) and do not pose health risks to humans. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has also debunked the chemtrails conspiracy theory. The agency says it is not aware of any deliberate release of chemicals or biological agents into the atmosphere. People who spread the conspiracy theory cite varying alleged purposes for the chemtrails, including weather modification, chemical or biological weapons testing and manipulating stock prices by damaging crops. In the TikTok clip, Perlingieri mentioned weather modification, and that theory also has been embraced by Alex Jones of InfoWars, who is known for spreading misinformation.  A 1996 research paper from Air University called ""Weather as a Force Multiplier: Owning the Weather in 2025"" seems to have inspired the chemtrails hoax. The paper was about the ""hypothetical harnessing of weather for military objectives,"" according to National Geographic U.K.  But that paper did not ""reflect current military policy, practice or capability,"" the Air Force said.

Images show how climate change destroyed the Greenland ice sheet and harmed a polar bear from 2009 to 2019.,"The 10-years challenge has been making the rounds on Facebook, with users sharing photos of how they’ve changed within the last decade.  A climate change advocacy group got in on the trend by using purported then-and-now photos of a polar bear and an aerial view of Greenland, showing dramatic changes. Climate change is the ""10 years challenge we should really care about,"" the group’s Jan. 12 post said. The image, shared by a Facebook page called Green New Deal, shows two split images: one of the ice on Greenland being heavily diminished and another showing a healthy polar bear in 2009 and an emaciated bear in 2019.    The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) With the ""2009 and ""2019"" time stamps, the post gives the impression that the images depict changes that happened over that 10-year span. That’s not the case. While climate change has affected Greenland’s ice sheet and polar bears, the Facebook post is exaggerated. PolitiFact reached out to The Other 98%, the group that runs the page account, and their CEO John Sellers responded to say they deleted the image from all of their pages. We found similar posts shared across Facebook. A search of NASA images show that the area of land in the picture is Greenland, which experts also confirmed. (Greenland is geographically in North America, but it belongs to the kingdom of Denmark.) The post portrays the huge island’s ice sheet as almost wiped away as of 2019.  Greenland did have record ice loss of 532 billion tons in 2019, according to NASA. The ice loss added 1.5 millimeters to the average global sea level, which NASA said was enough to cover California with 4 feet of water. Still, satellite images taken by NASA that year show it looks nothing like the Facebook post. The image makes ""no sense,"" said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado Boulder. ""It seems to be showing the Greenland ice sheet present day (left) compared to some rendition of what the island would look like without an ice sheet,"" Serreze told PolitiFact.  Serreze said it would be ""many centuries"" at current warming rates before the Greenland ice sheet disappears. The ice sheet makes up 80% of Greenland and is the second-largest ice sheet in the world, behind the Antarctic ice sheet. The picture of the emaciated bear was not actually taken in 2019.  In 2015, a photographer named Kerstin Langenberger spotted the bear in the Svalbard archipelago in the Arctic Ocean east of Greenland and took a photo of it, drawing the conclusion that the bear’s poor condition was due to climate change. Langenberger’s picture garnered media attention, including from the CBC in Canada.  But even a defender of polar bears wasn’t buying it. ""When you get claims that this picture of this particular bear is evidence of climate change then you’ve crossed a bridge too far,"" said Geoff York, Polar Bears International's senior director of conservation, in a CBC interview. Another expert pointed out that it’s unlikely that the images show the same polar bear. Andrew Derocher, professor in the department of biological sciences at the University of Alberta in Canada, said none of the 19 polar bear populations monitored in Alaska, Canada, Norway and Greenland have gone through such a shift in overall body condition within a 10-year period. The skinny bear’s grim condition could have been due to reasons other than climate change, like disease, advanced age and injury.  ""Yes, individuals undergo changes in condition, but an animal (in) such an advanced stage of malnutrition is an extreme situation and not what has been observed on a population level,"" Derocher said. Jennifer Francis, acting deputy director and senior scientist at the Woodell Climate Research Center in Massachusetts, said there are studies, like one published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Climate Change, that indicate polar bears’ health is declining due to rapid sea ice loss. Polar bears use ice to capture sea lions.  But Serreze said there really isn’t a connection between the ice loss in Greenland and the distressed polar bear. ""The issue with polar bear habitat is loss of the Arctic Ocean's floating sea ice cover,"" he said.  A Facebook post claimed to show that within 10 years, climate change has gutted the Greenland ice sheet and caused a healthy polar bear to waste away. The post is exaggerated. Greenland did lose a record amount of ice in 2019, but the loss recorded in satellite images was not what the post suggested. It’s not clear where or how the ""after"" photo was generated. In addition, the picture of the emaciated bear was taken in 2015, not 2019.

Electric vehicles would not have fared well in the Virginia snowstorm traffic jam.,"A major snowstorm in Virginia this week left hundreds of motorists stranded in freezing conditions on Interstate 95, some of them for more than 24 hours. That led a social media user to warn of what would have happened if more of those cars had been electric vehicles. ""Imagine if half the cars in the traffic jam on I-95 in Virginia last night were electric vehicles. And half of those were to run out of battery power,"" A Facebook post on Jan. 4 said. ""All those people would be stuck in freezing temperatures without a heated vehicle. And all the cars would be stuck unable to move because you can’t bring a charging station to them. In effect all those electric cars would become roadblocks to the gasoline powered vehicles. Just something to think about when you hear politicians pushing electric vehicles over gasoline and diesel."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post suggests electric vehicles would have been more prone to failure in such conditions than gasoline-powered cars and trucks. Others raised similar concerns, including a Washington Post columnist, who shared a tweet from a trucker who recounted his experience with a Tesla driver who was worried about running out of power. But are such worries grounded in reality? Many variables affect how a given electric vehicle would fare in such a situation, including the type of battery it has, the heating system it uses and whether the vehicle was fully charged before the trip. But there’s no evidence that EVs generally would be more prone to failure in a traffic jam like the one that happened in Virginia. The range of an electric vehicle varies widely by model, from 110 miles in the Mini Cooper Electric to up to 373 miles in the Tesla Model S. And cold weather can diminish the range of an EV, according to automakers and tests by Consumer Reports.  But when idling, as in a standstill traffic jam, an EV behaves differently from a gas-powered vehicle. An electric vehicle’s motor doesn’t run when the car is stationary, so the only draw on the battery is for the heating system and other electrical accessories. Drivers idling in a gas-powered vehicle would need to keep the engine running, and gasoline burning, to keep the heat on. In December, PolitiFact examined a similar claim that said electric vehicles are more likely to fail in traffic jams in cold weather. We found that to be false because the vehicles don’t use much power while at a standstill or in their climate settings. To understand the energy capacity of an EV’s battery, Peter Wells, director of the Centre for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff Business School in Wales, told PolitiFact that the average U.S. house uses 30 kilowatt-hours of power per day, so a fully charged 62 kilowatt-hour battery in an electric car could power a house for two days. Even half-charged, a 62 kWh battery could yield 10 to 15 hours of heating in a car that’s stationary during a traffic jam, Wells said. A gasoline car’s heating or air conditioning, on the other hand, wouldn’t be able to operate without the engine running and consuming fuel to power the compressor and other parts. Jeremy Michalek, co-founder of the Vehicle Electrification Group and an engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University, said cold weather can cut an electric vehicle’s range, in miles, by as much as half, citing a study he co-authored. But range is a function of a moving car. While idling, a gas-powered vehicle, assuming a full tank of 15 to 18 gallons, could take anywhere from about a day to up to a week to burn through that gas, Michalek said. A stationary Tesla Model 3, he said, could exhaust its battery in as little as eight hours or as much as a few days, depending on the wattage of the heater. So which would fare better stuck in a daylong traffic jam like the one in Virginia? It depends, Michalek said, on how comfortable someone needs to be, whether the car has a heat pump and other factors. ""Bottom line: A gasoline vehicle can keep the cabin warm while idling for a longer period, on average, but in practice it will depend on how much energy is left in each vehicle at the time it is stranded and how efficiently the heating options are used,"" Michalek said. ""For example, electric seats in EVs can be more efficient at keeping an adult body warm than heating the whole cabin in an emergency situation."" It is easier to refuel a car that runs out of gas in a traffic jam than to recharge an electric vehicle, which can take hours, but no car is really built to outlast a 24-hour traffic jam. Dozens of vehicles were left abandoned or ran out of gas in the Virginia jam and had to be towed, the Washington Post reported. An electric vehicle that runs out of battery power on the road would typically need to be towed to  a location where it could be recharged. But some new options are becoming available. Blink Charging Co. in Miami sells a portable charger for use by roadside assistance services to supply EVs with enough battery power to get to a charging station, and Lightning Mobile is developing a mobile electric charging station that it hopes to sell to operators of commercial electric vehicle fleets, according to Automotive News.  A Facebook post implied that a massive traffic pileup during a Virginia snowstorm would have been far worse with more electric vehicles on the road. Cold weather can diminish the range of an electric vehicle that’s moving. But there is no evidence to suggest electric vehicles idling in standstill traffic would have fared any worse than gas-powered vehicles, which need a running engine to provide heat and can run out of gas while idling.  Electric vehicles don’t use much energy while idling, and drivers can use even less by using the seat warmers instead of the heating system",False,"January 7, 2022"

It claims that those species aren’t endangered, but actually on the rise. The Dec. 12 post shows a screenshot of a claim from Patrick Moore, who serves on the board of the CO2 Coalition, an advocacy group that claims to educate people about the benefits of carbon dioxide. Moore tweeted this claim in 2019: ""Polar bears have increased 400% in 45 years; whales are nearly fully recovered; extinctions are down 90% past century (IUCN). Koalas are doing fine. If we could ban wind turbines we could save 85,000 birds of prey/yr in US alone."" Moore describes himself as a Greenpeace co-founder; Greenpeace said in 2010 that Moore ""played a significant role in Greenpeace Canada"" years ago, but denied that he was a founding member.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Agence France Presse first fact-checked elements of the claim two years ago, calling it misleading. Experts we talked to agree that the statistical claims are unsupported.  Here we look at each part of the claim individually: It’s impossible to compare the global population of polar bears to 45 years ago, because scientific estimates for most of the world’s polar bear populations weren’t published until after the mid-1970s, said Andrew Derocher, professor in the department of biological sciences at the University of Alberta in Canada. ""Many of the 19 polar bear populations (e.g., east Greenland, Laptev Sea, Arctic Basin, Kara Sea) have never had a population estimate and lack trend data, so it is impossible to say what the global population was 45 years ago or for that matter, what the global population size is today,"" Derocher said.  Derocher pointed to data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Polar Bear Specialist Group, which published its first estimate in 1993. That year, IUCN’s global estimate of polar bears was 21,470 to 28,370. Its estimates were 22,000 to 27,000 in 1997, 21,500 to 25,000 in 2001, and 20,000 to 25,000 in 2005 and 2009. In July 2021, the global estimate was 26,000.  The threat to polar bear populations 50 years ago was unregulated commercial, sport and subsistence hunting, Derocher said. A 1973 international treaty called the Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears blocked overhunting, Philip Newell, associate director of science defense at Climate Nexus, told PolitiFact.  Today, Derocher said, polar bears face another threat: global warming.  Experts differ on how much climate change has affected polar bears. Charles Greene, senior fellow at Friday Harbor Laboratories at the University of Washington, said the loss of ice in the Arctic Ocean has had some effect on polar bear populations, but not a major one so far. He pointed to two graphs published in 2014 that estimated their population — one showed a modest decline, while the other showed virtually no change. Still, both Greene and Derocher agreed there’s no evidence that polar bears have increased by 400%.  The practice of whaling decimated the whale population over the 20th century, said Greene. He pointed to figures from a pair of studies cited by Our World in Data, showing the whale population dwindled from an estimated 2.56 million in the 1890s to 879,412 by 2001.  While some countries, including Japan and Norway, still allow whale hunting, most have agreed to stop, Greene said. As a result of that and other international agreements, whale populations have recovered somewhat, but they’re nowhere near where they were when whaling was common. ""The thing that prevents them from recovering even faster is that even though we’re not intentionally whaling, we are unintentionally whaling by them getting hit by ships, by them getting entangled in fishing gear,"" said Greene. ""So for many species, blue whales, humpbacks in the Pacific, and right whales in the North Atlantic, those are the main sources of mortality now."" That could be enough to make right whales extinct within a few decades, Greene added. The North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium reported that the whale species’ numbers had dropped to 336 in 2020, the lowest number in nearly 20 years. Moore’s tweet cites the IUCN as a source for his claim that extinctions have dropped 90%. But we found no evidence to support that number, On the contrary, groups tracking biodiversity point to rising threats of extinction over the past century. In 2019, the ​​Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services  said, ""the average abundance of native species in most major land-based habitats has fallen by at least 20%, mostly since 1900.""  The IPBES also reported that since the 1600s, at least 680 vertebrate species have gone into extinction. More than 9% of all domesticated mammals used for food and agriculture became extinct in 2016. The IPBES count of endangered animals included 40% of amphibians, 33% of reef-forming corals, a third of all marine mammals, and more.  The IUCN reports that it has more than 142,500 species on its ""red list"" of threatened species, and more than 40,000 are in threat of extinction.  ""I couldn’t even begin to find anything that would suggest that extinctions have gone down,"" Greene told PolitiFact. ""It didn’t take me very long to go and pull out very recent papers from top tier journals that demonstrate that it’s a totally bogus claim.""  In 2016, the IUCN declared that koalas, which are native to Australia, were on the decline and categorized them as vulnerable. The group listed several threats, including residential and commercial development, logging and wood harvesting, and more.  An IUCN  fact sheet notes that koalas are affected by dangers including elevated CO2 levels in the plants they eat, predatory animals, vehicles, droughts and bushfires, diseases and habitat destruction.   AFP reported in its 2019 fact-check that the exact number of koalas was contested by different experts. But they did agree that koalas were not, in fact, fine. Birds do have deadly encounters with wind turbines. According to a June 2021 study published on the open-access journal Ecosphere, birds of prey with ""relatively higher potential of population-level impacts from wind turbine collisions included barn owl, ferruginous hawk, golden eagle, American kestrel, and red-tailed hawk."" However, wind turbines have a much smaller effect on birds of prey than other risk factors do. In response to a similar 2016 claim from candidate Donald Trump about ""hundreds and hundreds"" of eagles being killed by wind turbines, experts told us that the number of eagles killed was closer to 100, and that the birds could be easily saved with ""proper siting and mitigation measures.""  A 2020 article from Eletrek, a news site focused on sustainable energy and electric transportation, reported that while raptors can be killed by wind turbines, factors like agriculture, deforestation, fossil fuels, climate change, cats and windows have proven to be far more dangerous.  We didn’t find a basis for Moore’s claim that 85,000 raptors a year could be saved. We reached out to him for evidence for his claim in its entirety, but he did not return our query.  A Facebook post shared a 2019 claim that said polar bears’ populations had increased 400% in the last 45 years, whales were nearly fully recovered, that koalas were doing fine, and extinctions fell 90% in the past century. There are issues with each part of the claim. Experts said scientific estimates about the number of polar bears weren’t published until after the mid-1970s, so it’s impossible to compare today’s population to 45 years ago. Global estimates point to a modest decline or virtually no change in polar bear populations in recent decades. There is no evidence that whale populations have nearly fully recovered under whaling restrictions, or even come close. Koalas have been listed as vulnerable since 2016. We found no evidence to support the claim that extinctions are down by 90% in the past century. There have been several reports that wind turbines do kill raptors, but not nearly as many birds as the claim suggests.

"The United States had 589 coal-fired plants 10 years ago, and “we're down to 504. … We are the only nation that has reduced our reliance (on) coal energy.""","As the U.S. and global economies recover from the strains of the coronavirus pandemic, the demand for energy has outstripped supply, sending energy prices higher. With energy prices expected to remain high in the near future, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., called a meeting of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, which he chairs, to hear testimony from experts on energy trends. During a discussion of carbon capture technologies — ways to capture, transport and bury atmospheric carbon dioxide deep underground  — Manchin cited several statistics about the trend lines during the past decade for coal-fired power plants.  Manchin said that China, India, and other major nations have increased the number of coal-fired power plants, while the U.S. has decreased its number. ""The United States had 589 (coal-fired plants) 10 years ago,"" Manchin said during the Nov. 16 hearing. ""We're down to 504. … We are the only nation that has reduced our reliance as far as in coal energy."" We decided to check Manchin’s math. Manchin’s deputy press secretary, Jeremy Ortiz, told PolitiFact West Virginia that the senator was referring to coal plant data from the Global Energy Monitor, a nonprofit group that tracks energy data. The group’s Global Coal Plant Tracker collects data on all coal-fired power plants that generate at least 30 megawatts of power. Manchin’s figure for current coal-fired plants — 504 — is close to one of the figures in the Global Coal Plant Tracker database. However, Manchin used the wrong terminology to describe this number. Data from the tracker show that there are 498 coal-fired units in the U.S., and that’s not far from 504.  But notice what is being counted: units, rather than ""plants,"" which is the word Manchin used. The tracker’s database counts a much smaller number of coal-fired plants in the US. — 246. So what’s the difference? ""​​Units often consist of a boiler and turbine, and several units may make up one coal-fired power station,"" said Flora Champenois, a coal research analyst with the Global Energy Monitor. ""Interchanging the terms for plants and units is inaccurate."" For example, she said, the Clifty Creek station in Indiana is one power plant, but it operates six units. U.S. coal capacity did peak a decade ago at around 340 gigawatts and has declined to 232 gigawatts today, Champenois said. Low-carbon alternatives have increasingly become competitive with coal on price, and the shift away from coal has been reinforced by increased attention among utilities, governments and the public to carbon emissions’ role in driving climate change. Champenois added that while the U.S. has been retiring coal-fired plants at a ""record pace,"" it is not on track to meet the goals set by the Paris Agreement, the global climate accord that the U.S. rejoined earlier this year. Champenois said that the U.S has retired more capacity, measured in gigawatts, than any other country since 2000, which supports Manchin’s assertion that no other country has reduced its reliance on coal for energy as much as the U.S. has. But many other countries have been cutting back, too. China has retired a lot more coal-fired units than the U.S. has, and many of the European Union’s 27 countries have retired a much larger percentage of their existing capacity, Champenois said. The EU has reduced coal consumption by half since 2015, Sean O’Leary, senior researcher at the Ohio River Valley Institute, told PolitiFact West Virginia That said, measuring the impact of these reductions in countries like China and India is tricky. Despite the pace of coal-fired retirements, China, India and the rest of the world have also added coal-fired power units, plants and capacity during the past decade, producing net increases in all three metrics. By contrast, the U.S. has seen decreases in all three. China has been adding non-coal assets at a faster pace than it’s adding coal-fired assets, meaning that coal’s share of its energy portfolio has been declining. ""Although China is increasing generation from coal, coal's share of Chinese generation has been declining since 2010, and China has announced its intention to reduce coal-fired generation starting in 2026,"" O’Leary said. Despite the complexities of measuring the global changes in coal use, O’Leary said that Manchin overstated how unusual the United States’ transition away from coal has been. ""The notion Manchin tried to convey, that the U.S. is alone in cutting reliance on coal while the rest of the world bounds ahead, is just plain wrong,"" O’Leary said.  Manchin said the U.S. had 589 coal-fired plants 10 years ago, and ""we're down to 504. … We are the only nation that has reduced our reliance as far as in coal energy."" Manchin is broadly right to note that the U.S. has decreased its reliance on coal for generating electricity over the past decade, although he incorrectly labeled the units of measurement that went along with his figures. He also has a point that the U.S. has led the world in the number of retirements of coal-fired assets, but it’s worth noting that the U.S. is not alone, as other countries have also made significant cuts in coal-fired power over the same period",Half True,"December 10, 2021"
Electric vehicles are more likely to fail in traffic jams.,"A viral Facebook post suggests that electric vehicle advocates have overlooked a fundamental flaw that would make the cars prone to failure and dangerous to their owners in the event of a massive traffic jam. The post shows a photo of a road packed with vehicles at a standstill and says, ""Imagine all of these vehicles being electric powered. It’s 93 degrees outside. A major accident has rendered going anywhere impossible for hours. People are running their AC until all batteries go dead. You can’t jumpstart these cars and trucks like a gas or diesel powered vehicle. They have to be plugged in until recharged. The brains behind the EV movement don't have this figured out. These folks will die from heat, while in cold weather states, people will freeze to death. What do you say to that, Greta Thunberg?"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post implies that electric vehicles are more susceptible to this type of failure than internal combustion cars. But that misunderstands how EVs and their batteries work. Many variables would affect how an EV performs in the situations described in the post compared with an internal-combustion vehicle, including how much fuel or battery power the vehicles started out with, the size of the engine, the capacity of the fuel tank or battery, and the weather — car batteries don’t do as well in the cold. But there’s one key difference between the two propulsion systems: While an internal-combustion car’s engine stays on and burns fuel while idling, electric vehicles use little battery power when at a standstill.   ""The motor doesn’t consume power at zero speed,"" David Howey, associate professor in engineering science at the University of Oxford’s Department of Engineering Science, told Reuters. ""Only the car electronics and heating/cooling systems use power when the car is stationary, and the amounts are relatively small."" Peter Wells, director of the Centre for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff Business School in Wales, puts it like this: The average U.S. house uses 30 kilowatt-hours of power per day, so a fully charged 62 kilowatt-hour battery in an electric car could power a house for two days. Even half-charged, a 62 kWh battery could yield 10 to 15 hours of heating in a car that’s stationary during a traffic jam, Wells said. A gasoline car’s heating or air conditioning, on the other hand, wouldn’t be able to operate without the engine running and consuming fuel to power the compressor and other parts. A British consumer watchdog group tested an electric vehicle’s battery performance during a simulated traffic jam. Using a Volkswagen ID.4 sport utility vehicle, the testers streamed music, turned on the car’s heated seats to maximum settings, turned on the air conditioner, turned on the headlights and used the car’s USB socket to charge a tablet that was playing a movie. After 75 minutes of using all of those functions while the car was stationary, the car’s main 77 kWh battery lost 2% of its power, equal to 8 miles of driving range. ""In short, a very small amount of the electric car’s battery was used to keep the car comfortable,"" the testers concluded. By comparison, idling the engine in a large car or light truck while in a traffic jam might use half a gallon of gas per hour, Wells said, and much more if it is stop-and-go traffic. A Facebook post says electric vehicles are more prone to a failure in standstill traffic where heating or air conditioning is required. The post misunderstands the way EVs and their batteries work. Electric vehicles use little power when at a standstill, and their climate settings also do not require much power. An electric vehicle with a full battery would have enough energy to operate for a day or longer while stationary during a traffic jam, even while using air conditioning or heating",False,"December 9, 2021"
A chart shows China and India are leading in per capita carbon dioxide emissions.,"Are China and India wildly outpacing the U.S., United Kingdom, Germany and Japan on emissions of carbon dioxide? A chart shared on Facebook shows a staggering increase in carbon dioxide emissions in China and India since 1990, while showing declines for the U.S. and other developed countries over the same time. On Facebook, a user sharing the chart asked: ""Why are we weakening our economy?"" They cited the New York Post as the source. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  This is the image from the Facebook post, which originated from a New York Post opinion article. It’s important to know what the chart shows, and what it doesn’t. It’s important to know what the chart shows, and what it doesn’t. While the headline on the graphic says ""Per capita CO2 emissions,"" what the lines on the chart show is the percentage change in CO2 emissions from 1990 to 2019 for China, India, Japan, the U.S., Germany and the United Kingdom.  It appeared alongside an Oct. 26 opinion article in the New York Post headlined ""Why destroy our economy to cut emissions — when China and India are spewing away?"" The piece ran ahead of the international climate change conference of world leaders in Glasgow, Scotland, called COP26.  The opinion article, written by Eddie Scarry, sourced the data in the chart from Our World in Data, a project of Oxford University. So we asked Hannah Ritchie, a senior researcher for Our World in Data, to tell us more about it.  Ritchie offered a simple explanation: Because China and India had very low levels of per capita emissions in 1990, when their economies were far less developed, their emissions have grown a lot since then. Readers wouldn’t know it from this graphic, but the U.S., U.K., Germany and Japan already had high levels of emissions, which didn’t change very much over the same period. A different way of looking at the data provides more context.  Our World in Data provided a similar chart looking at per capita CO2 emissions for the same countries and time periods. The difference in this chart is that it shows not the percentage change, but rather the actual change in per capita emissions over time, measured in tons. This version of how the data is presented shows the U.S. and Japan leading in per capita CO2 emissions.  The difference in charts from Our World in Data depends on whether the ""relative change"" option was selected. Checking this box shows the percentage change over time and makes it appear as though China and India are leading in CO2 emissions compared with other developed nations.  The Facebook post is missing context because it shows the change in emissions per person, but not the actual emissions.  The United States is responsible for the largest share of historical emissions with about 509 gigatons of carbon dioxide released since 1850. China has the second-largest share of historical emissions with more than 284 gigatons. Simon Evans, deputy editor for Carbon Brief, analyzed why cumulative CO2 emissions matter in an Oct. 5, 2021, article. He wrote:  ""There is a direct, linear relationship between the total amount of CO2 released by human activity and the level of warming at the Earth’s surface. Moreover, the timing of a ton of CO2 being emitted has only a limited impact on the amount of warming it will ultimately cause. ""This means CO2 emissions from hundreds of years ago continue to contribute to the heating of the planet — and current warming is determined by the cumulative total of CO2 emissions over time.""  A Facebook post shows China and India leading in per capita CO2 emissions compared to the U.S., U.K., Germany and Japan between 1990 and 2019.  The chart is missing some context, and the headline is misleading. When looking at the percentage change in per capita CO2 emissions from 1990-2019, China and India have seen the largest increases. Both countries had relatively low emissions in 1990, and they have grown a lot since then. The U.S., U.K., Germany and Japan already had high levels of emissions in 1990, and they have remained at high levels, with the U.S. leading the pack",Half True,"December 2, 2021"
"“Within two years, there were two 500-year (storm) events” in Wisconsin.","In July 2016, northern Wisconsin was battered by severe storms that devastated the area.  The storms led to flash flooding, which overwhelmed small creeks and rivers and washed out roads. Culverts overflowed along rural roads, with the water damage leaving them no longer drivable.  More than 80 boats were damaged or destroyed in Saxon Harbor, where the heavy rainfall caused flooding that almost washed away boat slips and trees, and pipes and cement culverts up from the ground, according to a July 2016 report from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.  Rainfall totals reached 14 inches in some parts of the Northwoods. A broad swath of destruction lingered for years in its path, according to a July 2021 report from the Wausau Daily Herald.  In June 2018, heavy rains pummeled the Northwoods again, dropping 10 or more inches of rain in some areas, according to the National Weather Service.  U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, cited the two storms in a Nov. 6, 2021 panel discussion at the United Nations Climate Change conference, highlighting how unusually  strong the storms have gotten in Wisconsin since she took office.  ""Within two years, there were two 500-year events,"" she said.  But were the storms really that strong?  First, let’s take a look at what a 500-year storm is. It has nothing to do with five centuries of history. A 500-year storm is an event with a 1-in-500 chance of occurring, according to the United States Geological Survey, or an annual probability of occurrence of around .2%.  That is, it’s just a way of defining the statistical probability of a severe storm. For instance, just because there were 11 inches of rain in one day in one year, doesn’t mean that Wisconsin won’t see 11 inches of rain in one day again for another 500 years.  In theory, these types of events with such low statistical probabilities are rare, meaning that it might not make sense for cities, engineers and others to plan around the possibility of them happening -- though that is being rethought, as 500-year storms and floods are happening more often due to climate change, according to an August 2017 report from Vox.  When we asked Baldwin’s team about her claim that the storms were both 500-year events, they sent a host of links from the National Weather Service with data from both events.  According to the data, the 2016 storm did indeed reach the threshold for a 500-year storm in some places, including the community of Saxon Harbor. In other places, the storm reached even higher thresholds.  The storms that pummelled the area in 2018 also reached similar thresholds, with some areas sustaining 500-year rainfalls or higher, according to the NWS.  But the Northwoods aren’t the only area where severe storms have risen to the same 500-year level. Storms in southern parts of the state around the same time also met that definition.  So, Baldwin is a bit off -- though in a way that actually reinforces the point she was making. Daniel Vimont, a professor of atmospheric and oceanic science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said Madison received more than 11 inches of rain on August 21 2018. The threshold for a 500-year rainfall within 24 hours is 9.5 inches.   Then on Aug. 28, 2018, Cashton received over 10 inches of rain within 24 hours, which again rose to the level of a 500-year storm.  Baldwin claimed that since she took office, two ""500-year"" storm events occurred in northern Wisconsin.  Data from the National Weather Service shows that 500-year storms did indeed strike the northernmost counties in Wisconsin in 2016 and 2018, overwhelming creeks and rivers.  But storms in Cashton and Madison in 2018 lso rose to the same level, meaning that there have been more than two such storms within two years in the state.  So Baldwin actually undershot the number of high-impact storms within the state between 2016 and 2018",Mostly True,"November 30, 2021"
Keystone Pipeline was blocked by Obama on Warren Buffett’s behalf.,"On his first day in office, President Joe Biden signed an executive order revoking the permit for the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline, which would have helped carry crude oil from Canada to refineries in the Gulf of Mexico. Months later, a curious social media post suggested the demise of the planned pipeline was the work of former President Barack Obama and was done ​​as a favor to billionaire investor Warren Buffett. The post from Oct. 27 misspells Buffett’s last name and shows an image of a train with the text underneath referencing Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad, which is owned by Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate headed by Buffett. ""In the last 2 election cycles,"" the image reads, ""Buffet gave extensively to Democrat causes and candidates. He also bundled and hosted numerous fundraisers for Obama. If anyone believes the Keystone Pipeline isn’t being blocked by Obama on Buffet’s behalf, I’ve got a bridge to sell you."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  One reason this claim seems a bit out of place? Reverse-image searches show it was being shared as early as 2015, midway through Obama’s second term. At the time, Obama did reject a permit for Keystone XL, arguing in his Nov. 6, 2015, statement that the pipeline would not lower gas prices, increase the nation’s energy security or make a meaningful long-term contribution to the U.S. economy. The Keystone XL pipeline was first proposed more than a decade ago during a period of high oil prices. It would have carried up to 830,000 barrels per day of crude oil from Alberta, Canada, to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with another leg stretching to Gulf Coast refineries.  When President Donald Trump took office, his administration backed the project in the face of objections from environmental groups and attempted to revive the pipeline, but ultimately made little progress.  According to Federal Election Commission records, Buffett did not contribute to Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign. He did, however, donate to the presidential campaigns of both Obama and Hillary Clinton, and in 2019 he donated $248,500 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the official campaign arm of the Democrats in the House of Representatives. Between 2007 and 2012, Buffett gave more than $75,000 to organizations supporting Obama.  Buffett has expressed his support for the Keystone XL Pipeline, even though it would have competed against his Burlington Northern railroad, which transports crude.  Buffett said the pipeline would be good for Canada and America. Buffett assistant Debbie Bosanek told the Associated Press, ""Mr. Buffett has never seen any report by BNSF projecting whether the Keystone Pipeline would increase or decrease the revenue of the railroad."" A Facebook post claims the Keystone Pipeline was blocked by Obama to benefit Buffett. That’s incorrect. The Keystone XL Pipeline has been blocked multiple times for climate, economic, and perceived national-interest reasons. We don’t find evidence that the decision was intended to benefit Buffett.  Buffett, in fact, supported its construction",False,"November 18, 2021"

His presentation focused on lowering carbon dioxide emissions down to zero.  In the clip, Gates introduces a mathematical equation to calculate the amount of global emissions and how to lower it. Part of that equation included the size of the global population.  ""The world today has 6.8 billion people. That's headed up to about 9 billion,"" Gates said. ""Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15%."" The full video is 27 minutes and available on the TEDTalk website. Gates’ comment about the population was a fragment of his speech. He spoke largely about the types of energy and actions that produce CO2, and proposed a solution of energy measures, like nuclear, wind and solar, that would reduce carbon dioxide emissions a great deal by 2050. His point about vaccines has been commonly misconstrued as a plot to depopulate the planet. In 2018, PolitiFact debunked a similar claim. Melinda Gates wrote this in the former couple's annual letter: ""When more children live past age five, and when mothers can decide if and when to have children, population sizes don’t go up. They go down. Parents have fewer children when they’re confident those children will survive into adulthood. Big families are in some ways an insurance policy against the tragic likelihood of losing a son or a daughter."" Bill Gates further outlined the idea in a separate video, showing a chart that illustrated the inclining growth rate of the world’s population and the effect of improving health care.  ""What we found is that as health improves, families choose to have less children, and this effect is very, very dramatic,"" Gates said. ""We find that in every country of the world, this is repeated.""   A website article claimed that Bill Gates advocated for reducing the global population by using vaccines during a 2010 TedTalk. Gates wasn’t talking about reducing the population through vaccination. He and his former wife Melinda have repeatedly said that child mortality is lowered when families have access to life-saving vaccines and health care, allowing families to choose to have fewer children",False,"October 11, 2021"

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) PolitiFact confirmed that there is no new animal methane tax, and there’s no sign it’s even under consideration. Instead, it’s a misinterpretation of an entirely separate policy proposal.  ""There is no ‘cow fart tax,’"" said John Buhl, senior communications manager at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. ""It does not exist."" A pig looks out of its pen at a hog feeding operation near Tribune, Kan. (AP) Meredith Blanford, a spokesperson for Mullin, said the op-ed was referring to legislative language considered by the House Energy and Commerce Committee that would levy a methane tax on oil and gas producers. The provision would tax oil and gas producers $1,500 per metric ton of methane emitted above a threshold. Methane is a contributor to climate change, and environmentalists have sought to curb its release into the atmosphere. Methane is ""the source of one-third of U.S. methane emissions,"" said Frank Mitloehner, a professor and air quality extension specialist in the University of California-Davis animal science department. ""Getting methane right and not using food as a political football is critical to climate science."" When the committee took up the provision, Republicans offered an amendment to exempt livestock from being caught up in enforcement of the methane provision targeted on oil and gas. ""While the language specifies the oil and gas industry, it also references EPA’s greenhouse gas inventory and leaves too much room for the EPA to expand its regulatory reach,"" Blanford said. The amendment failed, with Democrats arguing that it was unnecessary because the provision was explicitly targeted toward fossil fuels, not agriculture. Blanford said the numbers listed in the op-ed came from an analysis by the American Farm Bureau Federation, an agriculture advocacy group. But the group has since clarified that its analysis was theoretical and not descriptive of actual legislation that targeted agricultural emissions. The federation’s communications director, Mike Tomko, told PolitiFact that the data came from an analysis conducted by the group’s economists this past summer, ""to determine the potential impact if agriculture were to be included in legislation imposing a methane fee similar to legislative proposals aimed at oil and gas."" However, Tomko added that ""the current language"" of the bill ""does not impose a methane tax on agriculture."" Two days after the interview, the federation released a public statement reiterating this point, ""to clear up any confusion."" The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association concurred in a statement to USA Today. ""Ultimately, the rumors relative to a potential cow tax are just that — rumors,"" said Danielle Beck, the group’s senior executive director of government affairs. ""And we view it as an unhelpful distraction from the issues at hand."" To further remove any doubt, the Senate on Aug. 10 passed an amendment sponsored by Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, related to ""prohibiting or limiting the issuance of costly Clean Air Act permit requirements on farmers and ranchers in the United States or the imposition of new federal methane requirements on livestock."" The amendment passed, 66-33, with 17 Democrats joining Republicans in voting for it. That was more than two weeks before the Facebook post went public. A Facebook post said, ""Were you aware the $3.5 Trillion Human Infrastructure package includes an animal agriculture tax of $2,600!! per head of cattle? $500 for swine!!!"" Democrats are considering a legislative proposal to tax methane emissions by oil and gas producers as a way of curbing climate change, but the proposal was not written to apply to methane released by livestock operations.

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post implies that since the FDA allows pesticides in food, people shouldn’t trust the agency’s approval of the Pfizer vaccine. But that misrepresents the role of the FDA in regulating pesticides, and ignores the scientific processes that go into vaccine approval decisions. The post uses a misleading claim about pesticide regulation to argue that FDA approval means nothing. That’s not the case. Full approval by the FDA means that the agency has high confidence in the safety, effectiveness and quality of a drug. On Aug. 23, the FDA approved the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for people 16 and older. The vaccine was previously used under emergency use authorization, a designation that still applies for people between 12 and 15. ""While this and other vaccines have met the FDA’s rigorous, scientific standards for emergency use authorization, as the first FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine, the public can be very confident that this vaccine meets the high standards for safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality the FDA requires of an approved product,"" acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said in a press release. Although the COVID-19 vaccines were already deemed safe and effective with the emergency use authorization, full approval means that businesses and schools may have more leeway to require the Pfizer vaccine, and the shot can stay on the market beyond the health emergency. The FDA says the approval process includes an analysis of the condition and available treatments, assessment of benefits and risks through manufacturer-provided data, and strategies for managing risks associated with the drug. The road to FDA approval starts with a vaccine undergoing three different phases of clinical trials, according to University of Chicago Medicine. Each phase of the trial increases the number of participants and the scope of what researchers look for. Vaccine manufacturers then have to submit a Biologics License Application to the FDA, which includes data from clinical and non-clinical trials, technical information, labeling information, and more. In Pfizer’s case, this application built upon the extensive data submitted to support its emergency use authorization. Pfizer submitted its application for full FDA approval in May 2021, and it was the fastest FDA approval of a vaccine ever. ""The public and medical community can be confident that although we approved this vaccine expeditiously, it was fully in keeping with our existing high standards for vaccines in the U.S.,"" said Peter Marks, the director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. Regulation of pesticides in the food supply is shared between the Environmental Protection Agency and the FDA. The regulations concern the safety of the pesticides used in growing food, and how much pesticide residue can remain on food without causing harm. This residue is often measured in parts per million. Simply put, the EPA sets the allowable limits on pesticide residue that would be safe for human consumption, and the FDA is responsible for enforcing these limits. The limits apply to food that’s imported or grown in the U.S. In setting the limits, the EPA examines factors such as the pesticide’s toxicity, how much growers apply and how it breaks down. One way the FDA enforces these limits is through its Pesticide Residue Monitoring Program, which tests a variety of food samples every year to see whether they meet federal guidelines for over 800 pesticides and chemicals. ""Very small amounts of pesticides that may remain in or on fruits, vegetables, grains, and other foods decrease considerably as crops are harvested, transported, exposed to light, washed, prepared and cooked,"" EPA spokesperson Tim Carroll said. ""The EPA agrees with experts who recommend consuming a varied diet that includes many fruits and vegetables, and washing them first with plain water to remove dirt, bacteria and pesticide residues."" Under law, the EPA is also required to reevaluate the safety of existing pesticides, although that doesn’t mean the agency isn’t subject to political and industry pressures. In 2017, then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt rejected the agency’s recommendation to ban using chlorpyrifos on food, a pesticide linked to neurological damage in children. This year, the EPA reversed the decision and announced that it would ban the pesticide, but it will take time to phase out its use on food completely. A Facebook post claimed that ""FDA approval means nothing when you realize the FDA also approves pesticides in our food!"" The FDA does not approve pesticides in food. The EPA sets limits for safe levels of pesticide residue on food, and the FDA monitors the food supply to enforce the limits. The FDA’s approval process for vaccines begins with three phases of clinical trials to establish their safety and efficacy, and a review of data from clinical and non-clinical trials along with other supporting documentation",Mostly False,"August 27, 2021"
"“A farm with 2,500 dairy cattle is similar in waste load to a city of 411,000 people.”","It’s no secret that factory farms produce a lot of waste.  Also known as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, or CAFOs, the farms are home to thousands of animals at a time, ranging from cows to hogs to chickens. One of the most common complaints about the large-scale farms is the waste, which must be collected and disposed of in some way.  It’s no surprise that a case involving the waste from factory farms made its way to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, though the written decision in the case raised an interesting question: Exactly how much waste does a CAFO produce?  The court held that the state Department of Natural Resources has the ability to impose a maximum number of animals on factory farms and off-site groundwater monitoring conditions on factory farms. In writing the majority decision, Justice Jill Karofsky cited an evaluation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which stated that ""a farm with 2,500 dairy cattle is similar in waste load to a city of 411,000 people.""  But in America’s Dairyland, we know our cows. And that number seems awfully high.  Is it true that a dairy farm of 2,500 cows could really produce more waste than the population Madison, Racine and Oshkosh combined?  Let’s check it out.  If you look at the study referenced by Karofsky, ""Risk Assessment Evaluation for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations,"" it does indeed state that a farm of 2,500 animals produces as much waste as a city of 411,000.  But, the paper was published in 2004, making it 17 years old.  So we went in search of newer information.  A Dec. 6, 2019 report by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel likened a herd of 1,000 cows to the city of Fond du Lac, which has 42,000 residents. So, by that measure, 2,500 cows would equal a city of about 105,000 --  much smaller than Karofsky wrote. The article also noted the largest CAFO in the state, which boasts 6,000 cows, generates about as much manure and urine as 252,000 people, roughly the size of the city of Madison. So, at 2,500 cows, the comparison point would again be a city of about 105,000. And studies by Cornell University animal science department professors Michael Van Amburgh and Karl Czymmek, published in 2017, showed that a herd of about 340 cows can produce the same amount of waste as 10,736 humans.  That puts the amount of waste for a herd of 2,500 cows at about the same level as 79,000 humans, a smaller number, but one even further under the number cited in the state high court’s opinion. In writing a recent decision for the state Supreme Court, Karofsky claimed a herd of 2,500 cows produces as much waste as a city of 411,000 people. The statistic was part of a case that upheld the state DNR’s ability to consider the number of animals at factory farms and whether groundwater should be monitored offsite.  That’s an awful lot of waste from a lot of cows. And a 17-year-old study included the figure. But newer numbers suggest that while cows produce a lot of waste -- up to 17 gallons of it a day, per animal -- a farm of 2,500 cows isn’t producing the same amount of waste as 411,000 people. It’s more like 100,000 people. We’re going to have to call bull on this claim",False,"July 20, 2021"

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Instagram is owned by Facebook. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The charging station shown in the post is located at an outlet mall in Round Rock, an Austin suburb. However, the description of how it operates is wrong. Electrify America, which operates the charging station, called the claim that it uses electricity derived from a diesel generator ""absolutely false."" ""Our direct-current fast electric-vehicle charging station in Round Rock, Texas, is powered by Oncor Electric Delivery Company, one of the largest utility companies in the U.S.,"" Mike Moran, a spokesperson for the company, said in an email. Oncor distributes electricity across the Texas electric grid but doesn’t generate its own power. An Oncor spokesperson said it’s hard to pinpoint exactly what kind of energy is used to power the Round Rock station — whether it’s derived from coal, nuclear, wind or solar energy. Similar claims linking electric vehicles to diesel generators have circulated before. A July 1 post used much of the same text, but with a different image and without any mention of Texas. It claimed diesel charging stations are ""popping up everywhere."" The picture used in that post is actually of a diesel-powered charging station, but not anything like the public ones that are being installed around the country. This one was created as an experiment in 2018 in Australia to test the viability of using a diesel generator to charge a car in the desert. Jon Edwards, the man who thought of the experiment, told The Driven he wanted to see whether charging with a diesel generator was viable, and how the fuel consumption for the generator compared with driving a similar-size diesel-powered car. The experiment involved using the charger to charge 10 electric cars — most of them Teslas — for one hour each, and measuring how much energy was added to the battery during charging. Edwards used the lifetime averages for each car to convert that energy figure to an estimate of the added distance the car could travel after charging. The experiment found that when charged this way, a BMW i3 was the most fuel-efficient of the electric cars, consuming 4.39 liters of fuel for every 100 kilometers of range added, equivalent to about 54 mpg. One Tesla model consumed around 7 liters of diesel fuel per 100 km of range, equivalent to about 34 mpg.  Edwards’ experiment found that, in most instances, using the generator to charge a car consumed less fuel than a similarly sized diesel car would to travel the same distance. A diesel-fueled VW Touareg SUV, for example, used 7.2 liters of fuel per 100 km. A Facebook post claims an electric car charging station in Texas runs on a diesel generator and that a car has to charge for three hours and use 12 gallons of diesel fuel to travel 200 miles.  The company that owns the charging station pictured in the post says the station is connected to an electrical grid and does not use diesel fuel. Public chargers are generally connected to the local power supply and do not use diesel generators",False,"July 19, 2021"
“Prairie State power plant is the cleanest coal-fired power plant in the nation.”,"As Republican operatives were dropping U.S. Rep. Rodney Davis's name as the next potential rival to run against Gov. J.B. Pritzker, the GOP congressman was in southern Illinois visiting a coal plant that could get shut down if the governor gets his way. Davis used the visit to criticize the governor’s support for a sweeping energy plan that could shutter every coal-fired power plant in Illinois by 2035, an idea many opponents lambast as one that will kill jobs and hike rates. Davis called on Pritzker, a Democrat, to spare the Prairie State Energy Campus in Marissa, located south of East St. Louis. The plant provides power to municipalities in eight states, including a swath of Davis’ 13th Congressional District. ""The municipally owned Prairie State power plant is the cleanest coal-fired power plant in the nation,"" he said during his June 18 visit. ""The company is actively pursuing and adopting additional carbon sequestration and storage and emissions-reducing technologies, and they should receive support from state and federal agencies for their efforts."" One of Prairie State Energy Campus’ two power units was selected in 2019 as the site of a U.S. Department of Energy-backed carbon capture research project slated for completion at the end of 2021. But federal data show the plant has been one of the nation’s 10 biggest emitters of heat-trapping carbon dioxide, a fact recently highlighted by the Chicago Sun-Times and Chicago Tribune. While experts say there are multiple ways to evaluate which coal plants are the ""cleanest"" beyond total CO2 emissions — which tend to single out the power plants producing the most electricity — Prairie State ranked nowhere near the top based on any of the yardsticks we found to measure it. Davis’ office did not respond to calls or emails requesting comment. Defining how ""clean"" a coal plant is depends on whom you ask — and when, according to experts. ""‘Clean coal’ has been this sort of amorphous term that has meant whatever people want it to mean, and it's changed over time,"" said Daniel Cohan, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Rice University. Before climate change gained significant attention, Cohan and other experts said, coal plants were generally judged by their emission of regulated air pollutants causing smog and acid rain such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Amid growing concern over climate change, however, experts said there’s a case for including CO2 emissions in the conversation about which plants are the ""cleanest."" To compare Prairie State’s emissions against other power plants, Cohan pointed us to data published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency showing how much of a given gas or pollutant power plants emit per unit of electricity they generate. In 2019, the latest year for which this data was available, Prairie State Generating Station ranked 169th of 306 coal plants in the nation with EPA data for CO2 emission rates. Its ranking for its SO2 emission rate was roughly the same. Prairie State performed better when it came to its NOx emission rate — placing 37th — but still nowhere near the top. ""By no means is this a clean power plant,"" Cohan said, referencing the EPA data. ""It’s still a substantial contributor to air pollution and climate change."" Calling Prairie State the cleanest coal plant in the country, he added, ""would be absurd."" Emily Grubert, an energy systems researcher and professor at Georgia Tech, agreed. ""It’s not the cleanest by any reasonable metric,"" she said. Davis said the Prairie State power plant is ""the cleanest"" coal-fired power plant in the nation. His office did not respond to our inquiry asking for evidence to back that up. Experts told us there are multiple metrics by which to assess how ""clean"" a coal plant is, but federal data shows Prairie State does not come out at or near the top on any of them",False Pants on Fire,"June 27, 2021"
The Biden administration “ignores the negative environmental impact created by lithium mining.”,"If President Joe Biden is going to achieve his vision of putting millions more electric cars and trucks on America’s highways, lithium ion batteries will be a key piece of the effort. So far, these relatively lightweight energy cells are the best bet for going electric and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In a recent op-ed that skewered Biden’s budget plan as bloated and wasteful, Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley highlighted one of the challenges to getting enough lithium to make that shift to electric vehicles happen.  ""The president’s budget showers hundreds of billions of dollars into federal incentives for U.S. consumers to jump on the EV bandwagon, electrify school buses and install EV chargers across the country,"" Grassley wrote June 7.  But, Grassley continued, the Biden administration ""ignores the negative environmental impact created by lithium mining needed for EV batteries and power storage."" Biden and his Democratic Party offer themselves as environmental defenders. It would be a big deal if they sacrificed local environmental safety in the quest to meet national or global climate change goals. Most lithium mining comes with an environmental cost, and a major new Nevada project has drawn lawsuits from environmental groups. But Grassley’s claim goes too far in saying the administration is ignoring the problems lithium extraction poses in its push for electric vehicles. His staff explained that he was speaking only about Biden’s budget plan, not the administration’s policy across the board. That falls wide of the mark, too. Lithium-ion batteries are used for most plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and all-electric vehicles. Smaller versions also power our cell phones and laptops. Today, most lithium comes from Australia or South America. With demand projected to skyrocket, the U.S. has put a premium on producing more lithium at home. The Thacker Pass mine in northern Nevada has become the country’s first large expansion of lithium production in a decade.  Grassley’s staff pointed us to news stories about the Thacker Pass mine, a 1,000 acre open-pit mine, expected to produce 60,000 metric tons per year of battery-grade lithium carbonate. The Bureau of Land Management gave final approval to the mine on Jan. 15, 2021, in the final week of the Trump administration. The move drew a quick reaction from those who saw the mine as a threat. A local rancher sued to reverse the permit, as did several land conservation groups.  They argued that the owner, Lithium Americas, downplayed the millions of gallons of water it would use, and the pressure that would place on limited water supplies. They noted that the government’s own assessment showed that operations would raise the level of antimony, a toxic metal, in the groundwater, high enough to exceed state minimums. There would also be habitat loss. We asked the Bureau of Land Management if it was taking another look at the permit, and the agency said it had no comment. The government has assigned a Justice Department lawyer to defend against the lawsuits. It’s fair to say that, as Grassley complained, the Biden administration is now overseeing a project that could hurt the environment. But the administration’s policy goes beyond that one mine. The Bureau of Land Management is currently vetting another lithium mining project in Nevada, more to the south along the border with California. The Clayton Valley lithium pilot plant has an initial environmental assessment that considers the potential impacts on water, air, habitat and cultural resources. The government has not yet signed off on the permit. Based solely on where the process sits today, the administration is not ignoring the negative effects of lithium mining. The administration has also shown interest in finding alternatives to traditional mining techniques to extract lithium. One small Energy Department project offers $4 million to develop ways to get lithium out of the briny waters of geothermal aquifers.  On a larger scale, the department’s budget request asks Congress for $75 million to build a lithium battery recycling system. In its blueprint for lithium batteries, the department said the goal is to ""enhance environmental sustainability, and support a U.S.-based circular materials supply chain."" Grassley said that the Biden administration ""ignores the negative environmental impact created by lithium mining.""  There’s not much to back that up. The administration now oversees a project approved by the Trump administration that has drawn lawsuits, but it is vetting another lithium mine proposal against a full menu of environmental considerations. If Grassley was speaking solely about Biden’s budget plan, the facts support him even less. The Energy Department is seeking $75 million to recycle lithium batteries as a strategy to increase supply with less environmental damage.  People might argue that the administration isn’t doing enough, but there’s no evidence that the administration is ignoring the downsides of lithium mining",False,"June 9, 2021"
Says a photo shows a “lithium mine for hybrid cars.”,"A self-proclaimed ""public service announcement"" widely shared on Facebook tries to portray the manufacturing of hybrid vehicles as bad for the environment — but the key photo it uses is of a gold mine. One photo appears to show a pipeline cutting a clean and narrow path through a forest; the other shows an expansive pit that looks like it’s been stripped by a machine.  ""Keystone Pipeline vs. Lithium Mine for Hybrid Cars. But it’s all about the environment right?"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We traced the top photo to a Flickr page that identifies the image as a section of the Alaska Pipeline. The Trump administration approved construction of an 875-mile extension of the Keystone line — Keystone XL — but President Joe Biden reversed the approval in January with an executive order, on the grounds that it is harmful to the environment. The bottom photo does not show a mine to extract lithium, an element used to make batteries. It’s a gold mine. A Google search and a TinEye reverse-image search shows the image is  widely available as a Getty Images stock photo, depicting a gold mine in Kalgoorlie, Australia. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen attempts on Facebook to compare the environmental effects of a pipeline against hybrid or electric vehicles. In March, we rated a similar post False because the ""lithium mine"" it alleged to be showing was actually a copper and cobalt mine. Lithium-ion batteries are used for most plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and all-electric vehicles, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Most of their components can be recycled, ""but the cost of material recovery remains a challenge for the industry,"" the department says. The world’s lithium is either mined in Australia or from salt flats in the Andean regions of Argentina, Bolivia and Chile. The operations use large amounts of groundwater. The water required means that manufacturing electric vehicles is about 50% more water intensive than traditional internal combustion engines, the New York Times reported. Most lithium is extracted from salty liquid brines that are far beneath the Earth’s surface, according to the Minerals Education Coalition — not open-pit mines like the copper one shown in the photos. That’s not to say lithium isn’t ever extracted from open-pit mines, it’s just less common and often involves smaller pits",False,"May 26, 2021"
"""Manufacturing the battery for one electric car produces the same amount of carbon dioxide as running a petrol car for eight years.""","Electric vehicles are touted as an environmentally friendly alternative to gasoline powered cars, but one Facebook post claims that the benefits are overblown, and the vehicles are much more harmful to the planet than people assume. A cartoon posted to Facebook on April 29, shows a car in one panel with ""diesel"" written on the side and the driver thinking ""I feel so dirty."" In another panel, a car has ""electric"" written on its side with the driver thinking ""I feel so clean."" However, the electric vehicle is shown connected to what appears to be a factory that’s blowing dark smoke into the air. Below the cartoon is a caption that claims ""manufacturing the battery for one electric car produces the same amount of CO2 as running a petrol car for eight years."" This isn’t a new line of criticism against electric vehicles. Similar Facebook posts have taken aim at the carbon dioxide produced in the manufacturing of electric cars — specifically the batteries — to make the case that zero emissions vehicles aren’t necessarily clean. Full electric vehicles require a large lithium-ion battery to store energy and power the motor that propels the car, according to Insider. The lithium-ion battery packs in an electric car are chemically similar to the ones found in cell phones and laptops. Because they require a mix of metals that need to be extracted and refined, lithium-ion batteries take more energy to produce than the common lead-acid batteries used in gasoline cars to help start the engine. How much CO2 is emitted in the production depends on where the lithium-ion battery is made — or specifically, how the electricity powering the factory is generated — according to Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist and director of climate and energy at the Breakthrough Institute, an environmental research think tank. Producing a 75 kilowatt-hour battery for a Tesla Model 3, considered on the larger end of batteries for electric vehicles, would result in the emission of 4,500 kilograms of CO2 if it was made at Tesla's battery factory in Nevada. That’s the emissions equivalent to driving a gas-powered sedan for 1.4 years, at a yearly average distance of 12,000 miles, Hausfather said. If the battery were made in Asia, manufacturing it would produce 7,500 kg of carbon dioxide, or the equivalent of driving a gasoline-powered sedan for 2.4 years — but still nowhere near the eight years claimed in the Facebook post. Hausfather said the larger emission amount in Asia can be attributed to its ""higher carbon electricity mix."" The continent relies more on coal for energy production, while Tesla’s Nevada factory uses some solar energy.  ""More than half the emissions associated with manufacturing the battery are associated with electricity use,"" Hausfather said in an email to PolitiFact. ""So, as the electricity grid decarbonizes, emissions associated with battery production will decline. The same is not true for sedan tailpipe emissions."" The Facebook post does not mention the electricity needs and CO2 impact of factories that build gasoline or diesel cars and their components.  Another thing the Facebook post omits is that the CO2 emitted in the production of the battery can be offset over a short time in an electric car by the lack of tailpipe emissions when it’s in operation.  The Union of Concerned Scientists found in a 2015 report that taking into account electricity sources for charging, an electric vehicle ends up reducing greenhouse gas emissions by about 50% compared with a similar size gas-powered car. A midsize vehicle completely negates the carbon dioxide its production emits by the time it travels 4,900 miles, according to the report. For full size cars, it takes 19,000 miles of driving. The U.S. Energy Department’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy also looked at the life cycle of electric vehicles — which includes a car’s production, use and disposal — and concluded they produce less greenhouse gases and smog than gasoline-powered vehicles. The agency also found drivers could further lower CO2 emissions by charging with power generated by a renewable energy source.  A cartoon shared on Facebook claims the carbon dioxide emitted from the production of one electric car battery is the equivalent to driving a gas-powered vehicle for eight years. The production of lithium-ion batteries for electric cars emits a significant amount of carbon dioxide, but nowhere near the level claimed in the cartoon. The emissions from battery production are equivalent to driving a gasoline car for one or two years, depending on where it’s produced, and those emissions are effectively offset over time by the lack of tailpipe emissions when the car is on the road",Mostly False,"May 11, 2021"
"With the goal to preserve 30% of the earth’s land and water by 2030, “300 million people stand to lose their land and livelihood, most of them tribal and indigenous peoples.”","As part of his plan to put the brakes on climate change, President Joe Biden set a goal of conserving 30% of America’s land and waters by 2030. For land in particular, that’s a heavy lift — only about 12% of the nation’s land is now under some form of protection. Biden’s target is part of a larger international ambition to protect a third of the world’s land and waters by 2030. On a global scale, the protected regions would do a lot of work to pull carbon from the air and store it in the soil, coral reefs, sea grasses and other carbon sinks. The effort goes under name 30 by 30, or 30x30. But some advocates for indigenous peoples see a threat in the international push to protect land. One of those groups, Survival International, calls the global 30x30 plan ""the biggest land grab in history."" Survival International sees the 30x30 initiative as driving people off the land their communities may have occupied for hundreds of years, without giving them a fair voice in the process. ""Three hundred million people stand to lose their land and livelihood, most of them tribal and indigenous peoples,"" the group said in a message posted to its website on Earth Day, April 22. The 300 million figure, almost as much as the population of the U.S., is a very large number. We dug in to see where that figure comes from, and whether it represents a reasonable estimate of the likely harm due to the 30x30 plan. Backers of the 30x30 initiative question Survival International’s reasoning. They say that the plan is designed to strengthen the rights of indigenous people to stay on their land and maintain a traditional way of life — that conservation doesn’t necessarily mean eviction. Independent experts, meanwhile, see the 300 million figure as a reasonable estimate of how many people live in or near areas that are prime for conservation. But they don’t agree that the number accurately reflects how many could lose their land in the context of 30x30. A group of 51 countries, led by Costa Rica, France and the United Kingdom, are pressing to see the 30x30 goal adopted at a major international gathering on biodiversity taking place in China in October. The group includes nations from Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania and the Americas. Protecting indigenous peoples ranks at the top of their priorities. ""Indigenous peoples and local communities are protectors of the most biodiverse sites in the world,"" the group wrote when they launched Jan. 11, 2021. ""To effectively and equitably meet this increased target, they should be engaged as partners in the design and management of these conserved areas."" Brian O’Donnell, director of Colorado-based Campaign for Nature, backs the 30x30 effort. He objects to the characterization by Survival International. ""They have redefined our policies and our intent,"" O’Donnell said. ""Our aim is to safeguard and secure more rights for indigenous people. Getting land tenure rights for indigenous people is the pathway to reach 30x30."" O’Donnell said there is no dispute that conservation efforts have displaced people and led to human rights abuses in the past. He also said the current draft of the biodiversity framework slated for a vote in October should change.  ""It’s a work in progress,"" he said. ""There are some safeguards in there now for indigenous people, but they need to be stronger."" Staff at Survival International said they derived their estimate of 300 million from a 2019 study that looked at a more ambitious goal of protecting half of the world’s land and waters from development.  A team led by a University of Cambridge researcher estimated that at that 50% level, at least 1 billion people live in areas that would fall under some form of protection. Survival International staff said that in a follow-up email to a partner group — the Rainforest Foundation UK — the Cambridge researcher said preservation of 30% of land and water would affect about 297 million people. Survival International added its own take on the study. Where the researchers warned of potential problems with that level of protection, Survival International expressed it more definitively: that the 30x30 plan ""will increase human suffering and the destruction of nature. It is a deadly distraction from what is urgently needed to secure human diversity and all biodiversity: the recognition of indigenous peoples’ rights to their land."" One clarification: Survival International said in its article that ""most"" of the 300 million people potentially affected would be indigenous or tribal people. But when pressed, the group's staff said it’s not clear that it would be a majority. They told us they should have said ""many."" There are countless examples in history of indigenous people being forced off their land in the name  of conservation. In Botswana, the government banned the San people  of the Kalahari desert from their traditional lands to boost tourism and mining. In Thailand, two national park officials were charged with the murder of an indigenous human rights defender in 2019. The government later sought to have the forest that the activist had fought over designated as a UNESCO world heritage site. In the U.S., Montana’s Glacier National Park was carved out of land used by the Blackfeet Nation. Initially, tribe members had negotiated to hold on to hunting and fishing rights. But when the park was created in 1910, they lost everything. The abuses continue today, and there’s no guarantee that they won’t happen under the 30x30 initiative. But protecting land doesn’t have to entail displacing people. It is a risk, not a certainty. And the extent of that risk depends on how the land is protected. Globally, policies in the category of conservation vary, from cutting off all human activity, to allowing traditional practices, to allowing other sustainable uses. Each nation can craft its own rules for each situation. In the U.S., the interplay of legislation, an open public process and executive decisions have produced places where many uses are allowed, and others where there are no roads and no permanent residences. Researcher Stephen Garnett at Charles Darwin University in Australia cautioned that Survival International’s 300 million estimate, when applied to 30x30, is shaky for two reasons. First, we can’t know for sure which lands would be conserved under the plan. Second, the 30x30 strategy doesn’t hinge on setting land aside in a way that would ban farming or other land uses. Garnett says Australia has approached this by designating ""Indigenous Protected Areas"" to make sure aboriginal residents can continue to live on and use the land as they always have. They make up nearly half of Australia’s conserved areas, he said. A quick look at Survival International’s own website shows the pitfalls of treating all types of conservation projects as a threat to indigenous people. One news brief focuses on a tribe in India protesting their eviction from traditional honey-gathering sites inside the Nagarhole National Park. With backing from the Wildlife Conservation Society, the land is now a refuge for tigers, and a source of tourism dollars. But another bulletin tells the story of an indigenous group in Peru that wants an international human rights commission to enforce protections for land that was supposed to be kept as a tribal reserve. The Peruvian government, the post said, had reactivated logging, oil and gas concessions in these areas. Both are examples of conservation efforts. But in the first case, conservation leads to the eviction of people. In the second, conservation is a tool to protect traditional uses of the land. Survival International campaign director Fiore Longo acknowledged in an email to PolitiFact that the terms can get confusing, and ""we have to see what a protected area means and which model is applied where."" But in the dire prediction on its website that 30x30 would put 300 million people at risk, Survival International doesn’t spell out those nuances. ""The main assumption to yield a number like that is that anyone in a future protected area would get kicked out,"" said University of Maryland ecology professor Erle Ellis. ""This is not the intention of anyone working on 30x30."" Survival International said under the 30x30 plan, ""300 million people stand to lose their land and livelihood, most of them tribal and indigenous peoples."" The 300 million figure is derived from a study on the impact of land conservation efforts, but not the 30x30 initiative specifically. While conservation efforts have led to forced evictions in the past, that’s not always the case, and the assumption that 30x30 would do so runs counter to the stated priorities of the nations pressing for the plan.  Survival International said it should have said ""many"" not ""most"" of the 300 million would be indigenous people. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression",Mostly False,"May 7, 2021"
"The Green New Deal “costs an average American household almost $700,000 through 2029.”","U.S. Rep. Ben Cline recently put an eye-popping taxpayer price tag on the Green New Deal - a bold but vague climate change-centered plan that has been roundly condemned by Republicans. ""It crushes jobs, costs an average American household almost $700,000 through 2029,"" Cline, R-Va., said of the proposal during a brief floor speech on April 22.  Think about it. The average annual household income in 2019, the latest year available, was $68,700. The average household cost of the Green New Deal, according to Cline’s statement, would be about $75,000 a year. Cline is essentially saying every penny of earnings by an average household will be swallowed by the plan. Cline, who represents Virginia’s 6th Congressional District, running from Roanoke through the Shenandoah Valley, is hardly the first Republican to make this $700,000 statement. It’s been a talking point for two years. Fortunately for taxpayers, the claim doesn’t hold up. Here’s why: Green New Deal Basics The Green New Deal is a resolution - that is, a non-binding proposal and not actual legislation. It has been introduced in the House by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. and is cosponsored by 101 Democrats. There’s a companion resolution in the Senate introduced by Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., and cosponsored by 12 Democrats. The measures have been referred to subcommittees. Ocasio-Cortez and Markey introduced almost identical Green New Deal resolutions in 2019 that met heavy Republican opposition. One was killed in the Senate and the other never came up for a vote in the House. Broadly speaking, the resolutions address ways to curb climate change and protect the environment. Their far-reaching goals include ""eliminating pollution and greenhouse gas emissions as much as technologically feasible"" and ""meeting 100% of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources.""  The Green New Deal reaches into other policy areas, as well. It calls for creation of ""millions of high-wage union jobs,"" investment in infrastructure, and ""promoting social justice and equality."" But the proposals have never laid out cost figures. And they have not received a cost estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office — the gold-standard source on pricing proposed federal programs. Source of the $700,000 figure Cline’s office told us the congressman’s $700,000 tax figure comes from a 2019 report on the Green New Deal by the American Action Forum, which describes itself as a ""center-right"" think tank. The forum is a sister organization of the American Action Network, a conservative, nonprofit advocacy organization. The report doesn’t mention the $700,000 figure or a total for the estimated per-household cost. However, it does show estimated household costs for different parts of the Green New Deal from 2020-2029. Most of the cost estimates were expressed in ranges. Cline said the Green New Deal  ""costs an average American household almost $700,000 through 2029,"" - which suggests a massive tax increase for every family. But the American Action Forum analysis doesn’t actually say that typical households will pay that cost in new taxes.  If we add up the high-end range estimate in each category, it comes to $671,010 between 2020 and 2029. If we add up the low-end figure in each category, it comes to $369,010. To come up with estimates, the American Action Forum made a series of assumptions, such as that the Green New Deal would invest so heavily in high-speed rail transit ""that air travel becomes unnecessary."" The actual text of the resolution does not call for grounding airplanes.  The American Action Forum analysis also assumed the plan would include a Medicare for All proposal similar to one made by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and estimated it would cost average households $260,000 over 10 years. However, the texts of the green resolutions don’t mention Medicare for All -- instead, they more broadly call for ""hig h quality health care"" for everyone. The American Action Forum put a number of caveats in its study that Cline and many other Republicans omit. It said, ""The breadth of its proposals makes it daunting to assess the (Green New Deal) using the standard tools of policy analysis"" and called its study an ""initial foray."" The researchers wrote that many of the goals in the plan would require policies that are ""redundant with other aspects in it, which also complicates a precise analysis, as the interactions are difficult to predict."" The report’s lead author is Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of American Action Forum and former director of the Congressional Budget Office. He has told PolitiFact he would need more details about the Green New Deal to conduct a more specific cost analysis. Our ruling Cline said the Green New Deal ""costs an average American household almost $700,000 through 2029."" The Green New Deal is a set of goals, not detailed policies attached to specific taxes. The $700,000 number comes from a brief that its author, the right-of-center American Action Forum, acknowledges is a preliminary and rough estimate. The analysis did not say an average household would pay an extra $700,000 in taxes. Instead, it estimated a range of possible costs under different scenarios over 10 years and Cline took the highest number.  It’s possible the resolution will eventually lead to specific legislation that can be formally analyzed for potential costs, but at this point, the proposals are murky",False,"May 5, 2021"
"""Biden's climate requirements"" will ""cut 90% of red meat from diet"" to a ""max 4 lbs per year"" and ""one burger per month.""","One day after President Joe Biden pledged to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in half, Fox News and Fox Business Network personalities repeatedly and baselessly claimed that the move would also force Americans to say goodbye to hamburgers and steaks. ""To meet the Biden Green New Deal targets, America has to, get this, America has to stop eating meat,"" said Fox Business Network host Larry Kudlow, a former economic adviser to President Donald Trump, on April 23. ""No burger on July 4. No steaks on the barbecue."" Biden’s climate plans do not include restrictions on red meat consumption, a White House official confirmed to PolitiFact. Biden never mentioned red meat when he announced his plan to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 52% below 2005 levels by 2030, a move that would double the U.S.’s commitment under the 2015 Paris climate agreement. But across several Fox News and Fox Business Network programs, the story told was different. Hosts such as Kudlow and Fox News’s Jesse Watters wrongly claimed that Americans would have to take steaks off their grills in order for the U.S. to hit Biden’s target, while the networks’ chyrons and graphics gave the same false claims a visual flair. One Fox News graphic, for example, said ""Biden’s climate requirements"" would ""cut 90% of red meat from diet"" by holding Americans to ""max 4 lbs per year"" and ""one burger per month.""  A screenshot of an inaccurate Fox News graphic about Joe Biden's climate plans. The graphic aired April 23 on ""America Reports."" The false claims about Biden restricting access to meat originated with a Daily Mail article that linked Biden’s goals to an unrelated January 2020 study on meat consumption. The article speculated that ""Americans may have to cut their red meat consumption by a whopping 90%,"" citing a University of Michigan study that had no link to Biden’s plan. ""The study was published in January 2020, when Trump was still president, so it had nothing to do with Biden or his climate change plan,"" said Tulane University professor Diego Rose, one of the study’s three co-authors. ""It's all just sensational goo from ‘Fox & Friends.’"" ""The study shows that if we eat less meat, especially beef, we could substantially reduce our dietary carbon footprint. But that change in behavior is a choice that individuals will make."" In a separate statement, co-authors Martin Heller and Gregory Keoleian of the University of Michigan explained that one hypothetical scenario the study considered was a 90% reduction in beef combined with a 50% reduction in other meats. They found that such a change would reduce ""diet-related greenhouse gas emissions associated with agricultural production"" by 50%. ""But this is not a specific recommended policy for achieving a 50% reduction in U.S. carbon emissions,"" Heller and Keoleian said. The false claims about Biden’s climate policies cropped up on social media after the Daily Mail story went live, but they got an assist from Fox News and Fox Business Network, with the first claims on those networks coming during the ""Fox & Friends"" morning talk show. ""Here’s an example of how it’s going to affect your lifestyle,"" host Brian Kilmeade said April 23. ""It’s going to cut 90% of red meat out of a diet. That’s four pounds a year."" ""Part of his climate or green targets are to cut our red meat,"" host Ainsley Earhardt repeated minutes later. ""He wants to cut out 90% of the red meat that you all eat."" Other Fox journalists followed suit, including Kudlow, Charles Payne and Jesse Watters. Watters said on ""The Five"" that to make Biden’s climate plan happen, ""Americans would have to cut red meat consumption by a whopping 90%. That means only one burger a month."" He repeated the same claim the following night on ""Watters’ World."" In the primetime hour, Fox News host Sean Hannity said April 23 that Biden’s plans ""will impact how you eat, including red meat."" On April 24, Jeanine Pirro asked, ""Do you like red meat? … Not so fast. The left with their Green New Deal wants to make sure you don’t."" The false claims were not limited to the talk show hosts, however. Fox News White House correspondent John Roberts opened his April 23 news segment on ""America Reports,"" a daytime news program, by telling viewers, ""Say goodbye to your burgers if you want to sign up for the climate agenda. That’s the finding of one study."" Later that night, anchor Shannon Bream asked her viewers, ""Could new climate impact plans limit you to just one burger a month?""  Correspondent Kevin Corke told Bream that under Biden’s plan, ""all Americans would have to limit their consumption of burgers by about one a month.""  Screenshots of Fox News and Fox Business Network graphics and chyrons about Joe Biden's climate plans. After fact-checkers and news outlets pointed out that the claims about Biden limiting meat were inaccurate, Roberts walked back the claims. ""That research from 2020 found that cutting back how much red meat people eat would have a drastic impact on harmful greenhouse gas emissions,"" Roberts said of the study. ""The data was accurate, but a graphic and the script incorrectly implied that it was part of Biden’s plan for dealing with climate change. That is not the case."" But the false narrative about Biden banning burgers had already taken hold. On social media, Republicans used the claims to attack Biden. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., branded him as the ""Hamburglar,"" while Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., told him to ""stay out of my kitchen."" ""Joe Biden’s climate plan includes cutting 90% of red meat from our diets by 2030,"" Boebert said, falsely, in her tweet. The since-corrected Fox News graphic was also shared widely, including in tweets by Donald Trump Jr. and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas. On Facebook, posts sharing it got tens of thousands of engagements and were flagged as part of the platform’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  In a graphic, Fox News claimed that ""Biden's climate requirements"" will ""cut 90% of red meat from diet"" to a ""max 4 lbs per year"" and ""one burger per month."" The graphic echoed other chyrons and statements made by the network’s personalities the day after Biden pledged to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030. But the graphic is wrong, and Roberts issued a correction days later. Biden’s climate plans do not include restrictions on red meat consumption, a White House official confirmed.

Two photos show climate change “is a hoax.”,"A few days before Earth Day 2021, a meme spread across Facebook claiming to have proof that climate change is a hoax. But a couple of water’s-edge photographs don’t prove anything, climatewise. The meme’s sarcastic headline was: ""99 years of sea level rise — Palm Beach Sydney."" Palm Beach is a town north of Sydney, Australia.  Below the headline were two photos, apparently of the same strip of land, with water on the left and the right. A black-and-white photo was labeled 1917 and a color photo was labeled 2016.  ""For years they called it Global Warming. But they were proven over and over that no such thing is happening,"" the text below the photos said. ""Then they started calling it Climate Change. Again it is a hoax."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post appears to argue that the photos indicate the water level at a particular site didn’t change in 99 years.  Tides rise and fall, of course — even during the course of a day, as well over a period of years. According to experts, photos like these don’t reveal long-term changes in sea level, and globally, sea levels are up, with climate change being the primary reason why. A Google search indicates the two photos are from Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, which is about 17 miles north of Sydney. First Draft, a nonprofit that fights misinformation, told us the black-and-white photo appears to have been taken at Palm Beach and that an Australian government website dates the image as being taken between 1917 and 1946. First Draft could not confirm details about the other photo. Facebook users who clicked on the Palm Beach meme will see it has been marked with a fact-check that Climate Feedback did in 2019. It rated as inaccurate a similar meme with two photos claiming that ""unprecedented climate change"" had caused no rise in sea level at Sydney Harbour in 140 years.  The fact-checkers found that two photos taken at different times cannot reveal whether a sea-level change has occurred, given that tides rise and fall. An expert from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California told Climate Feedback that during the 20th century, the sea level in Sydney rose by about 12 centimeters or just under 5 inches. Jet Propulsion Laboratory reported in May that global warming is adding about 750 gigatonnes of water to the ocean each year. Solely for visualization purposes, that’s enough in one year to cover Texas more than 3 feet deep. Satellite observations from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center reported in October an increase of 3.3 millimeters per year in sea level since 1993. Sea level rose more than 200 millimeters (nearly 8 inches) from 1900 to 2018, according to coastal tide gauge and satellite data. ""Sea level rise is caused primarily by two factors related to global warming: the added water from melting ice sheets and glaciers and the expansion of seawater as it warms,"" NASA said. Sea-level rise is uneven in space and time but on average, sea level is rising because of climate warming caused by humans, said Thomas Frederikse, a postdoctoral fellow at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ""The post is wrong and climate change is all too real."" A Facebook post says two water’s-edge photos, apparently from the same location, show climate change ""is a hoax."" Water’s-edge photographs don’t show changes in sea level over time. Global sea levels are rising, and climate change is one reason",False,"April 21, 2021"
"The shutdown of the Keystone Pipeline project will mean “nearly 2,000 (union jobs lost) with Wisconsin companies”","On his first day in office, President Joe Biden signed an executive order revoking the March 2019 permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline. The pipeline was to carry crude oil from Alberta, Canada, to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with another leg stretching to Gulf Coast refineries. The pipeline is opposed by environmental groups, but had won federal approval under then-President Donald Trump. Construction began in 2020, but only a mile or so of the pipeline had been completed before Biden’s action. His order cited a 2015 review by the Department of State and then-President Barack Obama, which found the pipeline would not serve the U.S. national interest.  In the wake of the order, several Wisconsin politicians criticized the move as a job-killer for, yes, Wisconsin. That’s because two state-based companies had a contract to work on the project. (House Republicans introduced a bill to bring back the pipeline on Feb. 2, 2021). In a Jan. 21, 2021 post on Facebook, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, listed a series of things that would be lost with the end of the project, including ""10,000 union jobs (nearly 2,000 with Wisconsin companies)."" Let’s zero in on the last part. Would ending the pipeline cost nearly 2,000 union jobs with Wisconsin companies? In its November 2015 report, the State Department wrote that only 50 jobs would be required to maintain the pipeline after construction – 35 full-time jobs and 15 contractors. So the majority of the jobs for the Keystone pipeline would be short-term and construction-related. At the time, the report noted the pipeline would lead to 3,900 direct construction jobs. Of course, that number may have risen in the intervening five years, and in claims about the economic impact of projects, secondary-jobs are often considered. When asked for backup, Johnson’s office pointed to two online posts. One post, from Sept. 3, 2020, was by Michels Corporation, based in Brownsville, Wisconsin. The other, dated Jan. 5, 2021, was on the website for the Keystone XL Pipeline, run by TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. (TransCanada is an affiliate of Canada-based TC Energy Corporation, which was to own the pipeline with the Alberta government.) The Michels Corp. post said the company would employ more than 350 people on facilities projects during peak construction. The career page on the company’s web site says Michels offers both union and non-union jobs. The TransCanada/Keystone page includes a quote from Bobby Poteete, president of Precision Pipeline, an Eau Claire-based subsidiary of Florida-based MasTec, Inc.: ""We are extremely proud to put PPL employees and more than 1,600 American union members to work on completing this important infrastructure project…"" Later, that post includes, ""PPL will be responsible for hiring an estimated 1,600 union workers over the two-year construction period."" So over the course of construction, that will be a total of 1,950 jobs – or ""nearly"" 2,000 jobs– provided by Wisconsin companies. We reached out to Michels and Precision Pipeline, but neither responded. The Wisconsin companies were chosen alongside three Texas companies and a Montana company in October 2020 by TC Energy. Johnson’s claim could lead readers to believe the jobs would be permanent, or that 2,000 are already at risk.  But the jobs involved are temporary, construction ones. And the total number would fluctuate over the course of the project. For instance, Michaels said it would be employing the 350 workers only when they reached peak construction.  What’s more, the jobs would also likely be outside of Wisconsin, because the pipeline’s path is through Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska. So, that would lessen the impact on the state of any lost jobs -- and related spending power -- due to Biden’s action. Johnson said in a Facebook post that shutting down the construction of the Keystone pipeline would result in ""nearly 2,000 (union jobs lost) with Wisconsin companies"" Based on the information we could find, the number checks out. Two Wisconsin companies were among the six that have been awarded construction contracts, and roughly 2,000 jobs are involved. That said, readers could have easily understood Johnson to mean permanent jobs, when they would be only temporary. And the total represents a peak, not current jobs",Mostly True,"February 26, 2021"
"“Nobody’s health is at risk right now” from PFAS contamination, as long as they are receiving bottled drinking water","For years, Wisconsin has been grappling with ""forever chemical"" contaminations in some of its towns and cities, making it so residents can’t drink the water from their own wells.  Those chemicals, known as PFAS -- per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances -- have been linked to all kinds of health risks, including types of kidney and testicular cancers, lower birth weights and harm to immune and reproductive systems. PFAS, a large family of man-made chemicals, were once prized for their non-stick characteristics and were used to make non-stick pans, waterproof clothing and other items. They’re also commonly used in fast food wrappers, to keep the grease from leaking out.   The chemicals accumulate in the body over time, meaning the more consumed via food or water, the more is stored in the body.  In Wisconsin, the chemicals have ended up in the soil in many places -- including Marinettte, Peshtigo, Milwaukee and Madison -- due to the use and testing of fire fighting foam used to put out blazes involving gas. In the communities dealing with those contaminations, many residents can no longer drink or cook with the water from their kitchen sink, forcing them to rely on weekly shipments of bottled water, paid for by the polluting party or, in some cases, the state Department of Natural Resources.  Scott Manley, executive vice president for government relations for Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, the state’s largest business lobbying group, during a Jan. 31, 2020, interview about the chemicals on WKOW’s ""Capital City Sunday"" said that residents aren’t put at risk by the contamination if they’re getting the bottled water.  ""People who have wells that test for elevated levels of PFAS are currently being provided clean drinking water at the expense of the responsible party, so nobody’s health is at risk right now,"" he said.  That stopped us. Is it true that there is no risk to people within polluted areas if they’re receiving bottled water shipments for drinking and cooking?  Let’s start with some background. One of the most well-known areas where bottled water has to be provided to residents is in Marinette and Peshtigo in northeastern Wisconsin.  The PFAS in that area originated at the Tyco Fire Products firefighting foam testing facility, which saw outdoor testing of foam up until 2017.  The foam was washed into sanitary sewers after testing, allowing PFAS to leach into the ground. The PFAS in the soil at the testing plant later leached out of the boundaries of the testing facility, carried by groundwater, and have been found in private wells across the area.  Tyco, a subsidiary of Johnson Controls, is paying to provide bottled water or water treatment systems to residents with PFAS in their wells above a certain level and has set aside money to work towards providing the residents with a water system for all affected in the future, in cooperation with the city of Marinette.  When asked for backup to support Manley’s claim, Nick Novak, vice president of communications and marketing for WMC, essentially repeated what Manley said:  ""Parties responsible for elevated levels of specific PFAS substances have supplied affected communities with bottled water or water filtration systems in the near term while working closely with regulators and community members on long-term potable water solutions to ensure no one’s health or safety is put at risk.""  But environmental groups disagree with the assertion that no one’s health is at risk. And various studies also cite known concerns. Carly Michiels, government relations director for Clean Wisconsin, noted that water is not the only thing affected by PFAS contamination. ""There are also considerations like the contaminated biosolids that have been spread on farm fields, or waterways that have contaminated the fish, which would all impact a person’s public health,"" she said. ""Drinking water out of a tap is only one source of exposure in a large PFAS hotspot.""  Biosolids, or the sludge taken out of waste water treatment systems, is typically spread on farm fields, and PFAS can be found in soil in contaminated areas.  Though not yet conclusive, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is studying how crops can absorb PFAS, which could then be consumed and added to the accumulation of the chemicals in a person’s body.  Studies in Wisconsin have shown that PFAS also accumulate in fish, which has resulted in the DNR issuing warnings about consuming fish from certain areas more than once or twice a month. Fish in ponds in Marinette have shown elevated levels of PFAS, according to an October 2020 report from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, as well as fish in Madison lakes and even Lake Superior. Elevated levels of PFAS have also been found in the livers of deer in the Marinette area, prompting the DNR to issue consumption advisories for the organs, according to a September 2020 report in the Journal Sentinel.  So even though residents may have access to clean water via deliveries of bottled water, there is still a risk of consuming contaminated produce, fish or meat from the area, which could contribute to a buildup of PFAS in the body.  Manley claimed that no one’s health is at risk if they’re receiving bottled drinking water due to contamination in their home’s water supply.  While precautions put in place to provide safe drinking water have helped mitigate the problem in the short term, residents can still ingest PFAS through other means, such as meat or fish hunted from nearby land, or possibly even produce harvested from areas where PFAS are present in the soil",False,"February 19, 2021"
Says that Hurricane Harvey “dropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.”,"John Kerry, President Joe Biden's new special envoy on climate, appeared on CNN Jan. 31 to lay out the Biden administration’s whole-of-government approach to addressing climate change.   The cost of taking no action on climate change will far outweigh the price of preventing its worst-case scenario, Kerry argued, pointing to three recent storms — hurricanes Maria, Harvey and Irma — whose damages cost the U.S. a combined $265 billion.   And then Kerry threw out a striking detail: ""Harvey dropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year,"" he said.  It’s true that Hurricane Harvey produced rainfall levels that have never been experienced in the U.S. in recorded history. According to Texas State Climatologist John Nielson-Gammon, the amount of rainfall that fell during a five-day period across 10,000 square miles of Texas and Louisiana exceeded the previous record set in 1899 by 62%.  In Harris County alone, which contains the bulk of the city of Houston, the storm dropped an average 33.7 inches of rainfall across the county’s 1,777 square mile area. But is that amount of rainfall more than the volume of water that flows over Niagara Falls in a full year?  A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of State said that Kerry’s remark was based on a 2017 Washington Post article reporting that Harvey had dumped 24.5 trillion gallons of water on Southeast Texas and southern Louisiana.  The article also mentions, for comparison sake, that 1 trillion gallons of water flows over Niagara Falls every 15 days, and Kerry’s office used that number to extrapolate the amount of water that flows over the falls in a year.  ""A trillion gallons falls over Niagara Falls every 15 days. So, in the course of 365 days, that is about 24.3 trillion gallons of water,"" said state department spokesperson James Dewey. That back-of-the-envelope calculation is correct, and it closely lines up with official estimates. Niagara Falls State Park estimates that 757,500 gallons flow over the falls each second, which is equivalent to 65.4 billion gallons per day, or 23.8 trillion gallons per year.   In either case — be it Kerry’s estimate of 24.3 trillion gallons flowing over Niagara per year or the state park’s 23.8 billion estimate — both figures are less than the 24.5 trillion gallons of water Harvey unleashed.  However, there’s a key detail that Kerry gets wrong.  While it might be true that Hurricane Harvey dropped more water within a week than flows over Niagara Falls in a year, not all of that Harvey water fell on Houston or Harris County alone.   Harvey made landfall near Rockport on Aug. 25, 2017, then drifted eastward over the next several days, dropping torrential rain on the Houston metro area. Three days later, the storm’s center moved back offshore and restrengthened over Matagorda Bay where it gained its peak intensity. Then on Aug. 30, the storm made landfall again in southwestern Louisiana moving northeastward over the southern United States while continuing to produce heavy rainfall.  The majority of the storm’s total rainfall fell over Southeast Texas, where 60 counties were under a disaster declaration, and southern Louisiana, where 13 counties were under a disaster declaration. The storm grew weaker as it moved over Tennessee and Kentucky, where it finally dissipated. Counties in both states issued flash flood warnings as areas received up to 7 inches of rain. All told, the storm had unleashed a grand total of 33 trillion gallons of water.   Kerry’s statement would have been accurate if he had said Harvey dropped more water on Texas and Louisiana, or the southern U.S., over five days — instead of just Houston — than the amount that flows over Niagara Falls in a year.  A 2018 report by the Harris County Flood Control District also made a comparison between the amount of Harvey rainfall and the amount of water that flows over Niagara Falls.   ""A total of 1 trillion gallons of water fell across Harris County over the 4 day period which would fill NRG Stadium 1,472 times and cover Harris County’s 1,777 sq. miles with an average of 33.7 inches of water. This volume of water would also run Niagara Falls for 15 days,"" the report said.  After PolitiFact reached out to Kerry’s office about the misstatement, a spokesperson said that the issue has been brought up to staff and that Kerry would be more careful with that statistic.  ""In a recent interview with Fareed Zakaria on CNN, Secretary Kerry said Hurricane Harvey 'dropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year,'"" a spokesperson said in a statement. ""The statistic Secretary Kerry referenced is for water Hurricane Harvey dropped not just on Houston, but on southeast Texas and southern Louisiana.""    Kerry said on CNN that Hurricane Harvey dropped more water on Houston in five days than the amount of water that flows over Niagara Falls in a year.   By the time Harvey dissipated it had dropped around 33 trillion gallons of water primarily on Texas, Louisiana and, to a lesser extent, Tennessee and Kentucky. By comparison, about 23.8 trillion gallons of water flows over Niagara Falls per year.   Kerry’s comment errs in narrowing Harvey rainfall to Houston, and his office acknowledged the misstatement. In fact, 1 trillion gallons were dumped on Harris County, which would be equivalent to the volume of water that spills over Niagara Falls in 15 days",False,"February 5, 2021"
"""In 2019, Republicans stripped $40 million from the budget for lead pipe replacement - because they thought it helped MKE too much.""","Has Milwaukee’s position as Wisconsin’s largest city as well as a Democratic stronghold put Brewtown in the crosshairs of state Republicans?  State Sen. Chris Larson, D-Milwaukee, alluded to the city’s treatment by Republicans about a week before the election, in an Oct. 26, 2020, tweet marking National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week: ""I'm so glad we have a Governor who cares and wants to help WI cities get to 0% lead piping. Sadly, in 2019, Republicans stripped $40 million from the budget for lead pipe replacement - because they thought it helped MKE too much.""  That caught our attention.  Did Republican lawmakers strip funding from the budget for lead pipe replacement because it would help Milwaukee too much?  Under Evers' plan, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, state officials would have borrowed nearly $40 million over the two-year budget period to create a forgivable loan program for local governments to help pay for lead pipe replacements. The borrowing also would have created a separate grant program that would allow farmers to build infrastructure aimed at reducing pollution and help rid contaminants in the Milwaukee River and St. Louis River, which is in northwest Wisconsin. Evers' proposal would have paid for up to 50 percent of the cost of replacing a lead water service line in Milwaukee, if the city qualified for the state program. According to Milwaukee Water Works, there is no lead in the city’s drinking water when it leaves treatment plants.  But there is a danger in the water -- especially in older homes -- because old service lines, which run to individual houses, and interior plumbing may contain lead, which can leach into the water. The most fundamental solution, in Milwaukee and elsewhere, is to replace the old pipes with copper ones, but other interim steps can make a difference, such as assuring at-risk homes have filters on their taps. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, even low levels of lead in blood have been shown to cause developmental delays and learning difficulties in children. Lead exposure also harms adults, who may suffer high blood pressure, joint pain, headaches and an increased risk of having a miscarriage or premature birth.  As of Dec. 31, 2019, the Milwaukee Water Works reported 74,416 lead service lines within its service area, according to Department of Public Works spokesman Brian DeNeve. About 70,000 of those are residential.  Those 70,000 residential lead service lines account for about 40% of the total statewide.  The proposed $40 million in bonding could have led to the replacement of 9% of the state's 170,000 lead service lines still in use, the Evers administration estimated. When asked to provide backup for Larson’s statement, spokesman Justin Bielinski pointed to news articles detailing GOP objections in the wake of the Evers proposal. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, said the plan was too expensive.  ""I feel like the simple answer was to just say we're going to have government pay for all these lead lateral replacements,"" Vos said, according to an April 10, 2019, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article. ""But the number nationwide is trillions of dollars, which we will never have the ability — at least in Wisconsin — to be able to do things like that everywhere across the state."" In the same article, state Rep. John Nygren, R-Marinette, who co-chairs the Legislature’s budget-writing committee, singled out the Milwaukee funding.   ""My understanding is that the proposal — a vast majority of it — is going to Milwaukee,"" Nygren said. ""We had targeted our response to the lead issue as a local opportunity for communities to get involved and provide assistance at the local level, rather than people from Marinette funding lead replacements in Milwaukee. I'm not sure that that's necessarily fair from a taxpayer standpoint."" Meanwhile, a  video titled ""Milwaukee Tries to Pass the Buck on Lead Lateral Replacement"" posted May 20, 2019 by the MacIver Institute to YouTube, shows Vos praising Madison’s efforts to replace lead laterals on its own, without a state mandate, and notes the laterals are owned by homeowners, not taxpayers. ""The City of Madison did a great job over the past dozen years getting rid of lead laterals on their own without a mandate from the state,"" Vos said.  In the video, Vos says those who have already paid to upgrade their laterals should not have to now pay the cost of replacing laterals owned by others. In its description of the video, the MacIver Institute, a conservative think tank, describes this as a ""handout"" to the city from state taxpayers. In May 2019, the Legislature voted along party lines to remove many of Evers’ most significant proposals from his state budget, including the lead proposal.  So, in short, before striking the money from the budget, several GOP leaders cited the fact too much of it would go to Milwaukee. But they also cited other factors, including questioning whether an effort financed by state taxpayers was an appropriate way to tackle the problem. In a tweet, Larson said ""In 2019, Republicans stripped $40 million from the budget for lead pipe replacement - because they thought it helped MKE too much."" At least two key leaders opposed the program, citing -- in part -- the amount of money that would go to the City of Milwaukee.

Yang had tweeted, ""America is 33rd in access to quality education, 33rd in child mortality and 31st in clean drinking water. But our stock market is up.""

We’ll address them one by one. (Swearengin’s campaign did not respond to inquiries. She eventually lost the election to Capito.) Statistics for K-12 graduation rates differ somewhat, depending on how you measure them, and as we’ve reported previously, no measure is foolproof. Still, West Virginia performs well in a measure that analyzes the ""cohort"" of students entering school in a given year and then follows them to see whether they graduate, adjusting for students who move in and out of the state. By this measure, West Virginia was one of only seven states in the U.S. to reach a 90% graduation rate for the 2017-18 class. Another closely watched metric for K-12 education is the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a national test of scholastic achievement at various grades. In both fourth-grade and eighth-grade math, West Virginia ranked fourth from the bottom among the 50 states in 2019. In fourth-grade reading, West Virginia was ninth from the bottom, and fourth from the bottom among eighth graders. So West Virginia has uniformly poor rankings in national standardized testing. Independent analyses suggest a broadly similar picture. An analysis by U.S. News and World Report, using these statistics and a few others, ranked West Virginia 42nd in the nation overall on K-12 education. Another analysis, by the website WalletHub, used 33 metrics to evaluate schools by state. In the metrics for educational ""quality,"" West Virginia ranked 45th nationally. The metrics we cited above on education are ""reasonable ones to use,"" said David Bills, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Education. The Environmental Protection Agency measures the number of violations by public water systems per 1,000 residents in 2017. West Virginia ranked 46th among the 50 states on this metric that year. The only states ranking lower were Maine, Vermont, Montana and Alaska. According to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, West Virginia ranked fifth worst among the 50 states for child mortality in 2018. The only states with worse rates were South Carolina, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. Swearengin said, ""West Virginia is near last in the U.S."" rankings of education, clean drinking water and child mortality.

“The Green New Deal would require that 99% of homes in the country be torn down and rebuilt more ‘energy efficient’ over a ten year period.”,"When introduced in early 2019, the Green New Deal resolution immediately sparked conversation and intense criticism, some of it stemming from mistakes made by its sponsor during the rollout.  An FAQ distributed to the media by staff for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., one of the Green New Deal sponsors, included language and policies not found in the resolution. The original version of the FAQ, which was quickly retracted, included a goal that continues to attract attention: ""Upgrade or replace every building in U.S. for state-of-art energy efficiency"" over a 10-year-period.   Close to two years later, social media users continue to refer to that now-retracted sentence about replacing buildings. One Instagram post says, ""The Green New Deal would require that 99% of homes in the country be torn down and rebuilt more ‘energy efficient’ over a ten year period."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The original FAQ distributed by Ocasio-Cortez’s staff included references to ""farting cows"" contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and the need to guarantee economic security for those ""unwilling to work,"" which were not included in the resolution.  According to the Washington Post, more than a dozen media outlets reported on policies that were listed in the retracted FAQ but not included in the legislation.. Just this month, President Trump falsely claimed that as part of the Green New Deal, ""They literally want to take buildings down and rebuild them with tiny little windows,"" according to The Hill.   The final version of Ocasio-Cortez’s FAQ removed the language about ""upgrading or replacing every building"" and instead said one of the goals is, ""upgrading virtually every home and building for energy efficiency."" That could be accomplished by replacing items such as windows, doors and insulation, as well as electricity and plumbing systems, according to Curbed. The plan would be for the federal government to provide incentives for homeowners to make those improvements. The think tank that is helping to develop the Green New Deal acknowledges that making those types of changes to some homes, particularly older ones, could expose bigger structural or safety problems, according to Fast Company. The think tank says it is studying those issues and policies that could address them.

"“With regard to hurricanes, the National Oceanic (and Atmospheric) Administration tells us that actually, as difficult as they are, there are no more hurricanes today than there were 100 years ago.”","As Hurricane Delta headed for the Gulf Coast, Vice President Mike Pence downplayed a connection between climate change and natural disasters striking the country, from wildfires to hurricanes. Susan Page, who moderated the Oct. 7 vice presidential debate, asked Pence if he believed, ""as the scientific community has concluded, that man-made climate change has made wildfires bigger, hotter, and more deadly and have made hurricanes wetter, slower and more damaging?"" Pence started his response by saying, somewhat inaccurately, what the Democratic presidential ticket would mean for fracking and the Green New Deal. ""With regard to hurricanes, the National Oceanic Administration tells us that actually, as difficult as they are, there are no more hurricanes today than there were 100 years ago,"" he said. That comment might sound surprising given the busy 2020 hurricane season. Hurricane Delta was Louisiana’s fourth hurricane or tropical storm of the year. And for only the second time in history, forecasters in 2020 used up all 21 of the year’s Atlantic storm names and had to resort to Greek letters.  On the numerical comparison, Pence has a point. Hurricanes that reach U.S. land are happening about as often as they did 100 years ago. But that isn’t all the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other scientists have to say about hurricanes and climate change. Focusing only on the number of storms obscures warnings from NOAA and other scientists about the effect of climate change on future storms.  ""If we are thinking about what to expect in the coming century, it’s not just a matter of extrapolating what we saw in the past century,"" said Gabriel Vecchi, a former NOAA scientist who is now a Princeton University professor. Scientists are more concerned about the intensity of future storms. Phil Klotzbach, a scientist at Colorado State University, said scientists are continuing to disentangle questions about climate change and hurricanes. But it’s clear that skyrocketing population growth along the coast means storms today are more costly and destructive than 100 years ago, and sea level rise means more dangerous flooding from storm surge.  Pence didn’t specify whether he was referring to hurricanes that made landfall around the world, or just in the U.S. (The Trump campaign did not respond to our request for clarification.) The most reliable data is for U.S. landfalling hurricanes, so we’ll start there.  Jeff Masters, meteorologist for Yale Climate Connections, said it is true that the number of U.S. mainland landfalling Atlantic hurricanes has not changed appreciably in the past 100 years. There was one year about a century ago, in 1916, when nine tropical storms or hurricanes hit the mainland U.S. With Hurricane Delta, 10 have hit the U.S. this year. ""We are cruising through names at a record pace, but largely thanks to a lot of weak and/or short-lived ones,"" said Brian McNoldy, a University of Miami hurricane researcher. ""This is in stark contrast to the 2005 season, which also went into the Greek alphabet for the first time but produced many long-lived and very intense hurricanes."" This year’s busy season doesn’t necessarily mean we should expect more storms. ""Computer modeling results of Atlantic hurricanes are inconclusive on whether or not climate change will cause an increase or decrease in the number of Atlantic hurricanes in a future warmer climate, with some models showing a decrease, and some showing an increase,"" Masters said. ""But what theory and modeling do agree upon is that we will see the strongest hurricanes get stronger. Observations suggest that we are already seeing that occur."" Masters pointed to a June 2020 research article by scientists at NOAA and the University of Wisconsin-Madison that looked at global storms from 1979 to 2017. The number of major hurricanes — Category 3 or stronger — increased globally by 15% in the later half of that period. Major hurricanes are significantly more damaging than a Category 1 or 2 storm.  A September NOAA research analysis concluded that future hurricanes will be more intense with higher rainfall rates as a result of global warming. NOAA has said that rising sea levels, another effect of climate change, will increase the threat of storm-surge flooding during hurricanes. Pence said that NOAA said ""there are no more hurricanes today than there were 100 years ago."" The data from NOAA show there’s no major difference between the number of storms today and a century ago. But his statistic doesn’t mean a lot on its own. What matters more is the intensity of hurricanes, and how climate change and sea level rise will affect future intensity",Half True,"October 14, 2020"
Video from 2019 shows Kamala Harris “caught in a major lie” about fracking during the 2020 vice presidential debate.,"An article shared widely on Facebook wrongly claims that Sen. Kamala Harris was ""caught in a major lie"" over Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s position on fracking. The Oct. 7 article from the Western Journal, a conservative news and political commentary website, says Harris’ comments during the Oct. 7 vice presidential debate flew in the face of ""a history of promises"" she and Biden had made to ban hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The article juxtaposes Harris’s comment during the vice presidential debate with a much different comment the California senator made more than a year earlier. Other Facebook posts that drew similar traffic have paired video footage of the two comments back to back. ""Joe Biden will not end fracking,"" Harris said during the debate, in response to Vice President Mike Pence’s false claim to the contrary. ""He has been very clear about that."" ""There’s no question, I’m in favor of banning fracking,"" Harris said some 13 months earlier, in response to an activist’s question during a Sept. 4, 2019, town hall hosted by CNN. Taken side by side, the two quotes show two different positions. But that doesn’t mean she was lying during the vice presidential debate. There’s a key detail that explains her shift: Harris is now Biden’s running mate, meaning she is tied to his platform. When she made the initial comment in 2019, she was a primary presidential candidate running against Biden and vying for the party’s nomination with her own positions.   Biden’s official campaign platform does not call for a ban on fracking, although the former vice president’s past comments from the campaign trail have led to some confusion on his stance. During a March debate with Sen. Bernie Sanders, for example, Biden said he supported ""no new fracking"" — a comment his campaign later clarified, saying he was only referring to his stated policy calling for a ban on new permits for oil and gas drilling on federally owned lands.  George Upper, the Western Journal’s editor in chief, pointed in an email to other comments Biden has made that appeared to reflect an anti-fracking stance, such as a moment where he told an activist in September 2019, ""I guarantee you, we’re going to end fossil fuel.""  ""Harris is on the record with multiple similar statements,"" Upper said. But Biden’s plan isn’t as simple as he’s sometimes made it seem. After he said during a July 2019 debate that he would ""work (fossil fuels) out,"" his campaign clarified that he supports eliminating subsidies for fossil fuels and a gradual shift toward clean energy with the goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Both proposals are listed on his campaign website. According to Biden’s campaign website, he supports ""banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters."" PolitiFact has fact-checked several statements — including false claims from President Donald Trump and his reelection campaign — about Biden and fracking. Biden says that he won’t shut down existing fracking operations on public land, and that he’ll allow fracking to continue on private lands, where most of it takes place. Regardless, Harris was speaking for her own candidacy in 2019 when she said she was in favor of banning fracking.

The video then shows a screenshot of Biden’s climate action plan, which calls the deal a ""crucial framework"" for acting on climate challenges. The TikTok user holds up a sign calling Biden a ""liar.""  Interrupted repeatedly by President Donald Trump, Biden struggled during the debate to explain where he stood on the Green New Deal.  ""The Green New Deal is not my plan,"" he said. Shortly after that, he said the Green New Deal would ""pay for itself as we move forward.""  When pressed by moderator Chris Wallace, Biden responded, ""No, I don’t support the Green New Deal."" Biden went on to say that he supports ""the Biden plan that I put forward … which is different."" In the Oct. 7 vice presidential debate, Biden’s running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, was also pressed on the issue, with Vice President Mike Pence calling the Biden plan a ""$2 trillion version of the Green New Deal"" and noting that Harris cosponsored a Green New Deal resolution in the Senate. Harris advocated for the Green New Deal in 2019, when she was a presidential candidate. When moderator Susan Page asked specifically for the Biden-Harris campaign’s view on the Green New Deal, Harris didn’t give a direct answer, and she pivoted to discussing investments in clean-energy jobs.  Biden’s campaign didn’t return requests for comment. But essentially, Biden has claimed that he doesn’t ""support"" the Green New Deal as is. Rather, he has said, he used it as a framework to build his own plan.  So what makes Biden’s plan different? Let’s start by looking at the Green New Deal.  The Green New Deal was a 2019 House resolution sponsored by Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. On its own, it would not have changed any laws. Rather, it listed a variety of climate change and environmental justice goals — such as universal access to clean water, resiliencies against extreme weather, and pollution and carbon emission reductions ""as much as technologically feasible.""  It called on federal lawmakers to enact a 10-year ""national mobilization"" plan to achieve those goals, and said the world needs net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 to prevent severe impacts of climate change.  Biden’s climate plan echoes some of that language, but differs significantly in scope. For example, it also calls for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. But it’s missing some of the environmental justice goals the Green New Deal included. While Biden may share these goals, his climate plan doesn’t specifically include calls for universal access to high-quality health care and affordable housing.  Biden’s climate action plan gives a nod to the Green New Deal as ""a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face."" According to his website, the plan borrows ""two basic truths"" from the Green New Deal: that the U.S. needs to be more ambitious, and that the environment and economy are connected.  The TikTok post claimed that text on Joe Biden’s campaign website proves that he supports the Green New Deal, despite his denials in the first presidential debate.  Biden’s plan shares some of the Green New Deal’s goals, and he has acknowledged that his plan was inspired by it. But his plan differs in scope",Half True,"October 8, 2020"
The man in a mugshot is “responsible for lighting 32 of the wildfires” on the West Coast.,"Conspiracy theories about the dangerous wildfires burning in California, Oregon and Washington have thrived on social media.  A new rumor on Facebook suggests that environmental factors connected to climate change, like severe heat and drought, have nothing to do with the fires. Instead the post pins much of the destruction on one man. The Sept. 20 post features the man’s mugshot and implores users to ""meet mr. climate change"" and says he’s ""responsible for lighting 32 of the wildfires.""  The man in the image, Brandon McGlover, did light fires in California, and he was arrested and sentenced for it — but it happened in 2018, and there weren’t 32 fires. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In July 2018, deputies from the Riverside County Sheriff's Department in California arrested Brandon N. McGlover on charges of five counts of arson to wildland. (The amount of fires linked to McGlover was later upped to nine.) One of the fires McGlover was accused of setting became the Cranston Fire, which destroyed multiple buildings, forced thousands of evacuations, and burned over 13,000 acres before it was fully contained. Contemporaneous news reports said that a heat wave in California exacerbated the fire’s spread. McGlover pleaded guilty to arson charges for the Cranston Fire in 2019 and was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Fire officials and experts believe that the West Coast’s 2020 wildfire season has been mostly fueled by a combination of severe drought, historic heat, lightning storms and heavy winds.  There are a couple of exceptions. A man was arrested on charges of arson and cultivating marijuana in connection with California’s Dolan Fire, and officials said San Bernardino County’s El Dorado Fire was caused by a device at a gender reveal party. A post suggests climate change has nothing to do with the fires burning in the Western U.S., blaming instead one man for setting 32 wildfires. That isn’t true.

Map shows that wildfires stop at the US.-Canada border.,"Some social media users are using a map of wildfires in the United States to illustrate a political point: that the flames can’t be caused by climate change because they stop at the nation’s borders.  The map shows red markers depicting where fires are burning in the states.

""The answer is simple: because US maps only show US data."" The natural resources department in Canada keeps updated information about the wildfires in its country here. As of Sept. 9, the last time the ""National Wildland Fire Situation Report"" was updated, there were five uncontrolled fires, 11 that weren’t anticipated to grow considering the current circumstances, and 47 controlled fires, meaning they’re contained and will be extinguished.  ""Following a years-long series of extreme wildland fire seasons, 2020 has been one of Canada’s quietest since the 1990s,"" the agency says on its website.  In the United States, meanwhile, 87 large, active fires have burned more than 4.6 million acres in 10 states, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Only four fires are contained.  Hayhoe also addressed this difference between the two countries in a Twitter thread addressing ""popular wildfire myths."" She said that while Canada has fewer wildfires ""at the moment,"" it will have more than the U.S. at another point. ""That’s weather, a single day, week or year.

Online, people are arguing about what caused the fires — poor forest management, arsonists, or global warming. Most wildfires in the lower 48 states are ignited by humans, but they’re burning a much greater area due to drier conditions caused by climate change, Hayhoe said.    As we’ve previously reported, climate change has affected the environments where the fires are burning on the West Coast right now, making them more conducive to wildfire.

"West Coast wildfires are due to “bad forest maintenance,” not climate change.","At a rally in Nevada on Sep. 12, President Trump claimed that the wildfires currently raging across the West Coast have resulted from poor ""forest management.""

We rated these statements False for being overly simplistic and reducing a complex issue to a single cause.   A Facebook post parrots Trump’s language, dismissing the possibility that global warming has contributed to the fires. ""Climate change my a--,"" it reads. ""CA fires are due to total lack of forest maintenance.""  Another post makes a similar claim: ""Bad forestry practices and 60 yr. old power lines caused the Calif. fires not the climate change hoax.""  The wildfires, which include some of the largest infernos in the recorded history of the Western U.S., have claimed 35 lives so far and washed the skies of West Coast cities in orange.  We asked experts what’s fueling them — poor forest maintenance or human-caused climate change. They agreed that while good forest maintenance is critical to mitigating wildfires, it’s climate change that’s making them burn so forcefully. Climatologists, ecologists and wildfire experts all told us that climate change has not only fueled the fires but also worsened their impact.  The regional climate has warmed considerably over the last few years, with 2014-18 being California’s five hottest years on record. In the last four decades, the area burned by wildfires has expanded tenfold. According to Noah Diffenbaugh, a climate scientist at Stanford University, ""about half"" of that increase is attributable to the effects of global warming.  There are many lines of evidence that climate change has exacerbated the likelihood of fires by modifying environments across the region. Climate change has raised overall temperatures along the West Coast, contributed to a long period of drought, reduced snow deposits in the mountains, and dried out vegetation, essentially covering forest floors with fuel. All of these developments have increased the risk of wildfires and the probability that they spread over great distances.  An article in Science written by a group of researchers breaks down this process in detail. Simply put, forests in mountainous regions of the Western U.S. get moisture during the spring and summer months from melting snowpacks. The warming of the climate has led to drought, which means that there’s less snow on the ground left over from the winter. Since temperatures are now rising earlier in the year, the already reduced amount of snow melts much quicker than it used to, leaving dried out twigs, pine needles and grasses on the forest floor. All of this dehydrated vegetation essentially turns forests into big tinderboxes, increasing their flammability. Climate change has also made other types of ecosystems more likely to catch fire. Rising temperatures have lowered the amount of vapor in the air, which leads the atmosphere to suck more moisture out of the soil, drying it out and making it more conducive to wildfires.  Under these conditions, all environments in the Western U.S. have become more likely to catch fire during ignition events like lightning strikes, heavy winds, downed power lines, or sparks from pyrotechnic devices, such as those used in a gender reveal party blamed for a fire in Yucaipa, Calif. ""There are always accidental sparks, but the conditions don’t favor extremely large wildfires all the time,"" said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA. ""As the background conditions shift in that direction, it’s much more likely for these sparks to start a catastrophic blaze."" A study published in August 2020 by Diffenbaugh, Swain and their colleagues found that the number of days per year with extreme wildfire weather in California has more than doubled since the early 1980s, primarily due to increased dryness in the soil.  Wildfires ""are increasing in their likelihood,"" said Diffenbaugh. ""They’re increasing in their intensity. And managing those risks requires an acknowledgement that the climate is warming."" The role of climate change in making wooded areas more flammable doesn’t negate the importance of forest management. There are a number of steps forestry departments can take to decrease the risk of widespread fires, including thinning out small trees, setting strategic burns to prevent the buildup of dry vegetation, and clearing brush.  Swain said that a strict fire suppression policy set by federal forest agencies has likely contributed to the frequency of intense forest fires. Small, contained fires actually lower the risk of high-intensity fires by burning through dry fuel collected on the forest floor. However, many federal agencies followed a policy of extinguishing all fires, regardless of their scope. In doing so, they inadvertently allowed dry vegetation to pile up, increasing the likelihood of massive infernos like the ones we’re seeing. Trump has blamed California agencies for poor forest management, but the state owns just 2% of forest land in the state, while the federal government owns upwards of 60%. The sharp increase in the frequency of wildfires over a wide range of locations can’t be explained by forest management practices alone. Swain noted that the majority of wildfires actually aren’t forest fires at all. ""Most fires aren’t burning trees, they’re burning other forms of vegetation,"" he said. ""Forest management isn’t relevant unless you live in a forest."" Many of the experts we spoke with were frustrated by the way that the debate over the West Coast fires has been framed. Claiming that either poor forest management or climate change is the single factor behind the wildfires doesn’t capture the fact that they are complex phenomena that result from a confluence of conditions.  ""It’s really inaccurate to attempt to reduce the rising occurrence of large, highly destructive wildfires to one ingredient alone,"" Diffenbaugh said.  Climate change has already ensured that fires will occur at a higher intensity and frequency than they did in the past, and forest management is one of the most important techniques that the West Coast can use to cope with that reality.  ""We have to adapt to climate change, and forest management is part of that set of tools that we can use,"" said Susan Prichard, a fire ecologist at the University of Washington.  Viral Facebook posts dismiss the possibility that climate change is fueling the West Coast wildfires, instead citing ""bad forestry practices"" and ""a total lack of forest maintenance."" Experts told us that climate change has undoubtedly contributed to the frequency, intensity and scope of wildfires along the West Coast, and that forest maintenance can be used to mitigate those effects in forests",False,"September 15, 2020"

It has racked up thousands of shares on Facebook and Twitter A United Nations spokesperson told PolitiFact that the document and the agenda it outlined is false. ""This is not an authentic U.N. document,"" the spokesperson said in an email. (AFP and BuzzFeed have previously fact checked this photo and deemed it false.) The post refers to two numbers — 21 and 2030 — that are connected to actual U.N. documents. ""Agenda 21"" is a non-binding plan of action that was created at the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro. It examines the connection between environmental, social and economic issues affecting communities world-wide, and proposes solutions for sustainable development and combating poverty, with private-sector involvement. It calls for strengthening the role of women, local leaders, workers, farmers, entrepreneurs and even private business and industry in promoting sustainable development. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was adopted by each country in the U.N. in 2015. The agenda includes 17 sustainable-development goals that are to be achieved over 15 years, including ending poverty and hunger, achieving gender equality, combating climate change, and ensuring access to clean water and affordable energy.  There are some common threads between the goals in the 2030 U.N. plan and what’s listed in the Facebook post, but in each case, the post exaggerates or distorts them.  For example, the U.N.’s 2030 agenda proposes a goal of reducing the rates of child and maternal mortality in every country. This goal supports research and development of vaccines and medicines for diseases primarily affecting developing countries, according to the U.N. But it doesn’t call for ""mandatory multiple vaccines"" or ""the ban of natural non synthetic drugs and naturopathic medicine"" as the Facebook post claims.  Similarly, the U.N. agenda advocates for free, suitable and quality primary and secondary education and lifelong learning opportunities. But it says nothing about ""government owned and controlled schools.""  The U.N. agenda includes ensuring universal access to ""affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy,"" not the end of private transportation or fossil fuels, as the Facebook post says. The caption on the post invokes the term ""plandemic"" to suggest that the COVID-19 crisis is aligned with the purported U.N. agenda. ""Plandemic"" is the title of a 26-minute video airing various conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 crisis.

"Says Joe Biden plans to “mandate net-zero carbon emissions for homes, offices and all new buildings by 2030. That basically means no windows, no nothing.”","At a Rose Garden speech on July 14, President Donald Trump made multiple attacks on Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, saying his policies went too far left. One of those attacks included an accusation that task force recommendations from Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders included a mandate that would get rid of windows on buildings. Trump said that Biden plans to ""mandate net-zero carbon emissions for homes, offices and all new buildings by 2030. That basically means no windows, no nothing."" The Biden-Sanders recommendations set a goal for having all new buildings achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. They don't say anything about a mandate. The plan also doesn’t mention windows — and the presence of windows in a building does not mean that a building can’t achieve net-zero carbon emissions. The White House and Trump’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment. The Biden and Sanders task force recommends setting a goal to reduce buildings’ impact on climate change, but not a mandate. This is what the task force recommendation says: ""We will set a bold, national goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions for all new buildings by 2030.""  That target is included in Biden’s sustainable energy and infrastructure plan, which his campaign released July 14. The plan seeks to achieve a ""net-zero emissions standard for all new commercial buildings by 2030.""  The Energy Department defines ""zero energy buildings"" as those that ""combine energy efficiency and renewable energy generation to consume only as much energy as can be produced onsite through renewable resources over a specified time period."" Residential and commercial buildings contributed to 35% of U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in 2019, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Biden plans to invest in companies to incentivize them to update four million buildings to make them more efficient, according to the task force recommendations. In addition, the task force expects Democrats to work on state and city levels to make buildings more energy efficient. The Green New Deal, a far-reaching climate proposal introduced in February 2019 by Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., set out to upgrade all buildings in the U.S. to make them as energy efficient as possible. The plan wasn’t brought to a vote in the House and failed to advance in the Senate. Biden’s clean energy and environmental justice plan, released in June 2019, called the Green New Deal ""a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face."" The Democrats’ task force document doesn’t mention windows at all, and buildings with windows can have net-zero emissions. Steve Capanna, director of U.S. Climate Policy and Analysis at the Environmental Defense Fund said that Trump’s claim that Biden and Sanders want to get rid of windows is ""preposterous."" ""President Trump’s claim is not accurate,"" Capanna said. ""The Biden-Sanders team certainly is not proposing eliminating windows."" Capanna said that Biden’s target is ambitious, but there are already programs in place that push for energy efficient buildings. Those plans include measures for efficient windows. The Energy Department’s Zero Energy Ready Home program certifies homes that have more energy-efficient heating and cooling, insulation, and water distribution systems. The department also certifies zero-energy commercial buildings. The agency and the Environmental Protection Agency have a related program to encourage energy-efficient products and practices that includes guidelines for energy-efficient windows. Efforts to make buildings more energy-efficient don’t center around getting rid of windows. Rather, they include using ""sufficiently insulated windows,"" as outlined by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Capanna said that older, less efficient windows can let warm or cool air escape a building. That contributes to energy loss, ""which means you have to heat the building more."" However, improvements that made windows more efficient in recent years include having multiple panes and allowing in more natural light, which reduces the need for artificial light, Capanna said. Trump said that the Biden-Sanders task force ""mandate net-zero carbon emissions for homes, offices and all new buildings by 2030. That basically means no windows, no nothing."" Biden has a net-zero emissions goal for new buildings by 2030, but his plan doesn’t mention a mandate. Neither the task force recommendation nor Biden’s new climate plan say anything about getting rid of windows, and net-zero emissions buildings can have windows (and many do).

"“Even so-called moderate Democrats like Joe Biden have endorsed a ban on fracking, which would eliminate 516,000 Michigan jobs and reduce the state’s gross domestic product by $159 billion over five years.”","Paul Junge — one of several Republican candidates looking to unseat U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Holly — touts fracking as a boon to Michigan’s economy and is attacking Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden for his stance on the energy extraction method.  On his campaign website, Junge claims ""moderate Democrats like Joe Biden have endorsed a ban on fracking, which would eliminate 516,000 Michigan jobs and reduce the state’s gross domestic product by $159 billion over five years."" Hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking,"" is a method of releasing oil and gas from shale rock underground by injecting water, sand and chemicals. It has provided an economic boost for some areas of the Midwest, but environmental officials and advocates are concerned about its impact on local water supplies, air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Michigan, home to the large Antrim Shale formation, has not seen significant uptake of fracking activity. Voters may have a chance to decide whether it can continue at all if advocates of a fracking ban succeed in reviving a proposed ballot initiative. Polls suggest voters are divided on the issue.  Many Democrats have been critical of fracking on environmental grounds and call for a shift away from fossil fuels, but Junge, a former TV news anchor, exaggerates both Biden’s position on fracking and the impact banning fracking would have on Michigan’s economy. While Biden has called for a ban on new permits for fracking on federal land and waters, he has not supported a ban on fracking on private or state land. As evidence for the claim, Junge’s campaign provided the transcript of a March 2020 Democratic debate in which Biden said ""no new fracking,"" and then added, ""no more drilling on federal lands.""  Following the debate, a Biden campaign spokesperson clarified that Biden wants a ban only on new fracking activities on federal lands and waters. PolitiFact rated a Facebook claim that Biden ""announced on CNN he will completely shut down drilling for oil and natural gas on day one of his administration"" as Mostly False.  The Junge campaign said that a ban on fracking would eliminate 516,000 Michigan jobs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that only 1,577 workers in Michigan were employed in natural-gas extraction, oil and gas drilling, and related support activities in 2019.  David Foster, a former Energy Department official and distinguished associate at the Washington-based Energy Futures Initiative, notes that the data does not differentiate between fracking and conventional oil and gas production.  A supplemental survey conducted for a report on energy employment in the U.S. that Foster wrote found an additional 1,600 people involved in natural-gas fuels in Michigan. This includes professional services jobs, such as accountants, primarily servicing the oil and gas activities identified by the Bureau of Labor Statistics data.  Taken together, the oil and natural-gas sector employs fewer than 3,200 workers in Michigan.  While fracking may not employ many workers in the state, home heating needs and energy-intensive manufacturing in Michigan make the state’s economy sensitive to changes in the energy market. Still, it is unlikely a ban on fracking would cost the state’s economy more than 500,000 jobs and billions of dollars in economic activity over the next five years.  The job- and GDP-loss estimates cited by Junge come from a report by the Global Energy Institute at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington.  The institute uses an economic-impact analysis model to measure how employment and economic activity statewide would change as a result of a ban on fracking. The analysis makes several assumptions to arrive at the job and GDP figures.  First, it assumes that a ban on fracking would result in higher energy prices for consumers and businesses, forcing them to spend more on energy and less on other items such as household goods or investment. Second, it assumes there won’t be any major structural shift in the U.S. energy market over the next five years except for this increase in energy prices. Third, it assumes the higher prices would create some ""windfall"" effect for select producers, boosting some households’ income and spending power.  But researchers are skeptical of using such a model to analyze the potential macroeconomic impact of a fracking ban on a state’s economy.  Tim Bartik, senior economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, believes the institute’s analysis makes unrealistic assumptions that overstate the impact of a ban on fracking.  The method assumes that neither consumers nor businesses would adapt to any price increases. As Bartik explains, this would mean that ""no one adjusts to the banning of fracking, except that prices go up to allocate the reduced supply of energy, the extra funds spent on energy then apparently disappear to Mars, and this reduction in income, in turn, reduces demand mechanically for all other goods and services."" The authors of the institute report said the economy eventually would adjust to higher prices, but evidence of that adjustment would not appear until several years after a ban.  By then, they predict, the U.S. economy would tank, suffering more than a 10% reduction to employment and economic output with the loss of 19 million jobs and $7.1 trillion in GDP. Michigan alone would take a five-year hit to its GDP that amounts to a third of its 2019 economic output, they estimate.  These are ""some incredible numbers,"" Bartik said. Junge said, ""Even so-called moderate Democrats like Joe Biden have endorsed a ban on fracking, which would eliminate 516,000 Michigan jobs and reduce the state’s gross domestic product by $159 billion over five years."" Biden miscommunicated his stance in a debate, but the campaign clarified his position, which the Junge campaign is distorting. Biden supports a ban on new fracking on federal lands and waters, not a total ban.  Meanwhile, the job and GDP loss projections Junge cites come from an analysis that researchers say overstates the impact of a ban on fracking.  The campaign did not respond to a request for further comment",Mostly False,"June 19, 2020"
Says Donald Trump has opposed plans to clean up “Toxic chemicals that cause cancer (that) are in the water …. (and) put Wisconsin at risk.”,"For years, states across the country have waged a battle against the ""forever chemicals"" that have leached into water used for drinking.  The technical term is per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances -- or, in the political lexicon, PFAS. Federal lawmakers have been pushing for regulation of the chemicals, despite indications that President Donald Trump may veto a bill that would designate the chemicals as hazardous substances and regulate their cleanup. That became the target of a television ad, which began airing in mid-May 2020, from the League of Conservation Voters. The ad features Elizabeth Neary, a pediatrician and public health advocate, standing in front of a backdrop featuring trees and a body of water. The ad features news clippings from Wisconsin publications and maps of contamination sites, while she says, in part: ""Toxic chemicals that cause cancer are in the water right here. There are dozens of water danger zones like it that put Wisconsin at risk. The plans to clean it up were opposed by Donald Trump. … Donald Trump has real consequences for our health.""  So, does Trump oppose such cleanup plans? It’s more complicated than it seems. He could well block the current bill, but in December 2019 signed a bill that included legislation on PFAS.  Let’s dig in. ""Forever"" chemicals remain in the environment and the human body and don’t break down over time, hence their nickname, according to an April 27, 2020 article from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.  There are more than 5,000 of the compounds, linked to cancer or other health issues, that collect in the human body, either through the consumption of food or water containing the chemicals.  PFAS are used for their water- and stain-resistant qualities, in products such as clothing and carpets, nonstick cookware, packaging and firefighting foams. Though PFAS are generally no longer in use, they remain in the environment, and cause contamination issues.  When we asked the League of Conservation Voters for comment, they provided citations for all of the claims in the video, including several sources that pointed to the evidence of the chemicals in the state.  One of the most notable PFAS sites in Wisconsin is near Marinette, where Johnson Controls/Tyco tests fire fighting foams. The company stopped testing the foams outdoors in 2017, and now has a system to ensure that the foam is not flushed into sewers or bodies of water after tests. PFAS have also been found in Madison and Milwaukee near airports where military units use fire fighting foam containing PFAS.  There is really no dispute PFASs are there and need attention. Thus, the focus of this fact-check is on the League’s claims about Trump’s position.  H.R. 535, also known as the PFAS Action Act, was proposed in January 2019, according to congress.gov and passed 247-159 by the U.S. House in January 2020. The yes votes were primarily Democrats, while the no votes were primarily Republicans.  There has been no action scheduled on the bill in the U.S. Senate, where it waits in committee. If the Republican-controlled Senate passed the bill, it would go to Trump. But the Trump administration has already signalled opposition to the bill. Indeed, in the ad, a news clipping is shown, referring specifically to the bill, and the administration’s response letter.  In a Jan. 7, 2020 statement of policy, the administration says the bill would create significant risk of lawsuits, set unreasonable timelines and precedents and impose hefty costs on federal, state and local governments.  The statement suggests that decisions regarding the regulation of PFAS be left to the Environmental Protection Agency:  ""The regulatory process works best when EPA and other agencies are free to devise regulations based on the best available science and careful consideration of all the relevant facts.""  So, Trump’s administration has stated opposition to this bill. But is it the only piece of PFAS-related legislation? No. In December 2019, Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020, which included action on PFAS.  The law requires companies where PFAS are manufactured or used to track and collect data on the chemicals and establishes some limits for them, in addition to requiring testing of drinking water wells, according to the EPA website.  The act also added some types of PFAS to the Toxic Release Inventory, which is a public database of toxic chemical releases and pollution prevention activities reported by companies. The act directs that PFAS contamination be addressed in both communities and near military bases, a common source of the chemicals, according to a March 20 Bloomberg Law analysis.  In an ad that aired in Wisconsin, the League of Conservation Voters claimed Trump has opposed plans to clean up ""toxic chemicals that cause cancer (that) are in the water …. (and) put Wisconsin at risk."" Trump’s administration is opposed to the pending PFAS Action Act, and the ad made clear that is the measure it was referring to. That said, he has signed another measure that addresses the chemicals. Indeed, some parts of the proposed law overlap with what was signed",Half True,"June 12, 2020"
"""Bill Gates worked to end livestock production, and is pushing lab grown meat.""","Billionaire philanthropist and Microsoft founder Bill Gates is the target of yet another widespread Facebook post, this time for his support of efforts to create climate-friendly meat replacements. ""Bill Gates worked to end livestock production, and is pushing lab grown meat,"" said a May 4 Facebook post. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In this case, the post is accurate in one way and misleading in another. Gates has invested in numerous companies working to make meat substitutes using plant-based ingredients and, in some cases, laboratory technology. But we found no evidence that Gates has worked to wipe out livestock production. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation did not respond to a request for comment. News reports from the last several years indicate that Gates has at different times invested in start-ups focused on developing artificial or plant-based alternatives to meat, such as Nature’s Fynd, Hampton Creek, Memphis Meats, Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods.  Impossible Foods, for example, makes burger patties that use soy and potatoes for protein. The patties get their flavor from heme, an iron-rich molecule found in meat and plants that sparked some controversy but was approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration. According to the Washington Post, the company’s heme ""is made by taking the DNA from the roots of soy plants, inserting it into genetically engineered yeast and then fermenting that yeast."" Other companies are even more lab-oriented. Memphis Meats uses biotechnology to grow meat in what its website describes as a four-to-six-week process that involves ""sourcing high-quality cells from animals"" and ""cultivat(ing) the cells into meat."" ""Gates has indeed invested in several non-animal alt-protein companies, including Memphis Meats, which grows real meat from animal cells,"" said Paul Shapiro, author of ""Clean Meat: How Growing Meat Without Animals Will Revolutionize Dinner and the World."" In an October interview with Bloomberg News, Gates celebrated Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat for their plant-based meat substitutes. He said he had invested in both and that their products will contribute to a ""dramatic reduction in methane emissions, animal cruelty, manure management and the pressure that meat consumption puts on land use."" He’s made similar points on his personal blog, GatesNotes, writing in one post that a rising population requires more food and that farming livestock can take a toll on the environment and require increased deforestation to make room for the animals.  Livestock are responsible for 14.5% of greenhouse gas emissions each year, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. ""Raising meat takes a great deal of land and water and has a substantial environmental impact,"" Gates wrote in a 2013 blog post. ""Put simply, there’s no way to produce enough meat for (a future population of) 9 billion people. Yet we can’t ask everyone to become vegetarians."" ""That’s why we need more options for producing meat without depleting our resources,"" he said. We found no proof that Gates has worked to end livestock production completely. ""He's never said his goal is to end livestock production, and he actually funds some projects to boost livestock-rearing in developing countries,"" Shapiro said. Shapiro cited the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s agricultural development efforts and a news article detailing $40 million the foundation put toward research and projects to breed cows that produce more milk. ""If you care about the poor, you should care about agriculture, and if you care about agriculture, you care about livestock,"" Gates said in 2018, according to Reuters. ""What that means in this context is helping poor farmers get as much as possible out of their animals."" The foundation has also paid out a number of related grants, according to its website, such as a nearly $8 million grant to the International Livestock Research Institute in November to help ""advocate for investment in livestock development globally,"" among other things. We searched Google and the Nexis database and found no credible reports showing Gates has worked to end livestock production or said he would like to do so. On the contrary, Gates wrote in his blog that if he were living in extreme poverty, he would raise chickens. In another post, he said that despite the implications on the climate, ""We can’t simply get rid of soil — or stop growing crops, using fertilizer, and raising livestock."" A Facebook post said ""Bill Gates worked to end livestock production, and is pushing lab grown meat."" Gates has invested at different times in several companies working to make meat replacements.

But in this case, the Facebook post has some truth to it.

Also, it was a reference to one specific beach in the state, as explained in the story. The Facebook post cites a May 9 article by Florida Today about the amount of garbage found on Cocoa Beach once restrictions were lifted. Starting in late March and then April, the city of Cocoa Beach posted rules that significantly limited use of the beach including the hours, parking and group sizes. But in recent weeks those rules were loosened -- and that’s when the garbage piled up. The city has a contract with Keep Brevard Beautiful to pick up litter on about a five-mile stretch of Cocoa Beach. Typically, they collect  between 30 and 50 bags per day, executive director Bryan Bobbitt told PolitiFact. Each bag weighs 40 to 50 pounds. On Friday, May 1, the organization collected about 33 bags.

Most of the trash was in trash cans or bagged next to trash cans, he said, however a significant amount was picked up directly from the beach itself.  The police department announced it would fine violators $250 for littering. A headline said ""beachgoers trash Florida beaches with 13,000 pounds of litter after beaches reopen.""  That referred to the amount of garbage collected during the first weekend in May at Cocoa Beach.

“Even President Trump’s own EPA has admitted that this rule (on air pollutants) threatens to cause serious health problems including brain damage and death and to inflict billions of dollars of economic damage on our struggling economy.”,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi claimed that as Americans grapple with the coronavirus pandemic, President Donald Trump’s administration has weakened public health protections. ""While tens of thousands of Americans are dying from the coronavirus pandemic, the president is yet again seeking to unleash toxic pollution and dirty air into our communities,"" Pelosi said April 16. ""Even President Trump’s own EPA has admitted that this rule threatens to cause serious health problems including brain damage and death and to inflict billions of dollars of economic damage on our struggling economy."" Pelosi referenced an April 16 decision by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to change how it evaluates the benefits and costs of regulating hazardous air pollutants from power plants fired by coal and oil. The agency concluded that the economic benefits of reducing mercury emissions under an Obama-era rule do not outweigh the costs to the power plants of complying with the rules. PolitiFact looked into Pelosi’s claim that even Trump’s EPA said the new rule would be bad for public health and cost billions of dollars. The facts are more nuanced than Pelosi said. The main pollutant at issue is mercury due to its impact on public health. When mercury released into the air by power plants reaches bodies of water, it is converted by micro-organisms into methylmercury, a highly toxic substance that builds up in fish.  The most common way people are exposed to mercury is by eating fish contaminated with methylmercury. Some fish have higher levels of mercury that, when consumed, can be harmful to an unborn child, a young child’s developing nervous system, the elderly, people with underlying health conditions, and people who eat a lot of fish. The EPA regulates emissions of air toxics from coal- and oil-fired power plants under the Clean Air Act. The Obama administration added Mercury and Air Toxic Standards that set federal air pollution limits for power plants, seeking to reduce emissions of mercury and other toxic air pollutants.  The Obama administration estimated that the standards would prevent, annually, up to 11,000 premature deaths, more than 100,000 asthma attacks, about 4,700 heart attacks, reduce hospital and emergency room visits, and hundreds of thousands of days missed from work due to illness. It projected that the compliance cost to the power plant industry would be about $9.6 billion a year, while the financial value of air quality improvements could range from $37 billion to $90 billion annually. The benefits calculation under the Obama administration included ""co-benefits,"" which occur when regulation compliance also reduces a pollutant that is not the rule’s primary target. The vast majority of the financial benefits came from a reduction of particulate matter, which can lead to serious health problems. The direct quantified benefit of reducing mercury alone — the intended target — was up to $6 million a year. The Trump administration reviewed analyses done by the Obama administration and decided to take ""co-benefits"" out of the equation. Ultimately, it said that the financial benefits of the Obama rule totaled $4 million to $6 million annually (when accounting for reduction of mercury alone), while the annual cost of compliance was $7.4 billion to $9.6 billion. As a result, the EPA under Trump said it ""determined that it is not ‘appropriate and necessary’ to regulate hazardous air pollutant emissions from power plants under section 112 of the Clean Air Act."" The rule limiting emission of mercury and air toxics remained in place. The objection Pelosi is talking about stems from a report by the EPA’s Science Advisory Board. The board is an independent committee that advises the EPA administrator on the information that is used to develop the agency’s rules. Board members serve as special government employees, but their views do not reflect the views of the EPA, an agency spokesperson told us.  On April 9, the board advised the EPA to do a new assessment on mercury’s impact. It said that the assessment from Trump’s EPA was not all-encompassing and did not take into consideration prior board recommendations. The report was logged before the agency announced the final rule. The board said it was a departure from the norm for the EPA to ""categorically"" exclude co-benefits. The move went against both the EPA’s guidance on economic analysis and recommendations of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.  The EPA reviewed links between methylmercury and brain damage, but the board said the agency should do a new risk assessment that also accounted for mercury’s impact on cardiovascular health. The EPA’s assessment on exposure to methylmercury excluded commercial fish — such as fish purchased at restaurants or supermarkets, even though it accounts for 90% of the fish consumed by Americans, the report said. ""For this or any future regulation, the EPA should prepare a new exposure estimate that accounts for total exposure,"" the report said. Michael Honeycutt, chair of the EPA’s Science Advisory Board, said the board did have concerns with how the EPA did its analysis, but it’s difficult to definitively confirm whether the EPA's new rule would lead to serious health problems, death and billions of dollars of expense. ""The EPA would need to re-do a risk assessment and take into account our recommendations,"" said Honeycutt, who also is director of the Toxicology Division of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Other experts said Pelosi was right to infer that the EPA’s change would be detrimental to public health and cost billions annually. ""The report does not use those precise words, but it is reasonable to infer that the SAB believes that the new rule is ill advised,"" said Patrick Parenteau, a law professor and senior counsel in the Environmental and Natural Resources Law Clinic at Vermont Law School. He said it was also reasonable to infer that the rule would increase the risk of diseases and that the total benefits of reducing pollutants would ""more than offset the costs of pollution controls."" The practical effect of the new procedure is unclear, he said, because it likely will be challenged in court or a new administration may repeal it. Pelosi said, ""Even President Trump’s own EPA has admitted that this rule (on air pollutants) threatens to cause serious health problems including brain damage and death and to inflict billions of dollars of economic damage on our struggling economy."" Trump did not overrule his own EPA, the agency rather did not adhere to recommendations from a science advisory board. The advisory board told the EPA it had concerns with how the agency did a risk assessment and said it should do a new one. The chair of the advisory board said that in the absence of a new assessment, it was difficult to say definitively whether the rule would have the impact Pelosi said. Other experts say that while the report did not outright say what Pelosi stated, it was accurate to infer that the rule changes could pose serious health risks for Americans",Half True,"April 23, 2020"

Says Nancy Pelosi’s coronavirus bill includes “tax credits for solar and wind energy … retirement plans for community newspaper employees … $300 million for PBS … climate change studies” and more.,"As President Donald Trump’s negotiators were working with congressional leaders to assemble a coronavirus economic relief package, the president’s re-election campaign didn’t shy away from blasting one key Democratic leader, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. On March 24, Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale shared a video focused on the coronavirus bill Pelosi had released the day before. It named a half-dozen provisions in the Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act that the Trump campaign considered outside the scope of the current crisis. On screen, the ad says: ""Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats clog their coronavirus relief bill with leftist wishlist. Democrat bill includes: tax credits for solar and wind energy … emissions standards and carbon offset requirements for airlines … policing racial makeup of corporate boards … retirement plans for community newspaper employees … $300 million for PBS … climate change studies for civil aviation and aerospace industries. Democrats don’t care about your health or the economy. They only care about politics"" Democratic officials acknowledge that most of those provisions are in the bill, which at the time the ad was launched was taking a back seat to negotiations over a Senate bill. However, one of the provisions cited by the Trump campaign’s ad is not in the bill. A still from a Trump campaign ad targeting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's coronavirus relief bill. Pelosi’s bill seeks to shape the behavior of any airlines that accept federal assistance to the benefit of their workers, customers and the environment. Carbon offsets are addressed in section 704 of the bill. Corporate board diversity, in the form of retrospective reporting requirements, is part of section 407, while the climate change study is in section 707. A statement provided by the Democratic leadership said that ""the extreme impacts that COVID-19 has had on corporate operations, the workforce, the lack of adequate contingency plans designed to protect worker interests and needs, and the impact this has had on the national economy highlights the need to have worker interests represented on corporate boards."" This language, in section 404, is largely drawn from H.R. 1916, a bill that has been introduced but not advanced. The bill would change rules for community newspapers’ defined-benefit pension plans. The Democratic leadership says this is part of an overall pension package to help cash flow for companies. This would be a supplemental appropriation for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds PBS and which is facing shortfalls due to the coronavirus, the Democratic leadership says. This is the one provision cited by the ad that is not actually in the House bill, despite pressure from the industry to include it. The campaign ad says that Pelosi’s coronavirus bill included provisions on ""tax credits for solar and wind energy … emissions standards and carbon offset requirements for airlines … policing racial makeup of corporate boards … retirement plans for community newspaper employees … $300 million for PBS … climate change studies for civil aviation and aerospace industries.""

Says Joe Biden “just announced on CNN he will completely shut down drilling for oil and natural gas on day one of his administration.”,"In what was likely the first-ever presidential debate that observed social distancing, in light of the coronavirus crisis, did Joe Biden go extreme? ""America you better pay attention to what's being said!"" warned a post on Facebook on March 15, 2020, the same night of the Democratic debate on CNN.  ""Joe Biden just announced on CNN he will completely shut down drilling for oil and natural gas on day one of his administration."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In the one-on-one debate, Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders used the term ""day one"" seven times, according to a transcript.  Biden, however, did not use it once.  Biden was speaking quickly during the debate and his words were not as precise as they have been at other times. But when we reached out to his campaign, a spokesperson clarified Biden’s intent.   Here’s exactly what Biden said on oil drilling: ""Number one, no more subsidies for fossil fuel industry. No more drilling on federal lands. No more drilling, including offshore. No ability for the oil industry to continue to drill, period, ends, number one."" Taken literally, the former vice president’s debate comments could be read to mean that he would end oil drilling. Or it could mean that he would not allow any new drilling, which is how the Biden campaign described the candidate’s position.   Biden’s campaign pointed us to the policy on Biden’s campaign website of ""banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters."" It says nothing about drilling on private land. On fracking, the process of blasting pressurized water, sand and chemicals into shale rock miles underground to extract natural gas, Biden said: ""No more — no new fracking."" Moments later, he repeated ""no more drilling on federal lands."" A Biden campaign spokesman clarified afterward that Biden wouldn’t ban fracking — he was referring only to his stated policy to ban new permits for oil and gas drilling on federal land and offshore, the Wall Street Journal reported. A Facebook post says Biden ""just announced on CNN he will completely shut down drilling for oil and natural gas on day one of his administration."" In a CNN debate, Biden said ""no more drilling"" for oil. Taken literally, that could be interpreted to mean he supports ending oil drilling. But he did not use the words ""shut down"" and his stated position has been to ban new oil drilling on federal lands and water, not end ongoing work. Biden was more clear in his debate statements regarding natural gas, saying he would not allow any new fracking.  He did not say he would take either step on day one as president",Mostly False,"March 20, 2020"
“Sen. Bernie Sanders led the effort to dump Vermont's nuclear waste on a poor Latino community in Texas.”,"A new video ad from a dark-money group reprises a years-old attack on Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., about one attempt to dispose of his state’s nuclear waste. The 15-second ad, which is being shared on Facebook, opens with a silent clip of Sanders speaking. A female narrator and words on the screen make this claim against the Democratic presidential candidate: ""Sen. Bernie Sanders led the effort to dump Vermont's nuclear waste on a poor Latino community in Texas."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim accurately describes Sanders’ role in leading the legislative effort. But it gives the false impression that the waste was dumped in the community. The ad is from United We Succeed, whose website describes its opposition to Sanders and contains more details about the claim we’re checking. United We Succeed calls itself a partner of the Big Tent Project Fund, which Politico described as a Democratic dark-money group aimed at boosting moderates and bashing Sanders. Dark-money groups are political nonprofits that don’t have to disclose their donors. United We Succeed did not respond to our requests for information. We reported on a similar claim during Sanders’ 2016 run for the Democratic nomination, finding: In 1998, the House approved a compact struck between Texas, Vermont and Maine that would allow Vermont and Maine to dump low-level nuclear waste in Texas. Sanders co-sponsored the bill and actively ushered it through Congress. It was widely expected the site would be in Sierra Blanca, a community about 16 miles from the Mexico border. At the time, the community was about two-thirds Latino, and its residents had an average annual income of $8,000, according to an article in the Bangor (Maine) Daily News. The low-level nuclear waste was to include ""items such as scrap metal and worker’s gloves … as well as medical gloves used in radiation treatments at hospitals,"" according to the Bangor Daily News.  Sanders’ campaign pointed out that Sierra Blanca was not specified as the site in the federal legislation, and that the legislation had overwhelming support of the legislatures, governors and voters in Texas, Maine and Vermont.  But it’s clear Sanders did help lead legislation that won approval in Congress. In reviewing the issue in 2016, when it was raised during Sanders’ first presidential run, Texas Monthly concluded that ""it’s fair to characterize Sanders’ support for the project as driven largely by a desire to see a Vermont problem resolved far from his own backyard."" Authorities in Texas ultimately rejected Sierra Blanca as the site because of safety concerns over its proximity to a geologic fault line. No nuclear waste was dumped there. In 2012, a site in Andrews County in West Texas, about 200 miles from Sierra Blanca, opened to accept the Vermont waste.  
A Facebook ad said, ""Sen. Bernie Sanders led the effort to dump Vermont's nuclear waste on a poor Latino community in Texas."" Sanders supported legislation that allowed for the dumping of nuclear waste from Vermont in Texas; the exact site wasn’t specified in the legislation, but it was widely expected to be Sierra Blanca, a low-income, largely Latino community.  But the post leaves the impression that dumping was done there, when it wasn’t",Half True,"March 13, 2020"
"On key issues including taxes, health care, the Green New Deal, abortion, and guns, there is “no daylight between” Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden.","The Republican National Committee didn’t waste much time after the Democratic presidential race narrowed to two main candidates to paint Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders with the same brush.  A mass email sent by the RNC on March 5 began with the subject line, ""Biden and Bernie, two sides of the same coin."" It offered about a dozen policy issues where — according to the email at least — the two Democrats had identical stances. The issues include taxes, health care, the Green New Deal, federal abortion funding, the death penalty, and guns. ""It’s official, the Democrat Party is now deciding which near octogenarian career politician will be their nominee,"" the email said. ""And those aren’t the only similarities between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. … There is no so-called ‘moderate’ option for Democrats. Just radicalism."" We decided to take a closer look at the email, issue by issue. Here’s what we found. Claim: ""Biden: The ‘the first thing I would do’ is raise middle class taxes. Bernie says he will raise taxes on anyone making over $29,000."" One of Sanders’ options for paying for his Medicare for All proposal is to add an additional 4 percentage points to existing income tax rates for those who earn more than $29,000. So while this is not a guarantee, it is one option Sanders has suggested. Biden hasn’t proposed anything like this. In fact, his tax plan would increase the top marginal rate from 37% to 39.6%, affecting those who earn more than $400,000 — not exactly a middle-class income level. Other aspects of Biden’s tax plan target provisions of special interest to higher-income individuals and corporations, such as capital gains taxes, corporate tax rates, and additional payroll taxes for high earners. *** Claim: ""Biden supports government health care for illegal immigrants. Bernie supports government health care for illegal immigrants."" When we asked the RNC about the assertion about Biden, they pointed to a June 2019 debate in which NBC’s Savannah Guthrie asked all candidates to raise their hand ""if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants."" Biden and Sanders, among others, raised their hands. However, this glosses over some nuances in their positions. Sanders would provide coverage to undocumented immigrants under his single-payer insurance plan; he has tweeted, ""If you are a human being, regardless of your immigration status, you have a right to health care.""  Biden would not go quite that far. Under Biden’s proposal, undocumented immigrants would be able to buy insurance from the Affordable Care Act marketplaces — from which they are currently barred — but would not be able to receive federal subsidies that make these plans affordable.  If undocumented immigrants bought plans without subsidies, they wouldn’t be receiving government health care, as the email claims — they would be signing up for private insurance plans in the marketplace. *** Claim: ""Biden supports a government takeover of health care. Not only does Biden’s plan not allow Americans to keep their private health insurance, it guarantees ‘massive disruptions to private coverage.’ Bernie supports a government takeover of health care. Bernie’s health care agenda eliminates private health insurance."" Sanders would create a single-payer system in which the government acts as the health insurer for everyone, effectively supplanting most private insurance. This plan would ""provide everyone in America with comprehensive health care coverage, free at the point of service,"" Sanders’ campaign website says.  Biden offers a more modest alternative, in which individuals could voluntarily buy in to the federal Medicare program for their insurance. Under Biden’s proposal, private insurance would remain part of the health insurance market. ""Instead of starting from scratch and getting rid of private insurance, he has a plan to build on the Affordable Care Act by giving Americans more choice, reducing health care costs, and making our health care system less complex to navigate,"" Biden’s campaign website says. *** Claim: ""Biden supports free college. Bernie supports free college."" This is substantially misleading. Sanders would ""guarantee tuition and debt-free public colleges, universities,"" trade schools, and historically black colleges. Biden’s proposals apply only to community colleges. Biden would provide ""two years of community college or other high-quality training program without debt for any hard-working individual."" Claim: ""Biden supports reparations. Bernie supports reparations."" Biden and Sanders have both said they support an official process to study the question of whether the descendants of slaves should receive reparations, but it’s too strong a statement to say they support the idea. As recently as 2019, Sanders was dismissive of reparations, but he later announced his support for a bill that would establish a commission to study the issue. Biden, meanwhile, told the Washington Post that his administration would ""study how reparations may be part of"" efforts to curb racism ""and ensure the voices of descendants are central when gathering data and information."" The Biden campaign also told Vice that he thinks the U.S. should ""gather the data necessary to have an informed conversation about reparations."" *** Claim: ""Biden promised to end illegal immigration detention ‘across the board,’ and to not deport illegal immigrants who have committed felony-like offenses in other countries. Bernie backs a moratorium on all deportations of illegal immigrants in U.S. and says that it is not ‘appropriate’ to deport illegal immigrants not following law in the U.S."" This is largely accurate. The email cites a comment by Biden at a Vice News event when he was asked, ""How exactly would you detain immigrants?"" He said, ""I would not retain them behind bars … They show up, and you have an ankle bracelet (and) you set a hearing. We have to surge to the border, to the areas where people are being held. Get rid of all the cages, everybody out of prisons. The most you put on is an ankle bracelet, and you give a date when you show up for an immigration hearing, and you show up."" Asked whether that was for adults and children, Biden said, ""across the board."" The email also cited a separate town hall comment by Biden in which he promised that in his first 100 days in office, deportations would only be carried out for felonies committed in the United States. Sanders, for his part, says on his website that he would ""dismantle"" deportation programs and detention centers and ""institute a moratorium on deportations until a thorough audit of past practices and policies is complete."" *** Claim: ""Biden supports the Green New Deal, ""radical decarbonization,"" and eliminating fossil fuels even if that means sacrificing hundreds of thousands of blue-collar jobs. Bernie supports the Green New Deal, eliminating fossil fuels, and is okay with sacrificing American jobs for his climate agenda."" Sanders is a proud supporter of the Green New Deal — he is a leading co-sponsor of the Senate version of the resolution, which is an aspirational document that sets goals for combating climate change through reductions in carbon emissions, increased energy efficiency, and expansions of clean-energy infrastructure. Biden isn’t as vocal a supporter of the legislation specifically, but he has name-checked the plan on his campaign website and echoed some of its language in his climate change policy. ""Biden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face,"" Biden’s campaign website says. ""It powerfully captures two basic truths, which are at the core of his plan: (1) the United States urgently needs to embrace greater ambition on an epic scale to meet the scope of this challenge, and (2) our environment and our economy are completely and totally connected."" Among other things, Biden seeks to achieve a ""100% clean energy economy"" later than 2050.  The email is also correct that Biden responded affirmatively to a question in a Democratic debate that he’s OK with thousands or even hundreds of thousands of job losses in carbon-based energies as part of the transition to renewable energy. *** Claim: ""Biden supports federal funds for abortions after repealing the Hyde Amendment. Bernie supports federal funding for abortions as well as the repealing of the Hyde Amendment."" Repealing the decades-old Hyde Amendment — which bars the use of federal funds for abortions — is a goal Biden and Sanders share. Biden is a relatively recent convert to this position. After sustaining attacks from other Democratic presidential candidates, including Sanders, Biden announced in June 2019 that he would be seeking an end to the restriction. *** Claim: ""Biden supports an end to the death penalty. Bernie wants to end the death penalty."" This is another issue both candidates agree on. Biden’s campaign website says that he would ""eliminate the death penalty"" by ending it at the federal level and encourage states to do the same. Death row inmates would instead serve life sentences without parole. *** Claim: ""Biden supports a federal ‘assault weapon’ ban. Bernie supports a federal ‘assault weapon’ ban."" The two candidates agree on this as well. Biden’s website says he supports a ban on the manufacture and sale of assault weapons. He would also seek to tighten regulation of existing assault weapons and pursue buybacks. Sanders’ proposals are essentially identical: Banning the sale and distribution of assault weapons, tightening regulations and implementing a buyback program. The Republican National Committee said in a mass email that on about a dozen issues, there is ""no daylight between"" Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. The email accurately portrays the candidates’ similarities on roughly half of the issues cited, including their positions on federal abortion funding, ending the death penalty, banning assault weapons, and the Green New Deal. However, the email is incorrect on a similar number of other issues, including taxes, health care, free college tuition, and reparations for slavery",Half True,"March 10, 2020"
"Says Bernie Sanders would “go beyond reform and reorder the economy in ways most Democrats — let alone most Americans — don’t support.""","In his speech after the Nevada caucuses, Pete Buttigieg took a shot at his rival Bernie Sanders, who had just won a clear victory. ""Sen. Sanders sees capitalism as the root of all evil,"" Buttigieg said. ""He’d go beyond reform and reorder the economy in ways most Democrats — let alone most Americans — don’t support."" Buttigieg is wrong to say most Democrats don’t support Sanders’ agenda. Polling shows that key elements of Sanders’ economic platform are strongly popular among Democrats. And several of them score majority support among all voters. However, support among all voters for some of Sanders’ proposals declines when poll respondents are told about the costs. And in some cases, less-aggressive policy options — some of them backed by Sanders’ competitors — receive wider support from voters than his proposals do. We looked at several elements of Sanders’ platform that could potentially have an impact on the economy. They include instituting single-payer health care; the Green New Deal to combat climate change; tuition-free college; student debt forgiveness; a $15 minimum wage; breaking up big banks, and paid family leave. We found broad acceptance among economists that at least some of these policies would qualify as ""reordering"" the economy.  By shifting payments from private insurers to the federal government, single-payer health care would dramatically change the health care sector, which accounts for 17.7% of the nation’s gross domestic product.  This policy, and breaking up big banks, ""would change things in a major way,"" said Stanford University economist Roger Noll. ""These are huge sectors.""   The Green New Deal would affect a smaller, but still substantial, share of the economy that relates to energy, by setting aggressive targets for phasing out fossil fuels. The proposal also includes a federal job guarantee. Economists’ views vary on the scale of the other proposals, but some said that changes to the higher-education sector — making college tuition free and forgiving student loan debt — could have a significant impact on the economy. And while the impact of other aspects of Sanders’ plan, such as a $15 minimum wage or paid family leave, might be less dramatic, they could have significant effects on certain regions and employment sectors. ""It's quite fair to say he is reordering the economy, given the massive transfer of money from the private sector to the government,"" said Daniel Mitchell, a pro-free market economist. We collected recent poll results on most of these proposals and put them into the chart below. The questions in these polls did not identify the ideas as being backed by Sanders, and they offered basic descriptions of the plans, without mentioning complications, such as the cost involved.  The data shows that — contrary to what Buttigieg said — a large share of Democrats support Sanders’ economic proposals, according to polls. Among Democrats, single-payer health care receives upwards of 58% support, the Green New Deal gets 86%, a $15 minimum wage gets 84%, tuition-free college gets 76%, student-loan forgiveness gets 79%, breaking up big banks gets 60%, and paid family leave gets 94%.   Among all Americans, only one of these policies — single-payer health care — gets less than 50% support. Paid family leave got 84% support, while the other policies had support levels in the 53% to 63% range among all voters. That said, other poll results give Buttigieg’s remark some support. First, when we inquired about his comment, the Buttigieg camp pointed to health insurance. As it turns out, Buttigieg’s own policy preference — a public option to buy into Medicare for those who want it — wins majority support from all Americans, a level of support significantly stronger than the 30% to 40% national approval rates for a Sanders-style single-payer system. In February 2020, the Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll found that 44% of voters preferred a public option, compared to 26% of voters who preferred single-payer and 23% who opposed both. Democrats alone also expressed a preference for the public option, with 51% favoring the public option compared to 39% for single-payer. Second, providing poll respondents with more complete descriptions of a policy option — often including the cost required — usually reduced the levels of support. Here are some examples: • $15 minimum wage. A SurveyMonkey poll conducted for Business Insider asked two questions about the $15 minimum wage. The first was, ""Do you support or oppose increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour?"" This question elicited 63% support among all respondents. The second question added that the Congressional Budget Office — the non-partisan number-crunching arm of Congress — found that a $15 minimum wage would increase wages for 27 million workers and lift 1.3 million households out of poverty, but could also eliminate 1.3 million jobs. Adding this caveat dropped support levels to just 37%. • Student loan forgiveness. A Quinnipiac University poll in April 2019 asked two questions about a plan for student loan forgiveness. First, the pollsters asked, ""Do you support or oppose the federal government forgiving up to $50,000 in student loans for individuals who live in households that make less than $250,000 a year?"" This won support from 57% of all Americans, and 79% of Democrats. Then they asked, ""Would you support or oppose this plan to forgive student loans if it was paid for by a new tax on wealthy individuals?"" On this question, Democratic support remained strong — 72% — but reaction among respondents overall turned negative, with 44% support and 52% opposition. • Paid family leave. A survey sponsored by the libertarian Cato Institute showed strong initial support — 74% among all respondents — for a paid family leave program granting 12 weeks for birth, adoption, or medical need. But support dropped significantly when possible impacts were mentioned. The poll found that only 48% would still support the policy if it cost another $450 a year in taxes. • Green New Deal. A Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll in July and August 2019 found broad support for individual elements of the Green New Deal, which Sanders backs. These include a jobs guarantee (78%), energy efficiency improvements for existing buildings (70%), a goal of 100 percent of U.S. power coming from emissions-free sources within 10 years (69%), increased federal spending on disaster-prevention infrastructure (67%), new regulations on businesses (61%), and reductions in coal mining jobs (55%). The one unpopular aspect of the plan? Increasing spending by trillions of dollars, which was backed by just 30% of respondents. Buttigieg said that Sanders would ""go beyond reform and reorder the economy in ways most Democrats — let alone most Americans — don’t support."" In reality, polling consistently shows that most Democrats do approve of key parts of Sanders’ economic agenda, including single-payer health care, the Green New Deal, tuition-free college, student debt forgiveness, a $15 minimum wage, breaking up big banks, and paid family leave. And for each of those issues except single-payer health care, a more modest percentage of all Americans — but still a majority — signal their support. It’s important to note, however, that support levels by all Americans drop significantly once voters are informed about the policies’ costs, often to majority disapproval. And on health care policy, Buttigieg’s plan — the public option to buy into Medicare — is more popular than Sanders’ single-payer proposal is, both among all voters and among Democrats",Mostly False,"February 25, 2020"
“America’s carbon emissions are being reduced at a rate far higher than any country in the world.”,"House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, recently accused the newly-elected Democratic majorities in the General Assembly of undermining Virginia’s pro-business environment. In a blunt Feb. 12 floor speech, Gilbert criticized Democrats for advancing bills that would raise Virginia’s minimum wage, increase the gas tax to aid transportation, and impose a five-cent state fee on each disposable bag stores provide to consumers.  Gilbert particularly focused on bills passed by the House and Senate that would require Virginia to completely rely on renewable energy sources by mid-century - a death knell for Southwest Virginia’s declining coal industry. ""Democrats apparently want to run Virginia’s thriving economy, not on the abundant energy resources that we already have at our disposal here in this country and this Commonwealth, but merely on rays of sunlight and gusts of wind,"" he said. ""They are unyielding in this pursuit of their agenda, even though America’s carbon emissions are being reduced at a rate far higher than any country in the world while we are presiding over one of the largest energy booms in world history."" We fact-checked Gilbert’s assertion that ""America’s carbon emissions are being reduced at a rate higher than any country in the world."" We asked Garren Shipley, Gilbert’s communications director, for the source of the minority leader’s claim. He sent us a report on global carbon emissions in 2019, published Feb. 11, 2020 by the International Energy Agency - a 30-nation organization that researches and makes policy recommendations for sustainable energy sources. The report said carbon emissions declined in the U.S. last year and held steady across the world. The language in the report can be a bit confusing. ""The United States saw the largest decline in energy-related CO2 emissions in 2019 on a country basis – a fall of 140 Mt, or 2.9%, to 4.8 Gt.""  Thoroughly read, the reports says U.S. led all nations in reducing its tonnage of carbon pollution last year. But contrary to Gilbert’s statement, other countries cut their emissions by larger rates. Let’s explore this distinction. Tonnage The IEA found that the U.S, carbon emissions fell from 4.94 billion metric tons in 2018 to 4.8 billion last year. That’s a reduction of 140 million metric tons  - the most in the world, according to IEA. The report attributed the drop to a 15% decline in the use of coal-fired energy, largely caused by competition from cheaper, cleaner natural gas. Also, mild summer and winter weather eased demand for air-conditioning and heating. The IEA won’t publish carbon data for every nation until March. But here are the few comparison numbers that can be gleaned from the February report: Germany reduced its carbon emissions from about 674 million metric tons in 2018 to 620 million last year, its lowest level since the 1950s. The 54-million-ton drop led European Union nations. Japan cut its emissions from about 1,076 million cubic tons in 2018 to 1,030 million last year - a drop of 46 million cubic tons.  The drop in the U.S. was encouraging to some environmentalists because it reversed an increase in carbon emissions in 2018. But the one-year measurement starting in 2018 produces a myopic result. That’s because carbon emissions in 2018 soared to a four-year high, erasing progress that had been made in 2017.  If you measure from 2017 to 2019, U.S. carbon emissions increased by 39 metric million tons, and fell in Germany and Japan, according to IEA data. If you measure from 2016 to 2019, U.S. emissions declined by 38 million tons - about one-third as much as they fell in Germany and Japan. If you start in 2010, U.S. emissions dropped by 452 million tons - far outpacing Germany and Japan. In other words, the data can show different trends. ""A lot of it depends on where your baseline is,"" said Jamie Russell, director of the Appalachian Energy Center at Appalachian State University.  The U.S. and China are by far the world's largest carbon polluters. China is responsible for 28% of emission tonnage; the U.S. for 15%. Chinese pollution is increasing.  It’s also increasing in the third-place country, India, which spews 7% of the world’s carbon tonnage. No other country is above 4.6%. Although many European nations have cut emissions, none of those countries discharge more than 2 percent of the global tonnage. Think of a group of people that have all decided to lose weight. If one person weighs several times more than that the others, he’s likely to lose the most pounds. But that doesn’t mean he’s the most effective dieter. Rate  That heaviest person may not be losing weight at the highest ""rate"" - the term Gilbert used when talking about U.S. emission cuts. A 500-pound person dropping 50 pounds in a year lost weight at a 10% annual rate. But a 150-pound person who shed only 20 pounds during that period lost weight at a faster 13% annual rate. The same principle applies to measuring rates of U.S. carbon reduction. The U.S. cut emissions by 2.9% in 2019, according to the IEA. That’s not the highest rate. European Union nations cut emissions by 5%, with Germany leading the way at 8%. Japan reduced emissions by 4.3%. The February report doesn’t offer this datum for other countries. From 2007 to 2017, U.S. lowered carbon emissions by an average 1.5% a year, according to BP. Nine European countries cut their emissions at a higher rate: the Czech Republic, Finland, Greece, Italy, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine and the United Kingdom. The IEA report describes the U.S. progress last year in terms of reduced tonnage. But it does not say the U.S. cut carbon emissions at the world’s fastest rate, nor do two articles on the report that Shipley sent us to back Gilbert’s claim. ""It was the largest drop in terms of tons, but that is not a ‘rate,’"" we were told by John Reilly, co-director of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change at the MIT Sloan School of Management. ""Your percentage calculation is a ‘rate.’  Since the U.S. is among one of the biggest emitters among countries, much smaller drops for other countries translate to larger rates of reduction."" Robert Brecha, a professor in the department of physics and the renewable and clean energy program at the University of Dayton, agreed. ""Since the US is the second largest emitter, the magnitude of reductions is important,"" he wrote. ""But it is certainly not true that  ‘America's carbon emissions are being reduced at a rate far higher than any other country in the world.’"" Our ruling Gilbert misstated the findings of an IEA report when he said, ""America’s carbon emissions are being reduced at a rate far higher than any country in the world."" The report requires close reading. It found that in 2019, the U.S. cut carbon emissions by 140 million metric tons, the highest weight loss in the world. That’s significant because the U.S. is the world’s second-largest carbon polluter.   But the IEA did not say the U.S. is cutting emission higher rate than any nation, let alone a ""far-higher"" rate that Gilbert described.

Jan Schakowsky questioned the White House’s acting budget director on major cuts Trump’s plan would make to the Environmental Protection Agency. ""Does this budget propose cutting funding for the Environmental Protection Agency?"" Schakowsky, an Evanston Democrat, asked Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget Russell Vought. ""It proposes a cut to EPA by about 26% and we believe that we will still be able to fulfill the statutory responsibilities of clean air, clean water, clean —"" Vought said, before Schakowsky interjected with a claim that caught our attention: ""We’ve also seen in the time that he’s been president, an increase in carbon emissions going absolutely in the wrong way,"" she said. In 2018, PolitiFact rated Half True a claim from Trump’s EPA that greenhouse emissions were down under the president, finding that while emissions were continuing to fall, the rate of decline had slowed during Trump’s first year in office. The data at that time did not show emissions were rising. So we wanted to find out whether more recent figures support Schakowsky’s claim that emissions have increased under Trump, and whether the changes suggest a trend going ""in the wrong way."" Overall, emissions are indeed up from 2016 levels following a spike in 2018. After that, carbon emissions again began to decline. Experts interviewed say those incremental changes may have nothing to do with Trump policies. In response to our inquiry, a spokesman for Schakowsky’s office pointed to reports highlighting a 2018 spike in U.S. carbon dioxide emissions following three years of declines. A report published in May 2019 by the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm, estimated CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion rose 2.7% in 2018. It was the second-largest annual increase since 2000, the group reported, though somewhat smaller than an estimate it made earlier in the year based on preliminary data. The largest increase occurred in 2010 under then-President Barack Obama as the economy began its rebound from the recession, according to the group. In a draft report released this month, the EPA noted a similar uptick in 2018 CO2 emissions, which comprise the vast majority of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So Schakowsky is correct there was a spike in carbon emissions on Trump’s watch. In 2019, however, U.S. carbon dioxide emissions fell again, according to several recent international reports. And that drop was not a surprise. Indeed, the preliminary Rhodium report for 2018 noted that while the pace of U.S. emissions decline had slowed since 2016, the group did not ""expect a repeat"" increase the following year. To address that point, Schakowsky’s office sent us a Scientific American article speculating the decline identified in one of the international reports could be ""overly optimistic"" and a Washington Post story highlighting the Rhodium Group’s lukewarm preliminary findings for U.S. emissions in 2019. While a significant decline in coal consumption last year helped drive the overall drop, Rhodium noted, the United States made little progress in other areas. By their accounting, net greenhouse gas emissions remained slightly higher in 2019 than at the end of 2016. ""There are low-cost technology solutions to reduce oil and gas methane emissions,"" the Rhodium report said. ""But their deployment at scale requires strengthening regulations that the Trump Administration instead has been weakening."" It’s also worth noting Rhodium did not attribute any of the emissions changes seen so far to the Trump administration, which has made eliminating federal environmental regulations a priority. Instead, both Rhodium and the federal government pegged the 2018 increase to fluctuations in weather, which drove up heating and cooling needs, and to increased economic growth. ""Overall there has indeed been an increase (or at best little or no change) in carbon emissions since Trump has been president,"" said John Nielsen-Gammon, a climatologist at Texas A&M University, in an email response. ""Whether Trump’s policies have had any significant positive or negative effect on U.S. carbon emissions is a separate question."" Schakowsky said that in the time Trump has been president, the nation has seen ""an increase in carbon emissions going absolutely in the wrong way."" Reports show U.S. carbon dioxide emissions did spike on Trump’s watch in 2018. They fell again last year, but greenhouse gas emissions overall remain higher than they were before he took office",Mostly True,"February 16, 2020"
"“Over the past two years, climate and weather disaster damage has cost the U.S. over $400 billion.”","When it comes to weather and climate change, there has been lots of talk about causes and consequences. In some areas of Wisconsin this winter, rapidly melting snow has overtaken roads and caused sewage to overflow, while flooding and its effects continue to be a concern. The National Weather Service in Green Bay indicated most rivers in northeastern Wisconsin have more than a 50% chance of flooding to some extent. Whether it be the toll on infrastructure or disrupting business operations, weather and climate change carries a monetary cost. On Dec. 10, 2019, the U.S. Senate Democrats’ Climate Committee sent out a tweet arguing Wisconsin roads and bridges are at risk of collapse from severe storms and flooding. That same day, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., tweeted this about the national cost: ""Over the past two years, climate and weather disaster damage has cost the U.S. over $400 billion and our economy will lose over $500 billion annually from lost labor, crop failure and damages related to extreme weather if we don’t #ActOnClimate now."" Is Baldwin right about $400 billion-plus in damages? The source When asked for backup for the claim, Baldwin’s staff pointed to The Fourth National Climate Assessment, a 1,526-page document that examines the effects, risks and course of climate change in the United States.  The Fourth National Climate Assessment is a cooperative effort between experts from academia and government agencies, such as the U.S. Department of Energy, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Department of the Interior.  On page 66, the report indicates NOAA estimates the United States incurred $400 billion in damages from weather and climate disasters from 2015 through April 6, 2018.  But that figure is for different years and a longer time period (three-plus years) than Baldwin claimed. NOAA climatologist Adam Smith from the Center for Weather and Climate at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information in Asheville, N.C., noted the numbers in the report are also a bit dated. He pointed us to newer figures. Baldwin’s reference was to the ""past two years."" She made the statement in December 2019, so examining the two-year span immediately before that, her numbers are dramatically off. NOAA estimates the U.S. experienced $137.8 billion of economic damage from 2018 and 2019 when adjusted for the consumer price index, and $135.6 billion unadjusted.  However, looking at the two most recent full years before Baldwin’s claim — 2017 and 2018 — Baldwin’s figures line up. NOAA estimates the inflation-adjusted damage in those calendar years was $411.7 billion. The NOAA calculation includes damage to buildings and public infrastructure, among other costs. The agency tracks damage from drought, flooding, freeze, severe storms, tropical cyclones, wildfires and winter storms. Smith said in an email NOAA uses data from agencies such as the National Weather Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the National Interagency Fire Center. There are some types of data they do not include due to inconsistencies. ""For example, our disaster cost estimates are actually somewhat conservative, as we don’t account for losses/damages to natural capital assets, mental and physical healthcare-related costs post-disaster, or incorporate all downstream economic impacts,"" Smith wrote. We checked with several experts from academia who agreed that the NOAA numbers are probably the best available for the United States. The agency’s data shows that the number of disasters that topped $1 billion in damages has increased each decade since the 1980s.  There were 119 weather and climate disasters that topped that threshold during the 2010s, up from 59 in the 2000s, even after adjusting for inflation. Over the past three years (2017 through 2019), there was an average of nearly 15 disasters that topped $1 billion in damages.  Our ruling Baldwin said ""Over the past two years, climate and weather disaster damage has cost the U.S. over $400 billion.""

"""The Machinists Union does not (support the USMCA trade deal). And every environmental organization in this country (also) opposes it.""","In the last debate before the Feb. 3 Iowa presidential precinct caucuses, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said the United-States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement (USMCA) did not go far enough to protect the environment or the rights of workers.  Moderator: ""But, Sen. Sanders, to be clear, the AFL-CIO supports this deal [the USMCA]. Are you unwilling to compromise?"" Sanders: ""The AFL-CIO does. ""The Machinists Union does not (support the USMCA trade deal). And every environmental organization in this country, including the Sunrise Organization, who are supporting my candidacy, opposes it."" We found Sanders mostly correct in stating major organizations oppose the USMC, although stating that every major organization opposes it was a stretch. Plus, his claims about union support for the deal need some context. Responding to PolitiFact, the Sanders campaign pointed to a letter from a group of 10 high-profile environmental organizations, including the Sierra Club, the League of Conservation Voters, Greenpeace, and others, urging Congress to vote against the USMCA.  The 10 groups signing the letter have a combined 12 million members.  ""We do not get many opportunities to renegotiate trade deals. At this pivotal moment, we cannot afford to lock ourselves into a multi-decade deal that ignores climate change and helps corporate polluters,"" the letter stated. However, some large environmental groups did not take a stance on the USMCA. In an email to The Daily Iowan, representatives from the Environmental Working Group, a nonpartisan conservation nonprofit, said the group has no official stance on the USMCA. Likewise, the Union of Concerned Scientists said the USMCA is not an issue the organization is working on or following.  The USMCA is the new agreement governing trade between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, updating the nearly 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement. The leaders of the three countries involved in the agreement agreed to the USMCA in November 2018.  The USMCA passed the House of Representatives 385-41 on Dec. 19, 2019, and the Senate 89-10 on Jan. 17, 2020, with bipartisan support. Sanders was one of 10 senators to vote no on the agreement. Channing Dutton, a Des Moines-based attorney and member of Citizens Climate Lobby, said most environmental groups would oppose the agreement because the USMCA does not include provisions for climate change in its current form. ""It’s a safe bet that every responsible climate change organization would oppose any trade agreement that ignored the effects of climate change or allow easy modification of the agreement because of climate change impacts,"" Dutton said.  Dutton, who has endorsed businessman Tom Steyer’s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, added that the agreement cannot be modified to adapt to worsening climate conditions, echoing the concerns environmental groups expressed that the deal cannot be altered to provide provisions for climate change after it becomes law.  ""This is why he [Sanders] said he would not sign the deal without climate change considerations,"" Dutton said. ""They use the agreement to stop people, communities, states, and even nations from doing things such as adopting the carbon tax that Citizens Climate Lobby supports."" Sanders also brought up during the Des Moines debate the USMCA’s support among unions. Moderator Brianne Pfannenstiel, the chief politics reporter at the Des Moines Register, said the AFL-CIO, a federation of more than 55 national and international labor unions, supports the deal.  The AFL-CIO announced in December 2019 its support for the deal, which it previously opposed, after negotiating with lawmakers to include more provisions for the deal it deemed to be labor-friendly.  ""The USMCA is far from perfect. It alone is not a solution for outsourcing, inequality or climate change,"" the AFL-CIO said in a prepared statement. ""Successfully tackling these issues requires a full-court press of economic policies that empower workers, including the repeal of tax cuts which reward companies for shipping our jobs overseas."" During the debate, Sanders noted that the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace (IAM) workers, which has a membership of 600,000, opposes the USMCA.  Although the machinist and aerospace union is part of the AFL-CIO, it issued a statement criticizing the USMCA, though it did not cite concerns over climate change.  ""U.S. workers have been waiting over 25 years for a responsible trade deal that puts their interests ahead of corporations who are fleeing our shores,"" the machinists and aerospace union wrote in the statement. ""They are still waiting. The IAM will oppose NAFTA 2.0.""  Responding to PolitiFact, the Sanders campaign cited the IAM statement, as well as statements from the National Family Farm Coalition, which has around 450,000 members, and the United Food and Commercial Workers, with 1.3 million members, as evidence of labor unions upset with the USMCA.  While some unions are in opposition, other large unions have issued statements of support for the newest version of the USMCA. The Teamsters, a union consisting of truck drivers, mechanical workers and other trades with a membership of 1.4 million, supports the deal.  Additionally, the United Steel Workers, with a membership of 860,000, supported the deal, while the United Auto Workers, membership 990,000, did not explicitly support the deal, but said the deal will need to be strictly enforced to prevent the further loss of U.S. auto industry jobs to Mexico.  ""We will do all we can to vigilantly monitor the agreement to try to make sure multinational corporations live up to their end of the bargain, but we should have no illusion that our efforts alone will get the job done,"" United Auto Workers president Rory Gamble wrote in a prepared statement.  Sanders said about supporting USMCA, ""The AFL-CIO does. The Machinists Union does not. Every environmental organization in this country, including the Sunrise Organization, who are supporting my candidacy, opposes it."" Sanders is correct in saying the Machinists Union does not support the USMCA trade deal, although some major unions support it.  Not every single environmental group in the country opposed USMCA — some had no position.

The graphic cites the prestigious Science magazine as the source of the tidbit and tells readers, ""An inconvenient truth that climate change alarmists leave out.""  When we took a closer look, we found that the post is based on real numbers, but it glosses over some context that paints a more nuanced picture. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Young America’s Foundation pointed us to the peer-reviewed article in Science published in 2015. That article summarized the findings of several scientists from the United States and Australia in a table that ranked the 20 biggest contributors of ""mismanaged plastic waste."" ""Mismanaged waste"" refers to material that is either littered or inadequately disposed, and thus could find its way into the oceans due to wind, tides, or rivers because it is dumped in open landfills. On that list, the United States ranked 20th. We used the paper’s data to create the following pie chart, which shows that the United States accounts for about 1% of the world total. A big reason why the United States ranks low as a global contributor of mismanaged plastic waste is that the United States, like other advanced industrialized countries, does a better job of securing its waste than lower-income nations do. (In fact, the United States is the only country on the 20-nation list that’s a high-income country.) So is there anything else to know? One of the paper’s co-authors, industrial ecology professor Roland Geyer of the University of California-Santa Barbara,, offered a few cautions. First, he said the data is already a decade old, and it is based on modeling, not empirical observations. So the ""uncertainties"" about the data ""are large,"" he said. Second, the data addresses how the plastic enters the oceans, not who made the plastic or even who used the plastic. ""A non-negligible portion of the plastic entering the oceans from Chinese soil could be from products originally produced in the U.S. or from plastic waste exported by the U.S. to China,"" Geyer said. Meanwhile, the paper did not address how much plastic was already in the ocean at the time the calculations were made, said George Leonard, the chief scientist at the Ocean Conservancy, an advocacy group. It’s possible that the United States accounted for a larger share of existing plastic waste that migrated to the ocean many years before. ""We estimated the total amount of mismanaged plastic waste generated within 50 kilometers of a coast that could enter the ocean,"" said Kara Lavender Law, a research professor of oceanography with the Sea Education Association in Woods Hole, Mass., and a co-author of the 2015 paper. ""We did not take into account plastic debris entering the ocean from other sources, such as natural disasters or lost or abandoned fishing gear."" The upshot is that we don’t have a great idea of how big a contributor the United States is to ocean plastic pollution. In a Facebook post, Young America’s Foundation said, ""FACT: Less than 1% of the trash in the ocean is from the United States."" This number stems from a peer-reviewed scientific article, but the post’s wording glosses over nuances about the finding. The 1% figure refers to ""mismanaged"" waste entering the ocean in 2010, and does not take into account the accumulated waste already in the ocean prior to that year.  In addition, the study only looked at the country that immediately held the waste before it entered the ocean. It’s possible that the United States generated an additional volume of plastic waste that ended up in another country before going into the ocean",Half True,"January 15, 2020"

The group has board members from such environmental groups as Clean Energy Action, Greenpeace, and the Rainforest Action Network. The Global Coal Plant Tracker includes all coal-fired units 30 megawatts or larger. The tracker’s July 29 list of coal fired power stations by country counts 2,459 plants in operation, 256 under construction and 359 planned for construction. That adds up to a total of 3,074, far less than the 5,615 in the Facebook post. For the United States, the tracker shows that there are 296 in operation (nearly 20 times more than what this Facebook post claims) with none under construction. In China, there are 1,032 in operation (less than half of what the post claims), 126 under construction and 76 planned for construction. Generally, the best way to compare capacity is by megawatts, said Anna Mikulska, a fellow for the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University. The global tracker’s data shows China at the highest capacity (987,364) followed by the United States (254,332) and then India (225,638). While we found no evidence to back up the numbers in the Facebook post, it is worth noting that the growth of coal isn’t in the United States.  ""It is true that whatever coal the world is going to add, is going to be mostly in the developing world, India and China as well as Southeast Asia,"" Mikulska said. ""Thus, there is a point to be made that that's where we need to look into to try to act upon climate goals.""

"Says the Potomac River ""has gotten dirtier and dirtier and dirtier and dirtier. I go down there and that litter is left almost exclusively by immigrants.""","Fox News host Tucker Carlson ripped into immigrants in the nation’s capital, accusing them without evidence of contaminating the Potomac River. In an interview with the Atlantic, Carlson said he’s been fishing in the river, which stretches from West Virginia into the Chesapeake Bay, for almost 35 years. ""It has gotten dirtier and dirtier and dirtier and dirtier,"" he said. ""I go down there, and that litter is left almost exclusively by immigrants."" Asked how he knew immigrants were to blame, Carlson added: ""Because I’m there. I watch it."" We found that Carlson’s claim is at odds with data collected by activists devoted to keeping the Potomac clean, who told us that the river has actually gotten cleaner over time.  Plus, there’s no evidence that immigrants are especially to blame for any trash floating around the river’s waters. (Fox News did not respond to requests for comment.) The Potomac River has long been considered too polluted for swimming, particularly in and around Washington, D.C., where Carlson lives. Its waters were so bad that in 1965, former President Lyndon Johnson declared the river a ""national disgrace."" But a 2018 report from the Potomac Conservancy, a nonprofit clean-water advocate in the region, found that the Potomac’s overall health has improved dramatically in the last 10 years. Hedrick Belin, president of the group, blasted Carlson for his ""groundless accusation"" in a statement to PolitiFact, calling the Fox News host’s comments ""factually incorrect"" and ""racist."" ""For the first time in generations, we are within reach of fully enjoying a healthy, thriving Potomac River,"" Belin said, noting that river pollutants are in decline as fish are returning. Other experts agreed. ""This is a river that's getting cleaner and cleaner, not 'dirtier and dirtier,'"" said Philip Musegaas, vice president of programs and litigation for the Potomac Riverkeeper Network. The nonprofit called Carlson’s claim ""dead wrong"" in a Facebook post. Musegaas said plans to upgrade the sewer systems in Washington and Alexandria, Va., should eliminate the ""last sources of untreated sewage pollution"" in the nearby metropolitan area. Curtis Dalpra, communications manager for the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin, said different environmental issues affect different parts of the river, which is more than 380 miles long. But generally speaking, the river is cleaner than it was 30 years ago. Still, Carlson was talking specifically about litter, so we also reached out to the Alice Ferguson Foundation, which organizes annual trash cleanups along the riverside and keeps tabs on the total amount of trash and recyclables its volunteers haul out of the Potomac’s shores each year. According to the foundation’s data, less litter was collected in 2019 than in 2007, even as the number of volunteers increased. Specifically, the number of trash-and-recyclable-filled bags per volunteer dropped from an average of 2.14 bags in 2007 to 1.20 in 2019.  At Fletchers’ Cove — a spot that, according to the Washington Post, is roughly a 10-minute drive from Carlson’s house — the average number of bags-per-volunteer went from roughly 2.11 in 2007 to about 1.32 in 2019. Local experts also cast doubt on Carlson’s claim that immigrant litter was at fault. For starters, litter is not the top pollutant soiling the Potomac River’s waters. Belin said nutrients and sediment that flow off the land are the main causes for concern. When they hit the water, they harm wildlife, degrade habitats and taint the water, making it less clean and safe.  Litter is still an issue. But foreign-born people — who make up roughly 14% of the population in Washington, D.C., according to the Census Bureau — are not uniquely prone to littering. ""Littering is definitely a problem, but it is a problem that knows no color or ethnicity,"" Musegaas said. ""Tourists litter, residents litter, and people fishing and boating on the river litter."" Not only that, but most of the trash that ends up in the Potomac River is not deposited directly, experts said. Often, trash left in the street or outside in barrels gets swept by rain into the sewer or the river. Of course, that trash has to come from someone, Dalpra noted. At some point, it was thrown on the ground or stuffed in the trash. And in a dense city like Washington, there’s likely more litter to go around than elsewhere. But that litter ""is really a problem that spans society,"" Dalpra said. While we won’t discount the possibility that Carlson has spotted immigrants tossing trash in the Potomac, there’s no evidence that the litter ""is left almost exclusively by immigrants."" Carlson said the Potomac River ""has gotten dirtier and dirtier and dirtier and dirtier. I go down there and that litter is left almost exclusively by immigrants.""

"""In Bakersfield, where there’s a lot of oil drilling going on, there’s more solar jobs now in Bakersfield and around that area than there are oil jobs.""","Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger likes to boast about his home state’s move to clean energy sources such as wind and solar.  But on Sunday’s Meet the Press on NBC, the GOP politician and climate activist may have gone too far.  Schwarzenegger was on the show promoting World War Zero, a coalition of scientists, politicians and celebrities hoping to bring greater urgency to climate change, ahead of the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference.  He said California’s embrace of renewables is evident even in Bakersfield, a city of 380,000 better known for oil derricks and country music than solar arrays and wind turbines.  ""I just want to tell you that, for instance, in California, in Bakersfield, where there’s a lot of oil drilling going on, there’s more solar jobs now in Bakersfield and around that area than there are oil jobs,"" Schwarzenegger claimed. ""People are leaving the oil fields and going to work in solar and clean energy and stuff like that.""  More solar jobs than oil jobs in the Bakersfield area?  We drilled down on a fact check.  Our research  Our reporting, along with a fact check by Bakersfield NBC TV affiliate KGET, calls Schwarzenegger’s specific claim into question. But it also shows renewable energy jobs are growing in the region.  Asked about the claim solar jobs have overtaken oil positions, Kern County spokesperson Megan Person told the station ""we know that not to be true.""  She said the county is home to approximately 2,500 solar jobs, most of which are temporary and tied to construction and installation.  By comparison, it has about 14,000 jobs directly connected to the oil and gas industry, most of which Person said are permanent oil jobs. She said the figures come from private service JobsEQ.  It’s the same amount listed in a 2017 Oil and Gas in California report by the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation.  Bakersfield is the largest city in Kern County, located south of Fresno and north of Los Angeles. The region, like much of the state, has seen a jump in renewables, but not to a level matching traditional energy jobs.   ""Kern County is seeing a rise in solar installations, and I don’t mean just residential. I mean giant commercial projects,"" Person said, citing a new solar field that will generate 850 solar construction jobs.  ""It could be confusion related to that,"" she continued. ""I don’t know where [Schwarzenegger’s] numbers came from. We can’t substantiate them."" 'It was a mistake'  The former governor’s spokesperson, Daniel Ketchell, told PolitiFact California that Schwarzenegger ""meant to say new jobs. What he said was not meant to mislead. It was a mistake.""  Ketchell clarified that he intended to say the San Joaquin Valley has gained more new clean energy jobs than oil jobs. There’s some evidence for that, but it’s a far different claim than what the governor said on TV. The Valley includes a much bigger area, running from Stockton to Bakersfield, and clean energy goes beyond just solar.  ""Yes, it’s on the rise,"" Carol Zabin, director of the Green Economy Program at the UC Berkeley Labor Center, said of solar and other clean energy sources. ""The big solar farms are located in various parts of the state. But there’s a concentration in the San Joaquin Valley."" Zabin said the Center does not have figures comparing solar and oil jobs in the Bakersfield area. But in a 2017 study, it reported that California’s clean energy initiatives ""created 88,000 total jobs, including 31,000 direct jobs"" in the San Joaquin Valley from 2002 to 2015.  She added that automation has led to a decrease in some oil and gas jobs in the Valley, though she noted demand for fossil fuels continues to be strong.  Our ruling  Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger recently claimed there are more solar jobs than oil jobs in the Bakersfield area.  A spokesperson for Kern County said the area’s solar jobs amount to just 2,500 while the oil and gas industry includes 14,000 positions.  Schwarzenegger’s spokesman told us he meant to say the San Joaquin Valley is seeing more new clean energy jobs than oil jobs. There’s some evidence for that, but it’s far different from what he said on TV",False,"December 6, 2019"
"China today is ""burning seven to eight times the amount of coal that we’re burning in the United States.""","When former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that he would spend $500 million on a Beyond Carbon initiative, West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice joined energy industry representatives at a press conference to denounce the effort. The project Justice criticized aspires to retire all coal use by 2030 while securing an economic future for fossil fuel-producing communities.  In an op-ed announcing the effort, Bloomberg — who has since entered the Democratic presidential primary race — touted an existing partnership between Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Sierra Club that has ""shut down 289 coal-fired power plants since 2011."" The new initiative would build on this effort and also ""work to stop the construction of new gas plants,"" Bloomberg wrote. ""By the time they are built, they will be out of date because renewable energy will be cheaper."" Justice, a Republican whose state is a leading producer of coal and other carbon-based energy, said the effort could be ""catastrophic"" to West Virginia. (Justice himself also inherited a coal mining business and continues to own several mines.) At one point in the press conference, Justice was asked about the environmental impacts of fossil fuels. He responded by questioning the value of the United States cutting back if China is using carbon-based fuels on full blast. ""How does it make sense that in China, they’re burning seven to eight times the amount of coal that we’re burning in the United States?"" Justice asked. Is his comparison accurate? Justice’s ratio is not far from the reported data, though it’s worth noting that the reason for the discrepancy has a lot to do with the fact that China has a much larger population. (His office did not respond to inquiries for this article.) There’s little doubt that, as a whole, coal consumption by China is several times larger than it is in the United States. According to the 2019 BP Statistical Review of World Energy, China’s coal consumption was 1.91 billion tons of oil equivalent in 2018. In the same year, the United States consumed 317 million tons. That means China consumed about six times as much coal as the United States did. Another data source, the Global Energy Statistical Yearbook 2019 published by Enerdata, an energy intelligence and consulting firm, found a nearly identical difference — China was about six times larger than the U.S. in consumption of coal and lignite (a low-efficiency type of coal). Justice didn’t mention it, but another country, India, also consumes more coal than the United States does — 452 million tons of oil equivalent, according to the BP review. We’ll note that the difference in coal consumption between China and the United States is partially explained by the two countries’ difference in population — China has about 4.3 times higher in population than the United States. However, adjusting for population is less significant in this case than it often is, given Justice’s point.  Justice is arguing that greenhouse gases do not stay within national borders; they spread everywhere in the atmosphere. So any decreases in carbon emissions made in the United States will be a relatively small factor compared to China in the global context — regardless of which country has a bigger population. Indeed, according to the BP data, China accounted for just over half of the world’s coal consumption in 2018. In addition, the same data shows that China’s coal consumption increased by 1.8% between 2007 and 2017, whereas U.S. coal consumption declined by 4.9%. Unlike the United States, which has a lot of economically competitive natural gas under development, China doesn’t, said Anna Mikulska, a nonresident fellow in energy studies at the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy. ""China has to go against the economic calculus to retire at least some of the coal if it wants to lower emission levels,"" she said. ""This is why we see China still consuming so much."" Mikulska added that the current trade friction with China ""does not help, as China turns more to domestic or regional resources due to energy security concerns. One of them is coal."" That said, the Paris-based International Energy Agency, has projected that China’s coal consumption will indeed decline over the next two decades. ""This new direction will have consequences that are no less significant for China and the world than its earlier period of energy-intensive development."" Justice said that China today is ""burning seven to eight times the amount of coal that we’re burning in the United States."" The actual number is a little bit less than that — China consumes roughly six times the amount of coal as the United States does. But that’s pretty close",Mostly True,"December 4, 2019"
"""14,000 abandoned wind turbines litter the United States.""","Missouri recently made headlines for planning a new wind project in Boone County, north of Columbia. In April, President Donald Trump made the ""pants on fire"" claim that windmills cause cancer. Locally, renewable energy companies that fund wind energy projects in Missouri have recently made headlines for planning a new wind project in Boone County, just south of Harrisburg. Now, a widely-circulated chain email has resurfaced a claim industry experts have seen all too often: ""14,000 abandoned wind turbines litter the United States."" This isn’t true. Wind energy proponents have been trying to dispel the claim for years, and 14,000 seems to be a fabricated number. The trouble is no one can say exactly how many ""abandoned"" wind turbines there are. Much of the email chain’s content appears to have been copied from an article on a blog site called American Elephants, which describes itself as a home of conservatives. The anonymous blog post was published July 7, 2013, meaning this claim is at least six years old. Wind energy experts have been trying to debunk this claim as a myth for just as long. ""It’s bullshit,"" said Paul Gipe, who has published five books on wind energy since 1995 and who has closely studied California’s wind farms. (Now the American Wind Energy Association does that.) Gipe said there have never been 14,000 abandoned wind turbines in California, in the United States, in North America or anywhere in the world. But at one time, there were approximately 14,000 wind turbines in California, total. He says he is ""the author of that number"" and believes that it is the origin of the 14,000 figure used in the email chain. Experts from the wind energy association agree that the claim is blatantly false, but the organization has struggled to correct the misconception. ""We know for a fact that it’s not true,"" said Kaitlin Monaghan, the association’s deputy director of permitting and asset management policy. ""We’re not sure why it’s been so hard for us to myth-bust it or why it’s kind of still floating around out there, but I think sometimes that’s how it goes."" James Owen, executive director of Renew Energy, a company that champions renewable energy , said he doesn’t know of any abandoned wind turbines in the state of Missouri. He, too, agreed that there is no evidence for the abandoned turbines claim. ""To the extent I’ve seen, there’s absolutely no basis for that,"" Owen said. ""It just seems like a number that was made up."" Monaghan acknowledged that wind turbines age and typically have a useful life of 20 to 30 years. At that time, she said old equipment must be taken down, repaired or replaced. If a project owner chooses to close a wind farm completely, Monaghan explained, it is the responsibility of the owner to decommission the farm, which includes removing wind turbines and restoring the land to its original state. She said there are often local and state laws that require this of individuals operating wind farms. However, 99% of wind projects are built on private land, so lease contracts for land used for turbines often include requirements for project owners to remove turbines and restore land when a project is shut down, Monaghan said. With this in mind, Monaghan explained that there are a number of reasons why project owners would not simply ""abandon"" wind turbines — meaning leave turbines standing despite not being functional. In areas where constructing wind farms requires permits, a project owner must often provide a detailed plan upfront for the eventual decommissioning of the project. Sometimes, owners will even have to provide a ""parent company guarantee,"" or some sort of financial backing, to reassure the community that no abandoned wind turbines will be left behind. On top of this, Monaghan said it would hurt companies’ reputations with landowners if they simply abandoned wind turbines. Turbines also have salvage value; the steel and other materials from a project could be repurposed or sold, Monaghan said. Finally, preexisting farms have already collected extensive wind speed data and have access to transmission lines. Greg Alvarez, deputy director of external communications for the wind energy association, explained that these features are valuable for projects and create ""very, very strong financial incentives to not let these sites sit vacant and abandoned."" As for those who believe companies are installing wind turbines to get a tax credit and then abandoning them, Owen said that was a ""patently absurd"" idea because companies only make money by selling power generated by the turbines. He said it was also a misunderstanding of the tax credit available. ""The tax credits they’re talking about are production tax credits,"" Owen said, ""so they don’t get the tax credit unless they’re producing something."" The U.S. Wind Turbine Database indicates that there are 60,576 turbines operating in the U.S., including Puerto Rico and Guam. In total, wind energy supplies just under 7% of the country’s electricity, according to Alvarez. He said the U.S. wind industry has 97,000 megawatts of installed capacity, which is enough to power about 30 million average American homes. Energy production is tracked and recorded, as is the installation of wind turbines, but no one is tracking the number of abandoned wind turbines. The wind energy association's experts said that at most, there is a small number of nonoperational wind turbines that may appear to be abandoned even if they are not. Beyond that, they couldn’t be more specific. Gipe’s best estimate of the actual number of abandoned U.S. wind turbines was somewhere ""in the hundreds"" but not the thousands. The email chain argues that ""14,000 abandoned wind turbines litter the United States."" There is not now, nor has there ever been, research to support the claim.

"""A study shows that households neighboring West Virginia could be on the hook for upwards of $70,000 in the first year alone under the Green New Deal!""","Republicans have focused their attacks on a congressional Democratic proposal known as the Green New Deal.  The proposal, whose highest-profile champion is Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is aimed at curbing climate change, but Republicans counter that its associated costs will wreck the economy. The House version of the proposal has far-reaching environmental goals, including ""eliminating pollution and greenhouse gas emissions as much as technologically feasible."" It reaches into other domestic policy areas, as well.  One of the GOP lawmakers who took a shot at the Green New Deal is West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito.  Capito took the proposal to task in an Aug. 20 Facebook post: ""Democrats are desperate to implement their Green New Deal. They care little about the cost and will leave you with the bill! A study shows that households neighboring West Virginia could be on the hook for upwards of $70,000 in the first year alone under the Green New Deal! This doesn’t sound like much of a deal to us!""   Capito’s congressional and campaign offices declined to comment for this article, but her Facebook post linked to a Fox Business article that, in turn, cited a study by the Competitive Enterprise Institute on the household effects of the Green New Deal, or GND. ""At a minimum, the GND would impose large and recurring costs on American households,"" the study said. ""We conclude that in four of the five states analyzed — Florida, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania — the GND would cost a typical household more than $70,000 in the first year of implementation, approximately $45,000 for each of the next four years, and more than $37,000 each year thereafter.""  Pennsylvanians could expect a $72,439 hit. In the fifth state, Alaska, the costs would be the highest of all. Travis Burk, a CEI spokesman, said Capito’s Facebook statement ""accurately described"" the study. ""The study looked at the available data in those states and estimated increased costs for electricity production, upgrading vehicles and housing, and elements of shipping,"" Burk said. ""In the interest of fairness, the study is transparent about the inability to estimate a price tag for several of the more costly but vaguely-worded elements of the plan, including a universal job guarantee and guaranteed retirement security for all."" Adding in those other elements would mean that Capito was ""underestimating the potential costs,"" Burk said. There is little doubt that a proposal as sweeping as the Green New Deal would come with a significant price tag. Where Capito’s assertion falls short is in its specificity. The Competitive Enterprise Institute is ""dedicated to advancing the principles of limited government, free enterprise, and individual liberty,"" according to its website — so it’s not surprising that the group would be skeptical of a pro-regulatory plan like the Green New Deal. More to the point, Capito glosses over some of the study’s shortcomings. The Green New Deal is an aspirational blueprint rather than a binding piece of legislation. The proposal doesn’t lay out any cost figures. And it has not received a cost estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office — the gold-standard source on such estimates. As a result, the details of the proposal are vague and open to a range of interpretations. The study itself acknowledges that its calculations require ""a considerable number of assumptions"" — assumptions that other policy specialists say will make specific figures hard to pin down. We have previously fact-checked a statement that, ""at $93 trillion, the Green New Deal would cost more than the entire recorded spending of the U.S. since the Constitution went into effect in 1789."" The $93 trillion figure comes from a high-end estimate by a conservative group, the American Action Forum. The CEI study that Capito relied on cited the American Action Forum as a ""key source"" for its own calculations. As we noted at the time, the American Action Forum report described its estimates as an ""initial foray,"" filled with assumptions and caveats. The Green New Deal ""lacks too many details to seriously model,"" Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, told PolitiFact West Virginia. Capito wrote that ""a study shows that households neighboring West Virginia could be on the hook for upwards of $70,000 in the first year alone under the Green New Deal!""  Capito cites a study by an anti-regulation group that estimated that the one-year cost to a household in neighboring Pennsylvania would be $72,439.  However, experts warn that the costs associated with the Green New Deal are too fuzzy at this point to come up with detailed cost estimates. This position is echoed by the report itself, which acknowledges that its calculations require ""a considerable number of assumptions."" It’s also worth noting that the resolution would be non-binding — if it actually manages to secure congressional approval",Mostly False,"October 8, 2019"
"The Green New Deal ""would put a $600,000 tax burden on every household.""","Critics of the Green New Deal have circulated numerous false claims about the resolution — saying it would do everything from ban farting cows to eliminate air travel. Now the Republican Party of Florida is repeating a familiar talking point that the Green New Deal would create a scary pricetag. ""Democrats are proposing a radical $93 trillion Green New Deal which has been condemned by unions as a job killer and would put a $600,000 tax burden on every household,"" the Florida GOP tweeted Sept. 20. We previously fact-checked a claim that included the $93 trillion figure and rated it False. (President Donald Trump rounds up the claim to $100 trillion.) Here we will explain why the $600,000 figure is misleading, too. We found there is no government analysis of the cost of the Green New Deal per household. This is in part because the Green New Deal expresses goals; it doesn’t lay out specific policies. The $600,000 figure is based on adding up estimates in a report from a right-of-center group that cautioned it was an ""initial foray."" But the GOP talking point exaggerates and oversimplifies the analysis so much that the $600,000 figure can’t be considered accurate. The Green New Deal is a House resolution that U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, introduced in February.  Resolutions are not actual, detailed legislation in themselves. In this case, the Green New Deal resolution in the House — and its companion measure that was introduced in the Senate — address broad principles to curb climate change and protect the environment. The resolutions extend into other domestic policy areas, as well, including jobs and health care.  But the proposal doesn’t lay out any cost figures, and it has not received a cost estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The House resolution was forwarded to several committees and subcommittees for further review. The Republican-led Senate, meanwhile, voted down the measure in March after it was introduced by Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and co-sponsored by many Senate Democrats running for president. The Florida GOP did not respond to our questions about the source of their evidence, but conservative news outlets have cited the $600,000 figure from a February report by the American Action Forum, a right-of-center think tank. The American Action Forum is a sister organization of the American Action Network, a conservative advocacy organization. The American Action Forum acknowledged the difficulty in coming up with a number for the cost, saying that ""the breadth of its proposals makes it daunting to assess"" and that many of the proposed policies are redundant, ""which also complicates a precise analysis."" The report doesn’t mention the $600,000 figure or a total for the estimated per-household cost. However, it does show the estimated per-household cost for different parts of the Green New Deal, some of which were expressed in ranges. The Florida GOP’s tweet said that the Green New Deal  ""would put a $600,000 tax burden on every household"" -- which could suggest a massive tax increase for every family. But the American Action Forum analysis doesn’t actually say that every household will pay that cost in new taxes. And the costs identified in the analysis are spread over about a decade, from 2020 to 2029. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum and a former head of the Congressional Budget Office, told PolitiFact that he stands by the analysis. ""We never actually added it up,"" he said. ""We tried to get the order of magnitude, what are we looking at here? That was the intent of that first piece."" If we add up the high-end range in each category, that adds up to $671,010 between 2020 and 2029. If we added up the low-end range in each category, it adds up to $369,010.  To come up with estimates, the American Action Forum made a series of assumptions, such as that the Green New Deal would lead to enough high-speed rail transit available that air travel becomes unnecessary. The actual text of the resolution does not call for grounding airplanes. (A much-panned FAQ document written by Ocasio-Cortez’s staff said ""we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast."" But a staff-written FAQ carries zero weight legislatively.) The American Action Forum analysis also factored in costs for Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All. However, the text of the Senate resolution itself doesn’t include a statement on Medicare for All -- instead, it more broadly calls for ""high-quality health care."" (At least some of the resolution co-sponsors do support separate legislation Medicare for All however.) Holtz-Eakin said he had hoped more specifics would emerge from proponents allowing a more specific cost analysis, but that hasn’t happened, he said. The Florida GOP tweeted that the Green New Deal ""would put a $600,000 tax burden on every household."" The Green New Deal is a set of goals; it does not impose specific taxes. Instead, the $600,000 number comes from a brief that its author, the right-of-center American Action Forum, acknowledges is a preliminary and rough estimate. The analysis did not say that every household would pay an extra $600,000 in taxes. Instead, it estimated what costs might be under a range of scenarios over a period of 10 years.  It’s possible the resolution will eventually lead to legislation that can be formally analyzed for potential costs, but at this point, such costs can’t be determined",False,"September 27, 2019"
"""Every time we go to court,"" against the Trump administration, ""for the most part, we win.""","Democratic-controlled California has been labeled the ""State of Resistance,"" in large part for challenging the Trump administration in federal court on issues ranging from the environment to immigration to the U.S. census.  As of late September, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra had filed or joined 60 lawsuits against the Trump administration. His office has also filed friend of the court briefs in several additional cases against the administration.  But is California really ""winning"" in court as Becerra and Gov. Gavin Newsom have confidently claimed?  ""We are winning. The vast majority of the lawsuits have been adjudicated in favor of California,"" Newsom said at a news conference on Sept. 16 at the state Capitol.  Becerra has been equally self-assured:  ""Every time we go to court, for the most part, we win,"" Becerra claimed at a late August news conference where he announced one of California’s 14 lawsuits on immigration since the president took office. That suit seeks to block to block Trump administration rules that could indefinitely detain migrant children and their families.  ""If I were a baseball player, my batting average would be the envy of the MLB,"" he quipped in a Mercury-News article in May. ""We’re proving that no one is above the law, including the president of the United States."" We set out to fact check Becerra’s claim: ""Every time we go to court, for the most part, we win.""  Our research CalMatters, a nonprofit news organization, along with a Marquette University political science professor have separately tracked California’s lawsuits against the Trump administration. Records from both generally support Becerra’s claim that the state is winning in court, at least for the cases that have received rulings so far, though they also show the majority of lawsuits are still pending a final decision.  The CalMatters database of 60 lawsuits showed the state had won 16 completed cases and lost two, while 38 are pending and another four were on hold, as of late September.  California has scored some clear victories. In July, it prevailed in its effort to block the Trump administration from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against the move and Trump abandoned his plan. The state also won a case against the administration’s attempt in 2017 to cut off certain federal funds for ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions. A district court ruled the move was unconstitutional. California again sued the administration last year after it withheld money for similar reasons. The state was also victorious in several cases where it sued to ensure federal energy and environmental regulations were implemented.  In February, the state was dealt one of its few defeats following its lawsuit to stop the Trump administration from waiving environmental laws to speed up border wall construction of in California. A federal district judge and later an appeals panel ruled in favor of Trump. The state also lost a case it joined opposing Trump’s ban on travel from several predominantly Muslim countries. The first version of the ban was struck down by a lower court, while a second partially went into effect but then expired. The Supreme Court upheld a third version in June 2018.  Earlier in Becerra’s August news conference, the AG offered a more nuanced and complete version of his statement about California winning in court.  ""Unfortunately, close to 60 times now this administration has taken actions which would harm the people of the state of California. And in most of the cases that we’ve filed, we have been victorious so far in the rulings that we’ve secured,"" Becerra told reporters. A spokesperson for Becerra provided a list of the state’s cases against the Trump administration, along with information about the status of each, though not an explicit win/loss breakdown.  ""Some have concluded, but many are ongoing,"" the spokesperson wrote in an email. ‘California has had great success in court’ Paul Nolette, the Marquette political science professor, is tracking all multi-state lawsuits against the Trump administration. His database includes the majority of cases filed by California against the administration, though not the 13 solo cases the state has filed against it. As of mid-September, Nolette said California had been successful on nearly 90 percent of the multi-state lawsuits that had received at least an initial judgment, though he cautioned that a majority of the cases are still awaiting a final ruling.  ""California has had great success in court against the Trump administration, looking at both those completed cases as well as looking at those other cases that are still working their way up through the system,"" Nolette said.  Here’s how the state has fared, based on Nolette’s data:      • It is involved in 53 multi-state lawsuits against the Trump administration      • Of those, 21 cases have been completed while 32 are pending a final ruling      • Of the 21 completed cases, it has won 16 and lost three. Two were voluntarily dismissed Nolette said California’s record in the pending, multi-state cases is also good.  ""In cases where there’s been some sort of court judgment or ruling, California is 10 and 0. And some of those cases may still be on appeal. So, they could still lose,"" he said. ""But, I think if you combine both of those together (the pending and completed cases), that’s a lot of wins: Really 26 clear wins in these cases, against only three losses."" California’s solo cases Like the multi-state cases, California has had some early success in cases it has brought independently against the Trump administration.  The attorney general’s office described 13 of its 60 lawsuits against the Trump administration as ""California-only suits."" Among those cited by the AG’s office, the state has two clear victories and one loss, according to a review by PolitiFact California.  Nine of the cases are still pending, while one seeking conflict of interest documents from former EPA Director Scott Pruit was settled with the EPA producing the documents when Pruitt resigned last year without admitting guilt.  UC Davis Law School Dean Kevin Johnson agreed California has a successful record in court so far. ""I think generally it’s a fair statement,"" he said of claims California is ‘winning.’ ""It’s not as easy as saying whether a team won a football game, though. Some of these cases are far from completion. For example, in the cases challenging the president’s executive order on punishing and defunding sanctuary jurisdictions, the case isn’t over."" The White House did not respond to a request for comment.  Our ruling  California Attorney General Xavier Becerra claimed at an August news conference, ""Every time we go to court,"" against the Trump administration, ""for the most part, we win.""  A Marquette political science professor and CalMatters, a nonprofit news organization, are separately tracking California’s lawsuits. Their records each show the state has won the vast majority of cases that have received at least an initial or completed ruling.  But that doesn’t mean California has won ""every time we go to court,"" as Becerra put it, even acknowledging his qualifier ""for the most part."" Most cases are still working their way through the courts and have yet to receive final judgments, some of which could go against California. That important caveat is not reflected in Becerra’s claim.   Becerra does, however, offer a more complete statement earlier in the press conference, saying ""in most of the cases that we’ve filed, we have been victorious so far in the rulings that we’ve secured.""  Given this context and California’s early success in court, Becerra’s claim is generally accurate",Mostly True,"September 25, 2019"
"Says aquatic life near Alaska, Canada and Australia have been found with cancer and mutations as a result of the Fukushima nuclear disaster.","A widely shared Facebook post is trying to connect the Japanese nuclear disaster to an increase in cancer among marine life near Alaska, Canada and Australia. The post, which was published Sept. 8, displays three photos of sharks and fish with apparent tumors or lesions on their skin.  ""Sharks are being found with massive cancerous tumors on their bodies. Salmon caught off the coast of Alaska are riddled with cancer,"" the post reads. ""Fukushima has been seeping radioactivity into our oceans daily since 2011, and the oceans are extremely sick because of it.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) And it’s been shared nearly 2,000 times, so we wanted to check it out. The Fukushima nuclear disaster came after a tsunami hit the eastern coast of Japan in 2011, killing more than 18,000 people. The accident occurred at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant between Tokyo and Sendai and resulted in the meltdown of three reactors. It was the worst nuclear accident since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine. While sharks and fish are capable of getting cancerous tumors, the photos in the post are misleading. None have been directly linked to Fukushima, and there’s little evidence to suggest that fish far from Japan have been affected by the disaster. We did reverse image searches for each of the photos included in the Facebook post. The first image, which shows a shark with what appear to be tumors around its mouth, dates back to at least 2013. That’s when a website called Live Science published it as part of a story about why sharks get cancer. ""It's unknown what caused the tumors in the great white or bronzer shark,"" Live Science wrote of the photo. ""However, reports of cancerous tumors in marine animals, especially mammals, have steadily increased over the past 20 years, raising concerns that industrial pollutants or human activities may trigger the cancers."" The story — which was based on a 2013 study — doesn’t mention Fukushima specifically or nuclear disasters more broadly as having an effect. (Screenshot from Facebook) The second photo, which shows a fish with a lesion on its skin, is at least seven years old. We found it in a story published by the website ZME Science in November 2012, which covered how Canadian researchers had found contaminants near oil sands operations.  The third image included in the Facebook post is a little more ambiguous. A search for it using TinEye, a tool that searches the internet for images, surfaced a 2012 Al Jazeera story about the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. It reported that the image shows a shrimp with mutations as a result of the spill. None of the stories mentioned nuclear radioactivity as having contributed to the lesions. The Facebook post took three photos out of context. But does it have a larger point about the effect of Fukushima on fish? Generally, no, but the answer is a little more complicated. The post specifically mentions salmon off the coast of Alaska as being ""riddled with cancer."" But a public statement from the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation rebuts that, saying testing results have not indicated measurable levels of Fukushima-related radionuclides — radioactive atoms — in Alaskan seafood. ""(The Food and Drug Administration) has found no evidence that radionuclides of health concern from the Japanese nuclear power plant disaster are present in the U.S. food supply,"" the statement reads. Some scientists have found salmon with trace amounts of cesium 134 — a radioactive element specifically associated with the Fukushima disaster — in Canadian waters. But the levels were 10,000 times lower than health safety guidelines. As for the Great Barrier Reef, another area specifically mentioned in the post, the link between Fukushima and fish is just as weak. In a public statement published by the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, officials said they hadn’t detected any substantial radioactivity off the coast. ""Ongoing monitoring programs are in place that continue to monitor for the Fukushima signature, but it is expected that by the time it reaches Australian waters, the radioactive material will have been diluted to such low levels that it will be undetectable,"" the statement reads. In this Aug. 26, 2013 photo, fisherman Fumio Suzuki sorts out fish he caught aboard his boat Ebisu Maru in the waters off Iwaki, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the tsunami-crippled Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant, Japan. (AP) Japan is a different story.  A 2012 study found elevated levels of cesium in fish directly off the coast of Fukushima, and the government banned the sale of certain species of sea life that surpassed 100 becquerels per kilogram. Those bans slowly tapered off until February of this year, when officials noticed a spike in cesium-tainted fish off the Fukushima coast. But since the disaster, the government has implemented a massive decontamination effort, which has preserved the safety of most of the country’s fish and agriculture. None of that is to say radioactive contamination of sea life outside Japan is impossible. Scientists and reporters studying the long-term effects of Fukushima warn that radiation will continue to seep into the Pacific Ocean for years to come. But as of now, those effects are measurable mostly in the waters right off the coast of the disaster site — and even there, most fish are safe to eat. A Facebook post claimed that several species of marine life near Alaska, Canada and Australia have been found with cancer, mutations and radiation as a result of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. None of the photos included in the post have been linked to radiation from the disaster, or even to Japan in general. Studies show that sharks and other marine life are capable of getting cancerous tumors and lesions, albeit not exclusively because of radiation. And while scientists have found elevated levels of radioactive elements in fish off the coast of Fukushima, most sea life is safe to consume — and officials in the U.S. and Australia have not found similar radiation.

"Says she ""sued Exxon Mobil"" as California attorney general.","During a climate town hall on CNN this week, Democratic presidential candidate and California Sen.

In answer to a direct question, she claimed she already did that as California’s attorney general.  ""So, Senator Harris, what would you do? Would you sue them? Sue Exxon Mobil?"" asked moderator Erin Burnett. ""I have sued Exxon Mobil,"" Harris replied.  Did she?  Environmental groups questioned her response.  We decided to fact check it.   Our research We found Harris’ office investigated Exxon in 2016 over allegations it lied to the public and its shareholders about the risk to its business from climate change. The Los Angeles Times detailed that probe in a January 2016 news article. It said Exxon rejected the allegations.   But there’s no public record, and nothing that Harris’ campaign could provide, to show she filed a lawsuit against the company.  ""The facts are Harris opened an investigation against Exxon for lying about climate change. She didn’t take that further even though she should have and other attorney generals did,"" said Kassie Siegel, climate director at the Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund. ""She did bring some cases against oil companies. I’m not aware of a case that she actually brought against Exxon. And she didn’t bring the case against Exxon for lying about climate change.""  Ian Sams, a campaign spokesman for Harris, told us she ""launched an investigation into Exxon,"" but he would not directly address her claim that she sued the company.  He told The New York Times that, ""as attorney general (Harris) sued Chevron, BP, ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66 for pollution activities, helping win $50 million in settlements."" Sams provided PolitiFact California with links to articles and news releases supporting those actions.  In their own fact checks, the Times and CNN reported they found no evidence supporting Harris’ claim that she sued Exxon.  ""As Cal AG, Harris opened a file shortly after the #ExxonKnew news broke in fall 2015.

"The Green New Deal ""would do away with commercial air travel.""","When asked about the Green New Deal during CNN’s climate change town hall, Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang said he embraced the plan, with one caveat: Its deadline for ending air travel is too tight, he said. ""The only issue I have with the Green New Deal is the timing of the timeline,"" Yang said. ""I mean, they are right that we need to take urgent action, but the timeline that they put out there would do away with commercial air travel and a lot of other things in a particular time frame, that, if we have a little bit more time, we can head in the same direction and achieve most of the same value."" But Yang got his facts mixed up. The Green New Deal makes no mention of air travel, much less doing away with it. U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., unveiled a House version of the Green New Deal Feb. 7. In the Senate, Massachusetts Democrat Ed Markey introduced a companion measure. Broadly speaking, these resolutions express aspirations to curb climate change and protect the environment by investing in renewable energy and infrastructure, in a way that’s equitable and creates jobs. Even if it were to pass both chambers, the resolution is nonbinding.  The initial proposal was met with great fanfare among Democrats. The House version had 89 Democratic co-sponsors, and nearly a dozen Democratic senators — including presidential candidates Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren — sponsored their chamber’s version. So what does the Green New Deal say about air travel? In a word, nothing. It makes no mention of airplanes at all. It does call for ""overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible,"" which includes ""investment in high-speed rail."" Yang’s campaign did not respond to our request for comment. But his mixup may trace back to the Green New Deal’s sloppy rollout — which became the basis of the (mostly Republican) talking point about Democrats wanting to phase out commercial air travel. Around the time of the Green New Deal’s unveiling, Ocasio-Cortez’s office released a frequently asked questions, or FAQ, as a supplement to the plan. The document mentioned airplanes twice, stating (emphasis ours) ""we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast, but we think we can ramp up renewable manufacturing and power production, retrofit every building in America, build the smart grid, overhaul transportation and agriculture, plant lots of trees and restore our ecosystem to get to net-zero."" The FAQ also called for the United States to ""totally overhaul transportation by massively expanding electric vehicle manufacturing, build charging stations everywhere, build out high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary, create affordable public transit available to all, with goal to replace every combustion-engine vehicle."" Republican politicians, including President Donald Trump, senators and conservative media outlets pounced on the idea that the Democrats wanted to make air travel obsolete. Ocasio-Cortez’s press office did not reply for this fact-check, but her chief of staff previously said that there were many shared documents among various interest groups, and that the release of this particular document was a mistake. Fact-checkers at PolitiFact, the Washington Post and Factcheck.org have all debunked the claim. But as Yang’s statement shows, the notion persists. When we previously looked at this claim, experts on climate change told us it’s important to focus on the language in the actual resolution and not the FAQ, which carries no weight. ""It seems to me those lines from the FAQ were lighthearted and ill-considered, and it’s not clear why they were posted,"" said Sean Hecht, Co-Executive Director, Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at UCLA law school. Air travel retains a unique role in moving people long distances. ""When people rank the difficulty of finding structural solutions to greenhouse gas emissions in various sectors, air travel is one of the hardest both technologically and practically, and there aren’t serious policy proposals yet that would solve the issue through limiting air travel or changing the energy sources for commercial aircraft on a significant scale,"" Hecht said. ""So it’s not a priority for policy."" In the long run, electric planes may be feasible, said Paul Bledsoe, a strategic advisor at the Progressive Policy Institute and a lecturer on environmental policy at American University. ""No serious climate experts advocate ending air travel — that's simply a red-herring,"" said Bledsoe, who was a climate change advisor to the Clinton White House. Yang said the Green New Deal ""would do away with commercial air travel."" The resolution makes no mention of ending air travel. Instead, it calls for ""overhauling transportation systems,"" which includes ""investment in high-speed rail."" His claim may trace back to a Republican talking point, based on a messaging document from Democrats that mentioned, perhaps in jest, getting rid of ""farting cows and airplanes."" But we found no evidence that getting rid of airplanes is a serious policy idea from climate advocates",False,"September 6, 2019"
"""When two large whales do the nasty there’s sometimes this one bro who just sort of holds them up so they don’t float off.""","Woe, to be a third wheel. Or a third whale.  At least, a recent Facebook post equates the two.  ""Third whaling,"" says the Aug. 19 post, which features an illustration of two whales seemingly mating and a third underneath them. ""So apparently when two large whales do the nasty there’s sometimes this one bro who just sort of holds them up so they don’t float off. Nature is beautiful.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Nature is beautiful, but what’s happening here is a little less love, a little more war.  ""Good story!"" Scott Kraus, chief marine mammals scientist at the Anderson-Cabot Center for Ocean Life, said about the Facebook post. ""But entirely fictional. Why one male would help another secure a copulation? It makes no sense biologically to give up creating your genetically related offspring to help your buddy."" Many observations of mating groups in right, bowhead and gray whales have led people to think males are helping one another to get the female, Kraus said. ""But it is mostly competition, pure and simple.""  Quoting from the book ""Gray Whales"" by David G. Gordon and Alan Baldridge, a 2000 New York Times Q&A says that ""two courting bulls often follow the same cow, forming tightly knit trios that remain intact right up to the moment of conception.""  The idea that any extra males held the mating whales together to brace them has been ""mostly dismissed as a misinterpretation of what is going on in a process that is difficult to study,"" according to the Times. Different whale species behave differently. The contests between male humpback whales can be violent, or deadly, according to a 2008 Smithsonian Magazine story, as male whales attack each other underwater vying for the female’s attention.  In August 2000, meanwhile, a female North American Right whale was observed by scientists simultaneously having sex with two males. Kraus told us that when female whales remain with their blowholes upright and swimming forward, they may be ensuring that only males fit enough to keep up and hold their breath for long periods of time can mate with her. In right whales, he said, ""it’s likely that the female instigates this behavior by calling — the more males, the more competition, the more likely she is to get the best male."" A 2015 video posted on YouTube by National Geographic shows gray whales the magazine says ""may be engaged in a ‘three way.’ "" ""It’s common to see two male gray whales courting a female,"" the text that appears over the video reads. ""They take turns attempting to mate with her. Body alignment is important in these 35-feet plus mammals. One male supports the female as the other attempts to mate with her."" An accompanying article quotes a gray whale researcher saying: ""Many times gray whales do mating triads, and at times one male props the other male up to mate and then they flip flop positions.""  These statements seem to support the Facebook post, but we wanted to know more. We reached out to Mark Girardeau, the wildlife photographer who used a drone to record the footage of the whales that National Geographic posted. He told us that the information in the New York Times Q&A that challenges the notion of a third ""helper"" whale is accurate. ""Many species have never even been documented mating, so we just don’t know,"" he said. ""Gray whales were previously thought to have only mated in threes for support, but I’ve also recently found out that it is just two males competing, and it’s just a matter of which bull’s semen does the job.""  We asked Trevor Branch, a professor at the School of Aquatic and Fisheries Sciences at the University of Washington, about the ""third whaling"" claims.  ""Sounds super unlikely,"" he told us in an email. ""Often there are two males competing to mate with the female, and it might appear (as) if one is below (and) that it’s supporting the mating couple.""  He pointed us to a recent article in Marine Mammal Science that he notes was ""about this exact scenario in blue whales."" The article says that escorting behavior, in which a male accompanies a female, is known to happen among animals including humpback whales, African elephants and some primate species.  ""Escorting allows a male to defend a female, limiting access of other males to the female and thereby increasing the likelihood of siring potential offspring,"" the article says. ""Rival males may challenge the escorting male to take his place… . In the Gulf of St. Lawrence, it is often observed that when a blue whale pair is joined by a third whale — usually a male — the trio starts coursing, racing high out of the water involving vigorous surface displays causing explosive splashes and bow waves. This behavior can either end with the intruding male leaving the pair or the primary escort being replaced by the intruding male."" Rob Williams, chief scientist with Oceans Initiative, told us that back in the 1980s, there was a theory of mating trios including ""helpers"" among gray whales. ""But I think even the authors noted that was speculation,"" Williams said. ""I’m not aware of any genetic evidence emerging over the last 30 years that those third whales are actually helpers."" Philip Clapham, former program leader of the Cetacean Assessment and Ecology Program and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, was blunter when we asked him about the Facebook post. ""The idea that one male holds up a mating pair is complete and utter bulls---,"" he said.  In some species of whales, multiple males compete for the same female,"" he told us.

"The Amazon rainforest fires are ""directly related to trade"" tensions between the United States and China.","At first glance, U.S.-Chinese trade tensions may seem unrelated to the surge of wildfires in the Amazon rainforest. But one Democratic presidential candidate is linking the environmental devastation to President Donald Trump’s trade war with Beijing. John Delaney’s argument is that tit-for-tat tariffs between the economic superpowers have decimated U.S. soybean exports to China. As a result, he said, farmers in Latin America are now incentivized to take extreme measures to feed their newly expanded Chinese market.  ""In reality, (the Amazon wildfires are) directly related to trade. The fact that U.S. farmers can't sell soybeans to China has created an opportunity for Brazil to sell soybeans to China,"" John Delaney said Aug. 27 on Fox News. ""As a result, farmers are tearing down the Amazon to grow soybeans."" We found that while those two dots — the U.S.-Chinese trade war and Amazon wildfires — can be connected, Delaney exaggerated the link.   Experts who study ancient environments say farmers have been burning the Amazon rainforest for millenia. So why have this year’s fires have garnered so much attention? Because there haven’t been this many fires since 2012.  More than 95,000 fires were ablaze in the Brazilian Amazon at last count, which represents a 59% increase from around this time last year, according to the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research. The number changes daily. While this year is not on track to be record-breaking, the amount of fire is ""relatively high compared to recent years,"" Mikaela Weisse and Sarah Ruiz of the World Resource Institute wrote. Environmental experts believe humans are responsible for the vast majority of these wildfires, intentionally or not So what’s that got to do with U.S.-Chinese trade relations? Under Delaney’s logic, Trump’s trade war with China set in motion retaliatory tariffs against U.S. soybean farmers. And increasingly, Chinese soybean buyers have looked to farmers in Brazil, where Amazon lands could be used to cultivate the crop — even if it means burning rainforest to clear more arable land.   The U.S. Soybean Export Council, a trade association, expects American soybean exports to China this year to be about one-third of last year. At the same time, Brazil has replaced the United States as the biggest supplier of soybeans, according to the South China Morning Post. While Brazil has been selling soybeans to China for years, the U.S.-Chinese trade war has been a welcomed development for Brazil’s soybean farmers. ""We are prepared to take advantage of the trade war to increase our business with China and further build trade relations,"" Igor Brandao, chief of the agribusiness division of Brazil’s trade promotion agency, told the South China Morning Post.    We reached out to experts from a variety of fields — economics, trade, politics, environmental sciences — who told is that no single factor alone is responsible for the uptick in Amazon wildfires this year. While the U.S.-Chinese trade war is certainly one factor, it should not be given the most weight, some experts told us. The more direct cause lies with decisions by Brazil’s political and business leaders.  South American farmers and ranchers have long sought more Amazon lands to raise cattle and grow crops. In countries where the Amazon lies — Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Peru — there are laws against deforestation, but enforcement has been inconsistent.    While previous Brazilian presidents have exercised relatively tighter control over the rainforest, the administration of President Jair Bolsonaro, who took office at the start of 2019, has taken a more hands-off approach in order to encourage more agricultural activity and development. Some experts we spoke to said this was the true spark — not strained U.S.-Chinese trade relations. ""The main economic reason for the fires is pent-up demand — under previous Brazilian presidents — for new acreage for cattle and crops,"" said Gary Hufbauer, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, which supports free trade. ""The Bolsonaro government relaxed controls and the burning escalated. ""While I deplore Trump’s trade war,"" he said, ""I think the tie to Amazon fires is remote."" A National Geographic analysis of data from the Global Fire Emissions Database also concluded that the uptick in fires is a result of the Bolsonaro administration’s laxer regulation. ""In Brazil — which controls the majority of the vast forest — regulations were put into place over a decade ago to curb the expanse of deforestation,"" National Geographic reported. ""But these rules have been loosened by the new Brazilian administration, and consequently fires are spiking."" Delaney’s campaign pointed us to a number of press reports that drew a connection between Trump’s trade war with China and the burning Amazon rainforests.  The Trump administration's trade war with China has ""provided some economic incentive to clear the Amazon forests via fire,"" said Ross Burkhart, a political science professor at Boise State University who specializes in environmental policy. But he added that any connection is an indirect one, and somewhat beside the main point.   ""Focusing on that impact takes away from the more direct causal factors,"" he said, ""which in my view involve internal decisions made by Brazilian agricultural, business, and political leaders."" Delaney said the Amazon rainforest fires are ""directly related to trade"" tensions between the United States and China. U.S.-Chinese trade tensions have expanded South American farmers’ opportunity to sell soybeans in China, which in turn has created an economic incentive to burn Amazon land so it can be used for crop production. But a more direct cause of the surge in wildfires is the loosening of deforestation rules under the current Brazilian government that favor the country’s agricultural and business interests",False,"September 6, 2019"
"""Trump is as destructive a person in this century as Hitler, Stalin, and Mao were in the last century. He may be responsible for many more million deaths than they were.""","Does President Donald Trump rank alongside the 20th century’s bloodiest dictators? A prominent psychiatrist said so during an interview on CNN. Allen James Frances, the chairman emeritus of Duke University’s department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, appeared on CNN’s ""Reliable Sources,"" a program hosted by Brian Stelter that analyzes the news media.  Frances – who played a key role in the publication of the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the reference work that defines recognized psychiatric conditions – was brought on the show to discuss how the media should cover those who question Trump’s mental fitness for office. Frances warned against ""medicalizing politics,"" but he expressed concern about Trump: ""Trump is as destructive a person in this century as Hitler, Stalin, and Mao were in the last century. He may be responsible for many more million deaths than they were. He needs to be contained, but he needs to be contained by attacking his policies, not his person."" After some Twitter users attacked Frances for comparing Trump to Adolf Hitler of Germany, Josef Stalin of the Soviet Union, and Mao Zedong of China – and criticized Stelter for allowing Frances’ comment to go unchallenged – Stelter took responsibility, citing technical difficulties that had distracted him during Frances’ comment. Frances also elaborated on Twitter, saying he was referring to the future death toll from climate change, hastened by Trump’s policies: ""Terrible damage Trump is doing to world climate at this global warming tipping point may be irreversable/could kill hundreds of millions of people in the coming decades. Many of them our children & grandchildren & their children. This is an existential crisis for humanity."" We decided to take a closer look at Frances’ original comment. In interviews with PolitiFact, historians of the 20th century and experts on climate change both agreed that Frances made an extraordinarily flawed comparison to put Trump in the company of Hitler, Stalin, and Mao. ""Much as I abhor Trump’s climate policies, calling him Hitler seems inappropriate to me,"" said Rob Jackson, a Stanford University professor of earth system science. ""Trump’s climate and environmental policies are destructive. Calling him Hitler, though, is a distraction. It helps him marginalize criticism."" ""Frances’s statement is shockingly stupid and uninformed for someone with a respectable and responsible position,"" said Benjamin Hett, a historian at Hunter College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and author of ""The Death of Democracy: Hitler’s Rise to Power and the Downfall of the Weimar Republic."" Frances did not respond to inquiries for this article. A spokesman for Duke said that Frances is retired from the university and has no current responsibilities.  The death toll for each of the three 20th century dictators is subject to some disagreement and  margin of error, but authoritative accountings suggest that each was responsible for the deaths of at least 10 million or more. Yale University historian Timothy Snyder estimated in 2011 that Hitler caused between 11 million and 12 million deaths of noncombatants, and that Stalin caused a similar number if you include deaths from disease and famine.  Meanwhile, one calculation by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum estimated more than 17 million deaths caused by Hitler. Combat deaths from World War II, would push the number higher still. (Since Hitler and Stalin faced off in World War II, there’s a risk of double-counting in such calculations.) Mao, for his part, may have exceeded them both. Ian Johnson, the author of ""The Souls of China: The Return of Religion After Mao,"" estimated in 2018 that Mao was responsible for perhaps 42.5 million deaths, of which the largest number came from a preventable famine stemming from his Great Leap Forward policy. A 2014 World Health Organization analysis found that ""climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year between 2030 and 2050,"" from such varied causes as heat exposure to the elderly, diarrhea, malaria, and malnutrition. Using the 250,000-a-year figure, it would take about 40 years of Trump-related deaths from climate change to meet the low end of the Hitler and Stalin death counts. To reach Mao’s death toll of 42.5 million, it would take 170 years.  In early 2019, Andy Haines and Kristie Ebi, environmental and health specialists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, called the WHO calculation ""a conservative estimate"" in a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine. But even if the WHO estimate is low, it’s clear that you’d have to stick Trump with the blame for many decades worth of global deaths from climate change to compete with Hitler, Stalin or Mao. Even experts who decry Trump’s climate policies note that any future deaths will not be solely attributable to him.  The process has been underway long before Trump entered the Oval Office. In addition, countless other factors – from corporate policies to individuals’ own actions – have brought us to where we are today.  ""When Trump took office, we were already committed to the ocean and atmospheric warming that we are seeing now, the basically irreversible acceleration in polar ice melt we are seeing now, the accelerating melt of permafrost and its effects we are seeing now, and the accelerating sea level rise we are seeing now,"" said Harold R. Wanless, a professor of geography and regional studies at the University of Miami. Given this, Wanless said, the blame should be shared with all preceding administrations and congresses since about 1979, ""when it became apparent that climate change was happening, was starting to produce these changes, was basically irreversible, and would be made worse and worse as we added more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.""  Wanless termed Frances’ comparison ""naïve, irresponsible, and purely political."" Peter Fritzsche, a University of Illinois historian, told PolitiFact that ""it seems silly to find a single embodiment to the problem of climate change,"" he said. ""Trump is a poster boy of ignorance, but the problem is much much larger, more serious, more difficult."" Fritzsche suggested a different comparison – presidents such as Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan whose inaction made the Civil War inevitable. ""I would compare Trump to the weak presidents of the 1850s who completely failed to see -- purposefully -- the conflict between North and South, the expansion of slavery in the West, and the issue of fugitive slaves,"" he said. Frances said, ""Trump is as destructive a person in this century as Hitler, Stalin, and Mao were in the last century. He may be responsible for many more million deaths than they were."" Not only does Frances’ comparison exaggerate the predicted climate change death toll compared to that of the dictators, he also lays the blame for potential future deaths at Trump’s feet alone, which even experts critical of Trump consider wrongheaded",False Pants on Fire,"August 26, 2019"

Starting in the 1980s, some courts in the U.S. began awarding plaintiffs exposed to hazardous substances payment for diagnostic tests and other procedures for early detection of diseases they face an increased risk of developing due to exposure. Those cases are referred to as ""medical monitoring"" claims.  Bennington’s two senators, Democrats Dick Sears and Brian Campion, had sponsored a bill, S.37, in response to the contamination of private wells around Bennington with PFOA from the ChemFab plant in town.  Under S.37, Vermonters without a disease would have a ""cause of action"" to sue a company that exposed them to toxic substances through wrongful conduct for medical monitoring costs. Before awarding medical monitoring, a court would have to find that the exposure increases the risk of developing a disease. A medical expert would also have to deem that diagnostic testing beyond normal medical checkups to be reasonably necessary. Only businesses of 10 or more employees — or of 500 or more employees at multiple facilities — in the mining, manufacturing, transportation and utility sectors could be sued for medical monitoring costs under S.37.  The state discovered the Bennington area contamination in 2016. The Department of Health offered Bennington area residents testing for PFOA levels in their blood.  PFOA is one of the most toxic chemicals of the man-made PFAS chemicals. PFAS, which stands for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, do not break down in the environment and are used in a wide array of manufactured products, from rain jackets to cookware to firefighting foam. Scientists now know that exposure to certain PFAS chemicals can lead to cancer, thyroid disease, immune system damages, developmental problems in children and low birth weight.Proponents of the medical monitoring bill argue that companies that release toxic pollutants -- not the state or exposed individuals -- should have to pay for that medical testing.  A similar proposal was vetoed last year by Gov. Phil Scott, who said it created an ""unprecedented"" level of liability for Vermont businesses. During a House floor debate on the bill last week, Rep. Scott Beck, R-St. Johnsbury, introduced an amendment to S.37 favored by industry representatives that sets more stringent criteria for people in an exposed area to receive medical monitoring.  Multiple lawmakers rose to speak in favor of the amendment. Rep. Heidi Scheuermann, R-Stowe, said representatives from the manufacturing industry ""came to Montpelier this year"" with the intent of supporting medical monitoring legislation.  ""They understand the importance (of medical monitoring),"" she said on the House floor last Thursday, referring to industry. ""It’s clear, though, that they want to do it in a way that is consistent with other states and S.37 just isn’t."" Sen. Brian Collamore, R-Rutland, and Sen. Bobby Starr, D-Essex-Orleans, echoed similar concerns during Senate floor debate on the bill this week.  The bill passed both the House and the Senate, but is unlikely to get the governor's signature. So we were wondering, if S.37 becomes law, would Vermont be an outlier compared to the rest of the country? In an interview Wednesday, Scheuermann said that her statement came from concerns expressed by industry representatives and lobbyists. In particular, they felt the so-called ""test"" for medical monitoring in S.37 was too lenient and would impact their ability to obtain insurance, she said.  ""GlobalFoundries testified, the Vermont Chamber of Commerce testified, (Associated Industries of Vermont) testified, all pointing out the specifics of how it is out of line with other states and what that impact could be to manufacturers in our state and their ability to obtain liability insurance,"" she said.  Scheuermann also directed VTDigger to a state-by-state comparison of medical monitoring from Jill Rickard, director of policy at the state Department of Financial Regulation.  In Rickard’s comparison, five of the six states and territories referenced — Guam, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Florida — require plaintiffs demonstrate either significant exposure to a toxic substance or exposure greater than background levels. Courts in Guam, Florida and Pennsylvania all say that the plaintiff must have a ""significantly"" increased risk of contracting a ""serious"" latent disease. Beck’s amendment would have required exposure to a toxic substance be ""significant."" It also would have changed ""greater risk of contracting a latent disease"" to a ""significantly increased risk of contracting a serious latent disease."" The argument between industry representative and environmental advocates on the latest version centers on whether or not to include those adjectives in the medical monitoring test in S.37.  There is little disagreement that if S.37 is signed by Gov. Phil Scott, Vermont would be the first state in the country to put the right to sue for medical monitoring into state law, and not leave the decision only to a court. So far, courts in 16 states have recognized medical monitoring claims, while 13 states have denied those claims, arguing a medical condition must arise first, according to a white paper by Ken Rumelt, a professor at Vermont Law School.  This week, 38 industry associations around the state sent a letter to senators, urging them to vote against the bill.  ""The major flaw with this legislation is that it is not consistent with what courts in other states have held regarding medical monitoring claims,"" the groups wrote in the letter. ""This will increase operational risks and costs for a wide range of Vermont employers, and make Vermont an outlier even compared to other states that have recognized this as a remedy for plaintiffs."" State and federal courts in nine jurisdictions include the requirement that the plaintiff show they are at a ""significantly increased risk"" of developing a ""serious"" disease, according to a handout from an industry lobbyist. And courts in seven jurisdictions require the plaintiff to show that exposure was either ""significant"" or ""above background levels.""  But proponents of the bill argue that the test for medical monitoring in S.37 is not that different than in other jurisdictions. ""Despite what you have heard, the test for medical monitoring in S.37 is not materially different than the test that exists in other states,"" wrote Jon Groveman, policy and water program director for Vermont Natural Resources Council, and Ken Rumelt, senior attorney at Vermont Law School, in testimony at the end of April.  They go on to write that, in some ways, the bill would set ""more stringent"" conditions for medical monitoring claims than other states. For example, no other states have limited medical monitoring claims to large facilities or specific industries like in S.37. Groveman and Rumelt also reference a case pending in federal court brought by Bennington residents exposed to PFOA seeking medical monitoring costs, among other damages. Judge Geoffrey Crawford issued a preliminary ruling in the ongoing Bennington case that lays out a less strict test than in S.37, they say.  In a white paper he prepared for Vermont Natural Resources Council and VPIRG, Rumelt describes the ""high bar"" plaintiffs must prove to qualify for medical monitoring from West Virginia’s Bower case. Under that eight-part test, plaintiffs must show they’ve been ""significantly exposed"" to a proven hazardous substance, putting them at an increased risk for developing a ""serious latent disease.""  ""I think it’s, to a large degree, equivalent to the Bower’s test,"" Rumelt said of S.37.   In the Bower case, ""significant exposure"" is defined as the plaintiff being exposed to a hazardous substance.  Rumelt and other proponents of the bill say that the requirement in S.37 that a physician has to testify that a plaintiff’s exposure would make additional testing beyond what is generally prescribed ""reasonably necessary"" speaks to the significance of exposure and seriousness of disease.  In an email, Groveman listed tests for medical monitoring in some of the states where courts have allowed it. California does require a plaintiff to show the ""significance and extent of exposure"" and the ""seriousness of diseases for which the plaintiff is at an increased risk,"" but  does not require the plaintiff to show that he or she is at a seriously increased risk.  In Utah, the plaintiff must show that exposure puts them at risk of developing a ""serious disease, illness or injury"" but not that there was significant exposure or a significantly increased risk. In Missouri, there is not a list of elements, but the court allowed a claim when a plaintiff has a ""significantly increased risk of contracting a particular disease relative to what would be the case in the absence of exposure.""  And in New York, courts are all over the map in whether or not they recognize medical monitoring claims. In a class action case ruling involving the National Hockey League Players’ Concussion Injury Litigation, the U.S. District Court of Minnesota reviewed medical monitoring common law throughout the country. The plaintiffs had sought to group together 28 jurisdictions that they claim allow medical monitoring. ""Plaintiffs’ grouping theory cannot be used to sidestep the widespread divergence among the states in the requirements for medical monitoring,"" Judge Susan Richard Nelson writes.  In her conclusion, Nelson cites ""widespread differences in the applicable state laws governing medical monitoring"" as a reason not to grant class certification to the plaintiffs.  Rep. Heidi Scheuermann said: ""They understand the importance (of medical monitoring). It’s clear, though, that they want to do it in a way that is consistent with other states and S.37 just isn’t."" It's true that Vermont would be the first state in the country to actually put a right to medical monitoring in state statute. Vermont would not be alone in allowing for medical monitoring ahead of a disease. Sixteen states have allowed for medical monitoring claims, while 13 state have rejected those claims. Some courts lay out more stringent criteria for medical monitoring tests, based on significance of exposure, extent of increased risk and seriousness of latent disease.  However, not all courts include those qualifiers in their tests for medical monitoring. S.37 also sets limits on what types of businesses could be sued for medical monitoring in a way that other courts have not done. And a judge in a Vermont federal court has issued a preliminary ruling that could set an arguably less strict threshold for medical monitoring claims than S.37",Half True,"May 24, 2019"

A reverse-image search shows that the photo was published in a story by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in September 2009 to illustrate the trashed lawn. The newspaper reported that crews collected about ""70 tons of trash"" following the tailgate. A local radio station also uses the same photo, credited to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, in a 2011 story about the university’s tailgating policies. The caption explains the scene was ""in front of the University of Georgia Law Library one Sunday morning in September 2009, the aftermath of tailgating activities during a football game the night before.""

"Says a deer became ""riddled with tumors from eating plants sprayed with Monsanto’s Roundup.""","A disturbing photograph of a white-tailed deer covered with large tumors is back to making the rounds on social media. Text above the photo says, ""A deer became riddled with tumors from eating plants sprayed with Monsanto’s Roundup. It seems fairly common."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The hairless protrusions are called Cutaneous fibromas, commonly referred to as deer warts, and are found in deer herds in a majority of U.S. states, according to a report by the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks. As a result, the organization says, the warts are considered to exist in the entirety of the white-tailed deer range. But such fibromas are not caused by ""Monsanto’s Roundup,"" or any other herbicide. The warts are caused by a viral infection believed to be transmitted through various biting insects. The viral agent may also be transmitted through direct contact with damaged skin. Once the virus enters the skin, the warts have been found to start forming within about seven weeks. The disease is also temporary, researchers say, and only lasts about two months before it starts to regress in most deer. Kevin Hynes, a wildlife biologist at New York’s Department of Environmental Conservation, confirmed to PolitiFact by email that the protrusions in the photo are, in fact, fibromas. ""They are fairly common in N.Y. deer and are caused by a virus spread by biting insects or by direct contact; the virus does not infect humans or pets,"" Hynes wrote. ""Fibromas are typically found in younger deer and they usually regress, dry up and fall off leaving no evidence they were ever there. Fibromas only cause problems for deer if they cover the eyes or are very large and/or numerous (as in your photo) and become secondarily infected with bacteria.’"" While their appearance may be grotesque, fibromas are not typically harmful to the deer, according to a 2011 publication by the USDA National Wildlife Research Center. However, the report says, deer with heavy tumor loads may suffer from ""exhaustion and incapacitation due to tumors interfering with vision, respiration, food ingestion, and locomotion."" Occasionally, researchers say, the fibromas can create a bacterial infection. While our efforts to find the origin of this photograph using reverse-image searches were not conclusive, fact-checking website TruthOrFiction reported it first appeared in October 2017 on a Facebook page for hunters in a post that went over the actual cause for the growths.

"""We now have longitudinal data that shows that children born around Superfund sites have dramatically higher rates of birth defects, dramatically higher rates of autism.""","As part of Sen. Cory Booker’s presidential primary campaign, the New Jersey Democrat talks about ""environmental justice"" — which seems to mean addressing the environmental factors that disproportionately affect people who are low-income and from minority backgrounds. One issue he’s highlighting: the impact of so-called Superfund sites, hazardous waste sites that are especially prevalent in Booker’s home state, and usually located in the same neighborhoods as low-income residents, often African American or Hispanic. In an April 29 interview with MSNBC, Booker cast that issue not only as a challenge for social justice and equality but also as a public health problem. ""We now have longitudinal data that shows that children born around Superfund sites have dramatically higher rates of birth defects, dramatically higher rates of autism,"" he said. This isn’t the first time Booker has made this argument, and it likely won’t be the last. So, we decided to dig in and see how it stands up to scrutiny. First, the data Booker’s press team sent us two Superfund studies: a 2008 paper on the association between toxic landfills and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and a 2011 study probing that association regarding congenital anomalies (the ""birth defects"" Booker mentioned). In the autism paper, researchers mapped the location of New Jersey Superfund sites and almost 500 children diagnosed with ASD from 1998 to 2006, finding that cases appeared in higher frequency closer to the sites. Those researchers also checked for a relationship between higher numbers of Superfund sites in a state and frequency of ASDs. That analysis ""reveal[ed] considerable overlap"" between high Superfund rates and autism diagnoses — though the authors were quick to caution that a correlation didn’t mean one caused the other. The 2014 paper looked at births from 1989 to 2003, near Superfund sites in Florida, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Texas — all of which were cleaned up at some point in that time frame. Before a site was cleaned up, infants were, on average, 20% to 25% more likely to have a congenital birth defect. ""This does suggest that the Superfund sites caused birth defects,"" argued Janet Currie, a study author and professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University, in an email to KHN. Both of these are longitudinal studies, meaning the research was collected over time to track patterns and changes.   Booker’s phrasing is quite deliberate – and that matters for his case We spoke to environmental health researchers unaffiliated with the studies. They said it would be very difficult to prove that being born near a Superfund site causes kids to be born with birth defects, or causes autism. It helps that in his statements Booker doesn’t try to make that case. One caveat, though, is that a casual listener could draw that conclusion. The studies he’s working with are ""fairly exploratory,"" said David Savitz, a professor of epidemiology at Brown University’s School of Public Health. While they support the idea of a link between autism and Superfund sites, or birth defects and such sites, they don’t go so far as to support a case for causality. Other factors could contribute, too. ""It’s not hard to imagine all the ways the communities proximal to waste sites may be different — a lot of ways other than just having the waste site,"" Savitz said. But Booker’s comments are rooted in legitimate data sources. Both those studies are peer-reviewed and suggest there could be some kind of relationship. So, the center of his claim — there is data that shows children near Superfund sites having higher rates of congenital abnormalities and autism — does, in fact, check out. Even so, environmental health experts said, much more work is needed to understand the nature of that claim. Risk factors for autism are still not well-identified. And congenital abnormalities can refer to a range of different problems — so research that lumps them together may gloss over important distinctions, especially when it comes to what might cause a specific birth defect. The bigger picture Booker is getting at a larger truth: Many chemicals found at Superfund sites are related to health problems, the experts said. And, those same experts added, his environmental justice framing is one that makes sense, too, given the demographics of those most often affected. From a policy standpoint, Savitz argued, Booker’s bigger point — that cleaning up Superfunds would improve health outcomes, in particular for marginalized people — is clearly true. The only real issue, some suggested, is his use of the word ""dramatically."" The data suggests potential correlation, but whether it’s ""dramatic"" is far from clear. ""Certainly there is evidence to back up his claim,"" said Amanda Bakian, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Utah, who studies environmental contributors to autism risk. ""There’s been work finding an association, but the relationship is modest. … We do need more research in this area."" Our rating Booker is correct in saying data shows that children born near Superfund sites have higher rates of birth defects and autism. In this statement, he doesn’t specifically say there is a causal relationship — which is important, because the data does not necessarily say Superfund proximity causes those issues, and more research would be needed to support that claim.   The use of the word ""dramatically"" causes a bit of trouble, however. The datasets show statistically significant correlations. But that isn’t the same thing as a ""dramatically higher rate."" The statement is true, but could use more context",Mostly True,"May 1, 2019"
"""All the ponds in Missouri for which we have data are causing groundwater contamination. … This is a statewide issue.""","In a Feb. 24 article published by St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Maxine Lipeles, director of Washington University’s Interdisciplinary Environmental Clinic, made a jarring statement about the condition of Missouri’s groundwater as a result of coal ash contamination. ""All the ponds in Missouri for which we have data are causing groundwater contamination...This is a statewide issue,"" Lipeles said. Lipeles is specifically referencing coal ash ponds, engineered ponds used for the disposal of coal ash waste, in her statement. Lipeles was responding to an effort by the Missouri legislature to shift oversight of coal ash disposal from the federal level to the state level. According to the Energy Information Administration, coal fueled 81 percent of Missouri's electricity generation in 2017, and more coal is consumed for electricity generation in Missouri than in all but two other states. Coal ash is the resulting waste when coal is burned for electricity. Currently, there are 16 coal-fired power plants and 41 coal ash ponds in Missouri, according to a 2019 Washington University Law report. Lipeles’ statement may have you second-guessing yourself anytime you reach for your kitchen faucet. We checked Lipeles’ claim to see if it, in fact, holds water. We reached out to Lipeles to understand the data on which her statement was founded on. Lieples directed us to the utilities’ 2017 annual groundwater monitoring reports to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from January 2018. The utilities are required by the EPA to report groundwater monitoring data each year. The EPA first required the reports beginning in 2017. The 2018 reports were recently added, but Lipeles told us she has not reviewed the latest reports. The EPA also required that plants share their coal combustion residuals, as required by the Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals Rule of 2015. The EPA’s list was last updated on May 15, 2018. Upon examination of the reports posted on EPA’s list, we found that every groundwater monitoring report posted for every utility company did appear to show the presence of at least one contaminant. The reports often emphasize corrective action plans and also try to prove that an extraneous source could be causing the groundwater contamination. We reached out to Patricia Schuba, president of the Labadie Environmental Organization and a trained biologist, for a second opinion on Lipeles’ claim. ""It's a truthful statement that every [plant] that has to report under the coal ash rule for Missouri shows contamination,"" Schuba said. ""I think there's only a few that there's one contaminant, but arsenic stands out as the primary contaminant that's showing up in Missouri testing as well as molybdenum."" Schuba also stressed the risk of groundwater contamination beyond drinking water. ""There's this big concern that we don't realize that this stuff is so dangerous and we're putting it in a water environment where it can become soluble and move into plants, animals, fish...it can bioaccumulate in the rivers,"" Schuba said. ""It is contaminating a huge economic resource for the state, and I think the risk of that is totally underappreciated."" Abel Russ, a senior attorney for the Environmental Integrity Project, also agreed with Lipeles’ claim. Having formerly worked in the field of human health risk assessment as a research associate and toxicologist, Russ provided us with an 80-page report that included evaluations for groundwater contaminant present at every power plant in Missouri that provided groundwater monitoring data in March 2018 according to the Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals Rule of 2015. ""We were trying to determine whether each location had unsafe levels of groundwater contamination that could be attributed to regulated coal ash ponds or landfills,"" Russ said via email. ""Specifically, we counted a pollutant as being present at unsafe levels if (a) it exceeded health-based standards, and (b) the levels in downgradient wells were equal to or greater than the levels in upgradient wells."" According to the report, the only plant in Missouri that didn’t clearly appear to be causing groundwater contamination was the Sikeston power plant. ""For Sikeston, however, I should note that there are elevated levels of coal ash indicator pollutants like boron and sulfate in wells downgradient of the ash pond,"" Russ said. ""This tells me that the Sikeston ash pond is leaking. We didn’t flag it in our report because the levels in groundwater, even though they are elevated above background, do not exceed health-based standards."" For final confirmation, we did an online search to find documents that could add support for Lipeles’ claim. After reviewing the 2019 Washington University Law report on coal ash ponds, the data clearly supports her claim that ""all the ponds in Missouri for which we have data are causing groundwater contamination."" Sixteen Missouri coal-fired power plants were included in the report, analyzing a total of 41 coal ash ponds. For every plant listed, their respective coal ash ponds showed groundwater samples that exceeded the federal drinking water standards for boron, arsenic and/or sulfate. The only coal ash ponds included in the report that did not show groundwater contamination were those operated by plants that did not have groundwater monitoring data listed on their CCR compliance website. Those plants include but aren’t limited to Columbia Municipal Power Plant, Missouri City Generating Station and Blue Valley Generating Station. It should be noted that some plants that haven’t listed groundwater monitoring data on their CCR compliance website have coal ash ponds that have been closed and are currently inactive. However, the closure of a coal ash pond does not always mean that it has been decontaminated. Lipeles’ said every Missouri coal ash pond for which there is data is causing groundwater contamination. After analyzing, Washington University’s data and the utility reports listed by the EPA, every coal ash pond in Missouri that has published data is either causing at least one type of chemical contamination for groundwater or showing signs that it has potential to cause contamination in the near future",True,"April 26, 2019"

"Quotes Thomas Homer-Dixon as saying a windmill will ""never generate as much energy as was invested building it.""","The subject of windmills seems to be pretty popular these days. It started with the president when he made the Mostly False statement in March that wind turbine-powered electricity stops when the wind does. A month later, Trump waded in further to make the Pants on Fire claim that windmills cause cancer. Now, we have a meme roaming social media that claims Canadian author and professor Thomas Homer-Dixon said that windmills will ""never"" generate as much energy as was expended to build the structures. The full quote: ""A two-megawatt windmill contains 260 tonnes of steel requiring 170 tonnes of coking coal and 300 tonnes of iron ore, all mined, transported and produced by hydrocarbons.""

The meme was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It actually dates back to 2015, but continues to surface on social media. No, Homer-Dixon did not say or write this. The phrase is a partial quote cherry-picked from a chapter written by earth scientist David Hughes in the 2009 book ""Carbon Shift: How Peak Oil and the Climate Crisis Will Change Canada (and Our Lives),"" a book Homer-Dixon edited. Here is the full passage: ""The concept of net energy must also be applied to renewable sources of energy, such as windmills and photovoltaics. A two-megawatt windmill contains 260 tonnes of steel requiring 170 tonnes of coking coal and 300 tonnes of iron ore, all mined, transported and produced by hydrocarbons. The question is: how long must a windmill generate energy before it creates more energy than it took to build it? At a good wind site, the energy payback day could be in three years or less; in a poor location, energy payback may be never. That is, a windmill could spin until it falls apart and never generate as much energy as was invested in building it."" The meme does get a part of the quote right, but it strategically leaves out large swaths of information in order to give people the impression that all windmills never expend the amount of energy that was invested in it, which is not accurate. The meme’s omitted section explains that, while poorly placed windmills may never generate enough energy payback, a good wind site could generate it in three years or less. Homer-Dixon, who served as the founding director of the Waterloo Institute for Complexity and Innovation and is currently a professor at the Balsillie School of International Affairs, even called out the meme in a May 2018 post on his website. ""It’s worth noting that it would be pointless to put wind turbines in poor locations, and it’s trivial, or meaningless, to say that a turbine would never pay back its embedded energy in a poor location,"" Homer-Dixon wrote in the post.

"""The day Al Gore was born, there were 130,000 glaciers on earth.

The 2006 movie ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" for example, follows Gore as he discusses the dangers of global warming. A recent Facebook post seems to play on that film title with a claim about glaciers. ""The day Al Gore was born, there were 130,000 glaciers on earth,"" reads the text of a Facebook post featuring pictures of the veep. ""Today, only 130,000 remain."" ""Awkward,"" wrote the Facebook account that published the post on March 11. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We turned to research and climate scientists to help us figure out if it’s accurate. What’s a glacier?  A glacier is a body of snow and ice that’s big enough in size and mass to move under its own weight, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. But what qualifies as a glacier depends on who you ask. The USGS defines them ""according to the commonly accepted guidelines in which a body of ice has an area of at least 0.1 kilometers squared, or about 25 acres."" But that’s not universal. Over in Argentina, for example, a grassroots group challenged the size cutoff for a glacier to be included in the country’s national inventory, arguing it has imperiled important water sources. And a recent study in the journal Nature discusses sea level rise from uncharted glaciers, ones that disappeared before they were documented or are ""missing,"" meaning they’re too small to be included in inventories. William Colgan, a senior researcher with the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, told PolitiFact that the emerging global standard for defining a glacier is a minimum of 1 hectare, or 100 meters by 100 meters. How many glaciers were there in 1948? According to Colgan, we don’t know what the global number of glaciers was in 1948, the year Al Gore was born. Scientists use satellites to map glaciers and reliable satellite monitoring didn’t start until the mid 1980s. ""We just don’t have the snapshots from space in 1948,"" Colgan said. How many glaciers are there today? We do have estimates of the total number of glaciers today. According to the Randolph Glacier Inventory, Colgan said, there are 197,654 glaciers that are at least 1 hectare, or 0.01 square kilometers. That’s 67,654 more than the Facebook post says, not counting the thousands of ""missing"" glaciers, Colgan said. Walt Meier, a research scientist with the National Snow and Ice Data Center, told PolitiFact that inventories are always changing. The numbers could increase because more glaciers are getting mapped, he said. One database on the center’s website lists 306,865 glaciers, for example. Michael Kemp, director of the World Glacier Monitoring Service, cited 215,000 glaciers today. He said in an email that the number 130,000 probably comes from the World Glacier Inventory, which is a snapshot of the glacier distribution in the second half of the 20th century. But, Kemp said, it’s not globally complete. How have glaciers changed over the decades?  Kemp said that though it’s clear glaciers have been shrinking worldwide since the mid 19th century, the number of glaciers may not have changed much. That’s because while some glaciers have vanished altogether, others have ""disintegrated from one large glacier complex into smaller tributary glaciers."" Jim White, a climate scientist and interim dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder, said a better measure of glacier change is ice volume, because that translates to potential sea level rise if that ice melts. ""Satellites give us area, not volume, so numbers of glaciers is interesting but volume change is more important for Miami,"" he said. (The coastal city is vulnerable to sea level rise.) How much ice have we lost since Al Gore was born?  Citing a 2017 Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme study Colgan worked on, he said the world has lost about 33,000 gigatons of ice since 1948. To put a gigaton in perspective, scientists estimate we’re losing 159 gigatons of ice from Antarctica each year, according to the Washington Post. That’s about a third of all the water in Lake Erie. ""The changes are so great with land ice, it’s like the poster child of climate change,"" Colgan said. ""Everywhere you look, you see massive change."" Consider Glacier National Park, in Montana. In an undated post about the park, the U.S. Geological Survey says there were an estimated approximate 150 glaciers in 1850. Most of those glaciers were still there when the park was established in 1910. But by 2015, there were 26 remaining glaciers larger than 25 acres. Glaciers are dynamic. They respond to temperature and precipitation. But they retreat when melting outpaces the accumulation of new snow. And, USGS notes, ""worldwide glacial glacier recession is well documented."" ""Early park visitors and scientists noted that glaciers were retreating as early as 1914,"" according to the post. ""The climate was already warming and glaciers were responding, but the industrial revolution added more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, furthering glacier retreat."" All glaciers have reduced in size in the park since 1966, according to USGS, and some had retreated as much 85 percent by 2015. (You can see photos showing how the Shepard Glacier in the park has changed from 1913 to 2005.) Our ruling The Facebook post claims that there were 130,000 glaciers in 1948 and there are 130,000 glaciers today. We don’t know how many glaciers there were in 1948, and there are actually tens of thousands more glaciers worldwide today than the post says. But context matters here, and the post suggests that glaciers haven’t changed in the 70 years since Al Gore was born. That’s also incorrect. As Walt Meier, the research scientist with the National Snow and Ice Data Center, told us, ""the number of glaciers isn’t really relevant in terms of assessing climate change."" What matters, he said, is the change in mass. ""Are glaciers as a whole gaining or losing ice?"" he asked. ""On that question, the answer is very clear — glaciers are losing mass",False,"April 2, 2019"
"Bluegill fish ""are responsible for over 500 deaths in the United States every summer.""","As spring turns to summer, should you be wary of death-by-bluegill fish as you step into the water to cool off?

""The Bluegill fish is one of the most dangerous fish in North America,"" the March 28 post claims. ""The bluegill is related to the deadly piranna (sic) which is responsible for 20,000 deaths per year.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Let’s look at whether bluegills are responsible for more than 500 human deaths in the United States every summer. The fish doesn’t show up on Britannica’s list of 10 of the most dangerous fish in the world, though the piranha (spelled correctly) ranks fourth. The bluegill, meanwhile, is one of the most popular sport fish in the United States, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The fish’s range spans North America, from Canada to northern Mexico, and they like quiet streams, ponds, lagoons and small- to medium-sized lakes. Their diet? Insects, insect larvae, small crustaceans and worms. (No humans listed.) We couldn’t find any credible evidence that bluegill fish prey on people, not to mention kill hundreds of them every year. Rather, news coverage of the fish is positive, and it doesn’t suggest that we should fear the bluegill.

"""President Trump signed legislation to clean up millions of tons of trash from our oceans and lakes last week.""","Between the Mueller report and efforts to undo the Affordable Care Act, is President Donald Trump taking on marine trash?

""But the media won’t report on that… ever."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We’ve checked a similar claim before. In late January, an article posted to Facebook claimed that Trump had signed a bill ""to clean millions of tons of garbage from the world’s oceans."" The story was referring to the Save Our Seas Act of 2018, which Trump signed on Oct. 11. He then said that more than 8 million tons of garbage is dumped into oceans every year and that the law ""will help address this problem."" But Jordana Merran, communications manager for Ocean Conservancy, a nonprofit that supported the Save Our Seas Act and celebrated its passage, said it’s not accurate to summarize the legislation as a bill to ""clean millions of tons of garbage from the world’s oceans."" Rather, the law Trump signed reauthorizes ""the longstanding amount of $10 million annually"" for NOAA’s Marine Debris Program, she said. ""The program does support, among other efforts, Ocean Conservancy’s International Coastal Cleanup, in which volunteers collect millions of pounds of garbage off beaches and waterways annually across the globe. However, many entities provide financial support for the ICC."" The legislation, which was sponsored by U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, and cosponsored by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, had bipartisan support. It doesn’t direct the country to clean millions of tons of garbage from marine environments. The bill reauthorizes and amends the Marine Debris Act ""to promote international action to reduce marine debris, and for other purposes,"" according to the law. But it’s not specific about how much debris, or how it should be cleaned up. Did Trump sign another bill earlier in March?

"""We have flown a Boeing 737 across the Atlantic Ocean on biofuels. We have flown F-18s.""","Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who’s made climate change the centerpiece of his 2020 Democratic presidential run, said he would use the U.S. military’s vast purchasing power to promote clean energy. Asked in an interview what the Inslee administration would do about global warming in the first 100 days, Inslee said he would make the Pentagon’s budget more eco-friendly, and argued that elements of that concept have already been shown to work. ""We have flown a Boeing 737 across the Atlantic Ocean on biofuels. We have flown F-18s,"" Inslee told Vox. ""So we can use the procurement power of the United States military to drive some of this clean energy."" Inslee was right about biofuels having powered a supersonic jet. We also found that aircraft similar to the 737 completed transatlantic flights on blended fuel, though we didn’t find instances where 737s had done so. Inslee is correct that the U.S. military has flown an F-18 on biofuel. Navy aviators made history in 2010 by flying an F-18 Super Hornet on a 50-50 blend of conventional jet fuel and biofuel—the first time this was attempted in a supersonic jet, according to the Washington Examiner. The 45-minute test flight took place on Earth Day at a Maryland naval base, the Navy’s media wing reported. The biofuel was derived from a plant called camelina, which is native to North America. Prior to the test flight, the Navy said, the Pentagon awarded a $2.7 million contract to a Montana-based renewable fuel company for 40,000 gallons of camelina-based fuel. The environmentally-friendly moves were part of then-Navy Secretary Ray Mabus’s initiative— known as the Great Green Fleet—a $510 million, three-year program to explore cleaner energy options. Under the program, the Navy certified warships and aircraft to operate on biofuels. But according to Todd Harrison, the director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, naval systems do not routinely use biofuels due to their high cost. Harrison seemed skeptical that the military would embrace a dramatic shift to the alternative energy source. ""It is possible that if the Navy started making regular, large-scale purchases of biofuels for its systems that it could help jump start this industry and bring down the price for other consumers,"" Harrison added. ""But that would be a significant investment on the part of the Navy for something that only tangentially benefits the military."" Mabus, for his part, told us he sees climate change and national security as inextricably linked. He argued that as one of the biggest energy consumers on the planet, the Defense Department’s role in combating climate change should not be overlooked. Bottom line: Inslee is right that F-18s have flown on biofuels. But what to make of his claim about 737s? Inslee didn’t specify who he claims flew a Boeing 737 across the Atlantic—and a Navy spokesman said that service branch had never flown this series aircraft on biofuels. We reached out to Inslee’s campaign, and they pointed us to a Boeing press release that described the company’s development of a fuel that blended petroleum fuel and ""bio-derived oils and waste animal fats."" The press release also mentions Boeing’s work with Virgin Atlantic on a 2008 bio-fueled test flight. But it doesn’t say anything about flying a 737 across the Atlantic Ocean on biofuels. (We reached out to Boeing directly but didn’t hear back.) That said, we did find numerous examples of transatlantic flights powered by biofuels. Boeing posted a clip on YouTube in 2011 of a 747-8 Freighter completing what the plane maker described as ""the first-ever transatlantic biofuel flight with a commercial jetliner."" A Lufthansa 747 made the first biofuel-powered transatlantic commercial flight to the United States in 2012, and two years later Finnair used a cooking oil-based biofuel to fly an Airbus A330 from Helsinki to New York. In 2018, United Airlines celebrated the ""longest transatlantic biofuel flight to date"" when a 787 Dreamliner flew from San Francisco to Zurich. Inslee said, ""We have flown a Boeing 737 across the Atlantic Ocean on biofuels. We have flown F-18s."" The Navy made history in 2010 when it flew an F-18 supersonic jet on biofuels. We found numerous transatlantic flights that have been powered by biofuels, too. We weren’t able to find instances where Boeing 737s had done so, but those are similar to other aircraft we documented",Mostly True,"March 21, 2019"
"""Seismic airgun blasting (used for energy exploration) is ... 16,000 times louder than"" a conventional airhorn.","If a picture is worth a thousand words, Rep. Joe Cunningham, D-S.C., may have proved that a one-second blast of sound is worth 2,000. At a March 7 U.S. House hearing about threats to whales posed by energy exploration, Cunningham pulled out an airhorn and, with permission, pulled the trigger. Cunningham's show-and-tell went viral. ""Was that disruptive?"" Cunningham asked Chris Oliver from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In November, the agency gave five companies permission to use high-powered acoustic seismic survey tools to scout for oil and gas pockets off the Atlantic coast from Delaware to Florida. Cunningham wanted to illustrate what high-powered means. ""It was irritating, but I didn't find it particularly disruptive,"" Oliver replied. Cunningham then pressed Oliver to compare the noise of the airhorn to the seismic airgun arrays used by the survey ships. Cunningham: ""How much louder do you think seismic airgun blasting sounds then this airhorn you just heard?"" Oliver: ""I honestly don't know."" Cunningham: ""Take a guess. Ten times?"" Oliver: ""At a distance of how far?"" Cunningham: ""Well, say say you're within a reasonable distance, say within a quarter-mile. Is it 10 times? 25 times?"" Oliver: ""I honestly don't know."" Cunningham: ""I mean, can you take a guess."" Oliver: ""No."" Cunningham: ""A hundred times? You think it's a thousand times times louder ? Oliver: ""I doubt it."" Cunningham: ""You doubt it. What if I were tell you it's 16,000 times louder than what you just heard here?"" Oliver wasn’t the only person surprised to hear that a seismic airgun array is 16,000 times louder than an airhorn. We decided to see if the number holds up. • In an apples-to-apples comparison of decibel levels, the seismic arrays emit sound waves that range from 19,000 to 10 million times more intense than Cunningham’s airhorn. • Short of the point where the force of sound waves blows out your eardrums or causes other physical harm, loudness is more a matter of human perception, rather than a measurable quantity that applies across species. • Comparing decibels, instead of loudness, is the approach marine biologists use. Oil and gas companies can get an idea of where to drill in the ocean by using ships that send sound waves toward the ocean floor and pick up the echoes to see what’s underneath. This government diagram shows the basic process:  Source: Bureau of Ocean Energy Management The airguns release a burst of high-pressure air into the water. The rippling bubble creates the sound waves. Notice that some of the sound waves head straight down and some head off at an angle. The way the arrays work, the more a sound wave deviates from straight down, the lower the decibel level. We factored that in when we ran the numbers below. Just before Donald Trump took office, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management cancelled permit applications for seismic surveys in the mid and south Atlantic coastal waters. The agency wrote the value of the surveys ""does not outweigh the potential risks of those surveys’ acoustic pulse impacts on marine life."" When Donald Trump became president, the government reversed course. At the end of November 2018, the permit applications cleared a key hurdle. Many coastal communities oppose drilling for fear of harm to the environment and tourism industry. Seeing seismic surveys as the first step before any wells are sunk, South Carolina and 16 municipalities — Cunningham represents several of them  — have sued the federal government to block both the surveys and offshore rigs. One of the arguments against the surveys is that they threaten marine ecosystems and the animals that live in them. The North Atlantic right whale is particularly vulnerable. Only 411 survive, about a 15 percent decline in eight years. The factors driving their decline are numerous. They include being vulnerable to disease; sustaining wounds from passing ships; and dying as calves after losing the care of their mothers. The sounds from the seismic airguns have been linked to killing the krill the whales feed on and causing breakdowns in the whales’ ability to communicate. Scott Kraus, senior science advisor at the New England Aquarium, who testified at the House hearing, told us that the low frequency sounds used in the surveys are particularly troubling. ""Low frequencies travel far with little attenuation, so seismic noise goes for hundreds of kilometers,"" Kraus said. ""Nearly all baleen whale communication occurs in the lower frequency bands, hence the concerns over disturbance, displacement, and cow/calf separations at great distances."" The government imposes a number of restrictions to minimize the impact on marine life. Scientists such as Kraus say those restrictions are wholly insufficient, given the intensity of the seismic surveys and the way sound travels through the ocean. Cunningham said seismic airgun blasting was 16,000 times louder than his airhorn. For context, an ordinary conversation is about 60 decibels (dB). A garbage disposal working hard is 80 dB. A jet taking off is about 140 dB. Cunningham's airhorn comes in at 120 dB. Cunningham's big number basically checks out, but there are issues. First off, loudness is subjective. Humans process sound one way, and whales, well, ""actually, we do not know about large whale perceptions of loudness,"" said Christopher Clark, a Cornell research professor, who specializes in whale acoustics and testified against the seismic surveys at the hearing. ""As bioacousticians working with animals, in this case whales, we do not talk about loudness, we use sound level in decibels."" Second, Cunninham's staff took the 120 dB blast of the airhorn and the maximum level of 260 dB for a seismic airgun and subtracted to find the difference. The problem is, one was measured on land and the other in the ocean. ""Comparing a sound in air with one in water, although based on a genuine interest in getting this loudness difference idea across to the public, is misdirected,"" Clark said. ""The way sound intensity is measured in air is not the same as the way sound intensity is measured in water."" Rebecca Drago, Cunningham’s spokeswoman, said he wasn’t aiming for technical accuracy. ""He wanted to illustrate to the people there in the room what this really loud sound would feel like,"" Drago said. ""Using decibels isn’t really effective for people to understand."" Fortunately, there's a simple conversion (abut 62 dB) to compare air and water decibel readings. On an apples-to-apples basis, we calculated the decibel level difference between Cunningham’s airhorn and the seismic airgun arrays. We corrected for the air-water factor, and we used three decibel levels for the airgun arrays, based on numbers from the NOAA Fisheries environmental assessment report, discussions with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and an independent analysis of seismic surveys. There are more than three levels, but we selected a range from high to low. The bureau used 230 dB in its environmental impact statement. The table’s lowest decibel level for an array corresponds to the steepest angle away from straight down under the ship. How much difference that actually makes for the whales and other ocean animals is a matter of debate. For this fact-check, it is enough to say that at the low end, an airgun array can be 19,000 times more intense than an airhorn. That is a little bit more than the 16,000-fold difference Cunningham said. Given the way the decibel system works (it’s logarithmic), a 60 dB change is a million times more intense, and a 70 dB change is 10 million times greater. At those levels, Cunningham greatly understated the acoustic difference between his airhorn and seismic airgun arrays. To be sure, sound in water has many nuances and it’s possible that a level less than 225 dB could be recorded. But the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management told us this is ""approximately"" the range they use, and we found no lower figure. Cunningham said that seismic airgun blasting ""is 16,000 times louder"" than an airhorn. We don't know exactly how whales process sounds, so louder is not the right term. But decibel levels can be compared. Given the range of decibel levels from the seismic arrays, Cunningham is pretty much on the money at the low end of the readings. Above that, Cunningham greatly understated the difference. His statement is largely correct, but it needs some additional context",Mostly True,"March 15, 2019"
"""At $93 trillion, the Green New Deal would cost more than the entire recorded spending of the U.S. since the Constitution went into effect in 1789.""","The Green New Deal — a bold, thinly detailed climate change-centered plan from U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez — has drawn heated reactions from Republicans, including U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa. When Ernst spoke against the New York Democrat’s proposal during a Senate session, she called it a ""raw deal."" And she made a provocative claim by displaying a large poster that read: ""At $93 trillion, the Green New Deal would cost more than the entire recorded spending of the U.S. since the Constitution went into effect in 1789."" At $93 trillion, Ernst’s claim uses a colossal figure. But it’s only about as strong as a clothespin in high wind. Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal is a House resolution — that is, a non-binding measure and not actual legislation. There’s also a companion measure in the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in early March that the Senate would vote on the Green New Deal in the coming weeks.

Broadly speaking, the resolutions address ways to curb climate change and protect the environment. The House version has far-reaching environmental goals, including ""eliminating pollution and greenhouse gas emissions as much as technologically feasible."" And it reaches into other domestic policy areas, as well. But the proposal doesn’t lay out any cost figures. And it has not received a cost estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office — the gold-standard source on such estimates. To back Ernst’s $93 trillion claim — a figure that spans 10 years — her office pointed us to a report on the Green New Deal by the American Action Forum, which describes itself as a center-right think tank. The forum is a sister organization of the American Action Network, a conservative, nonprofit advocacy organization. Interestingly, the report does not state its bottom-line estimate of what the Green New Deal would cost. But if you add up the various figures, the cost is pegged at somewhere between $51 trillion and $93 trillion. So, Ernst is wrong when she flatly states that the Green New Deal will cost $93 trillion. By far, the largest expenses, as estimated by the American Action Forum, are for non-environmental parts of the proposal: $36 trillion for universal health care and up to to $44.6 trillion for guaranteed union jobs with a family-sustaining wage. The environmental costs include an estimated $5.4 trillion to transition to a ""low-carbon electricity grid."" But Ernst’s claim is even more misleading in that the report itself is full of assumptions, qualifiers and caveats. Indeed, the report starts with a caveat, saying the breadth of the Green New Deal’s proposals ""makes it daunting to assess"" using the ""standard tools of policy analysis. Nevertheless, this short paper is an initial foray."" And the report’s lead author, economist and American Action Forum president Douglas Holtz-Eakin, made it clear to us that the report aims to provide very rough estimates on a plan that’s only partially developed. ""It’s important to distinguish whether it’s tens of millions, tens of billions of dollars or tens of trillions of dollars,"" he said. ""That’s the important information."" Politico goes so far as to call the $93 trillion ""bogus."" But Holtz-Eakin’s work has held up to scrutiny before. He was the director of the Congressional Budget Office from 2003 to 2005 under President George W. Bush. According to the New York Times, he was often ""a thorn in the side of the Bush administration."" And Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told us the American Action Forum report is ""a perfectly reasonable paper"" for what it is —putting an ""order of magnitude,"" rough cost estimate on a bare-bones proposal. As for the rest of Ernst’s claim — that $93 trillion is ""more than the entire recorded spending of the U.S. since the Constitution went into effect in 1789"" — Ernst’s office said historical tables from the fiscal 2019 federal budget show total federal spending is $83 trillion since 1789. Holtz-Eakin told us he had not seen such a figure calculated. But both Holtz-Eakin and Gleckman told us Ernst's methodology doesn’t take into account 230 years of inflation, population growth and economic growth. Ernst says: ""At $93 trillion, the Green New Deal would cost more than the entire recorded spending of the U.S. since the Constitution went into effect in 1789."" A center-right think tank run by the former head of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget office estimates the cost of the Green New Deal, over 10 years, at between $51 trillion and $93 trillion. But the report itself described the estimates as an ""initial foray,"" filled with assumptions and caveats about a thinly detailed plan. No official government cost estimate has been done. And even if the high-end estimate of $93 trillion were accurate, comparing it with total federal spending since the Constitution is problematic, to say the least. Simply adding up federal spending, as Ernst did, doesn't take into account either inflation or population growth. Ernst's statement simply goes way too far",False,"March 12, 2019"
"""The forest fires were so grotesque last year that we had the worst air in the world in Washington.""","Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, one of the Democrats running for president in 2020, has made climate change the centerpiece of his days-old campaign. Shortly before making his run official, he discussed the importance of climate change in an interview and made this claim about the impact of fires on his state: ""The forest fires were so grotesque last year that we had the worst air in the world in Washington. We were choking. It’s a very personal thing for me."" A couple of days after launching his campaign, Inslee repeated the worst-air claim during another discussion about climate change. We wanted to know whether Washington really had worse air quality than in India or China in 2018. We also wanted to explore how much climate change had to do with it. As smoke from wildfires blanketed the area during the summer of 2018, Seattle news reports said Seattle had the worst air quality in the world on Aug. 21, 2018. The reports cited rankings that day from AirVisual, an air monitoring service. AirVisual spokeswoman Kelsey Duska told us that during at least some points of that day, Seattle had the worst air among 85 cities, generally with a population of more than 400,000, around the world. Washington fared a little better in a broader set of monitoring done by AirVisual. Duska said that for the entire month of August 2018, the air in Chelan, Wash., about 180 miles east of Seattle, ranked fifth-worst among 3,000 cities worldwide. Rob Jackson, a Stanford University earth system science professor, told us that AirVisual’s numbers are reliable. So, Inslee’s worst-air claim is correct — for one day of the year. As for Inslee’s larger point, experts told us that climate change played a role in making the wildfires, and thus air quality, worse, but that other factors did, too. Inslee’s campaign pointed us to an article posted on National Public Radio’s website in the wake of the news reports about Seattle’s worst-air ranking. It carried this headline: ""Why Seattle had the worst air quality in the world at some points this summer."" The article was a transcript of an interview with Cliff Mass, professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington. Maas said Seattle had had the worst air in 20 years — to the point that mountains and water around the city were not visible. Asked why the air was so bad, Mass cited the wildfires, adding that ""we had an atmospheric circulation that took the smoke directly from these nearby fires right over Seattle."" And Mass said he suspects that it would happen again in the future — but he pointed to forests, not climate change. ""Well, the big problem is our forests. We've suppressed fire now for almost a century,"" he said. ""A lot of the forests surrounding Seattle are in very bad condition. They're overgrown. They have a lot of slash, a lot of low bushes and trees. And they're completely unlike the forests that were here 150 years ago. And the problem is when they burn, they burn catastrophically. ""The question is how much of this is climate change. I suspect that only a small proportion of this is climate change. I think that the main problem is the forests, which are ready to burn. We have invasive grasses that have moved in that burn very easily. And human beings are increasingly starting fires with this huge number of people going in for recreation, other uses of the forested areas,"" he said.

""Now, on the long term, as the planet warms up, we certainly would expect more fires. So climate change, global warming probably contributed a small amount to it, but probably the key thing is what we've done to the surface of the planet."" Other experts gave more weight to the role of climate change. Stanford’s Jackson and John Reilly, co-director of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change at MIT, told us that climate change clearly is one factor in making the wildfires, and in turn air quality, worse. But they agreed that other factors, such as fire suppression, have also made the wildfires worse. Finally, Inslee’s campaign also pointed us to two other articles about wildfires and climate change: McClatchy news service reported on a federal study in November 2018 that said, ""California and the West have already witnessed an expansion of catastrophic blazes due to climate change and rising warming, with twice as much acreage burned by wildfire than would have occurred otherwise."" And Scientific American reported on an academic study that, according to the magazine, found that climate change not only is increasing the likelihood of wildfires, the ""wildfires are causing a spike in air pollution across the West.""   However, Daniel Jaffe, a University of Washington professor of environmental chemistry, said in that article that while climate change makes wildfires worse, so does forest management. In discussing climate change, Inslee said, ""The forest fires were so grotesque last year that we had the worst air in the world in Washington."" By one measure, of 85 major cities across the globe, Seattle had the worst air quality in the world on Aug. 21, 2018, as wildfires pushed smoke into the area. That was for one day of the year. Experts said climate change is one factor in making the forest fires, and in turn air quality, worse; but other factors, such as fire suppression practices, have also made the fires worse",True,"March 8, 2019"
"The Democrats’ Green New Deal includes ""working towards ending air travel.""","After U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., unveiled the Green New Deal, Republican critics said it would eventually ground air travel. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., outlined his opposition to the Democrats’ Green New Deal in a Feb. 25th Orlando Sentinel op-ed: ""If you are not familiar with it, here’s the cliff notes version: It calls for rebuilding or retrofitting every building in America in the next 10 years, eliminating all fossil fuels in 10 years, eliminating nuclear power, and working towards ending air travel (to be replaced with high-speed rail)."" Scott described mayhem if a Democrat wins the presidency; some 2020 presidential candidates are co-sponsors of the Green New Deal. ""What then? Tear down all buildings, eliminate oil and gas, and stop air travel?"" Let’s hit the brakes right there -- do the Democrats want to end air travel?  We found that Scott is ignoring the actual text of the resolution. The resolution does not ground airplanes, either now or in the future. And climate advocates told us the elimination of air travel isn’t a practical goal. The ""Green New Deal,"" resolution was introduced by Ocasio-Cortez on Feb. 7 and has 89 Democratic co-sponsors. A companion measure in the Senate, introduced by Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., has nearly a dozen sponsors -- all Democrats -- including presidential candidates Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Broadly, these resolutions address ways to curb climate change and protect the environment. Even if it were to pass both chambers, the resolution would be nonbinding. So what does the House resolution say about air travel? In a word, nothing. It makes no mention of airplanes at all. It does call for ""overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible,"" which includes ""investment in high-speed rail."" We reached out to Scott’s press office and did not hear back by deadline, but the senator was probably referring to some supporting documents released by Ocasio-Cortez’s staff. A frequently asked questions, or FAQ, document mentioned airplanes twice, stating (emphasis ours) ""we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast, but we think we can ramp up renewable manufacturing and power production, retrofit every building in America, build the smart grid, overhaul transportation and agriculture, plant lots of trees and restore our ecosystem to get to net-zero."" The FAQ also called for the United States to ""totally overhaul transportation by massively expanding electric vehicle manufacturing, build charging stations everywhere, build out high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary, create affordable public transit available to all, with goal to replace every combustion-engine vehicle."" (For the record, according to the UC Santa Barbara ScienceLine, ""cows do contribute to global warming, although in fact they mostly do so by burping rather than farting."") As soon as the the FAQ document became public, the idea that the Democrats wanted to make air travel obsolete was picked up by Fox News and some Republican politicians, including President Donald Trump. Ocasio-Cortez’s press office did not reply for this fact-check, but her chief of staff previously said that there were many shared documents among various interest groups, and that the release of this particular document was a mistake. Experts on climate change say it’s important to focus on the language in the actual resolution and not the FAQ, which carries no weight. ""It seems to me those lines from the FAQ were lighthearted and ill-considered, and it’s not clear why they were posted,"" said Sean Hecht, Co-Executive Director, Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at UCLA law school. Hecht noted that the FAQ doesn’t include any regulatory strategy to ban or even reduce air travel. ""It’s framed even in the FAQ as creating conditions where ‘air travel stops becoming necessary’ because alternatives are available -- not limiting or ending air travel,"" he said. David Weiskopf, climate policy director for NextGen Climate America, said the Green New Deal calls for a ""net-zero"" goal, which recognizes that emissions -- including from air travel -- won’t be eliminated in 10 years, so there would need to find negative emissions to balance them out. (NextGen Climate America was started by billionaire Tom Steyer. In 2018, the PAC supported Scott’s Democratic opponent, Bill Nelson.) ""The comment about cows and planes is not at all an expression of a policy goal to actually eliminate either. It is delivering information that some supporters may not want to hear -- that we will not zero out emissions completely, so we need some additional negative emissions -- expressed in what I take to be a colloquial tone that unfortunately left it open to misconstrual by critics,"" he said. ""No serious observer, supporter of the Green New Deal, climate scientist, or other climate advocate would take these statements as expressing a policy aim to eliminate cows or planes."" Air travel retains a unique role in moving people long distances. ""When people rank the difficulty of finding structural solutions to greenhouse gas emissions in various sectors, air travel is one of the hardest both technologically and practically, and there aren’t serious policy proposals yet that would solve the issue through limiting air travel or changing the energy sources for commercial aircraft on a significant scale,"" Hecht said. ""So it’s not a priority for policy."" Serious steps that the United States could take to reduce emissions from air travel emissions would include more efficient planes, more direct routes and alternative bio-based low-carbon fuels. In the long run, electric planes may be feasible, said Paul Bledsoe, a strategic advisor at the Progressive Policy Institute and a lecturer on environmental policy at American University. ""No serious climate experts advocate ending air travel -- that's simply a red-herring,"" said Bledsoe, who was a climate change advisor to the Clinton White House. Time to bring this fact-check in for a landing. Scott wrote in an op-ed that the Democrats’ Green New Deal includes ""working towards ending air travel."" The resolution makes no mention of ending air travel. Instead, it calls for ""overhauling transportation systems,"" which includes ""investment in high-speed rail."" Scott seized on a messaging document from Democrats that mentioned, perhaps in jest, getting rid of ""farting cows and airplanes."" But we found no evidence that getting rid of airplanes is a serious policy idea from climate advocates",False,"February 28, 2019"
"Says Hillary Clinton said, ""This planet might be able to support perhaps as many as half of a billion people who could live a sustainable life in relative comfort.

"""Our country has succeeded in reducing greenhouse emissions in previous years.""","Republican Rep. Morgan Griffith, who represents the 9th Congressional District in Southwest Virginia suffering from the decline of coal mining, recently derided Democratic resolutions to end greenhouse emissions in 10 years. The non-binding, identical, non-binding measures, called the ""Green New Deal,"" were introduced Feb. 7 in the House by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and in the Senate by Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass. Eighty Democrats have co-sponsored the resolutions, including six announced presidential candidates for 2020. The resolutions call for federal mobilization to curb climate change and protect the environment. They also broadly support Democratic aspirations to increase hourly wages, strengthen labor unions and make higher education accessible ""to all the people of the United States."" The measures don’t lay out specific programs to achieve the goals or revenues to finance them, other than saying the changes will pay for themselves. Griffith, in a Feb. 11 newsletter to constituents, said the environmental reforms were impractical, industry-killing and unnecessary. ""Our country has succeeded in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in previous years,"" he wrote. ""We did it with improved technology that increased energy efficiency and brought down the costs of cleaner fuel sources. This is the blueprint for a future that holds both cleaner air and water and greater prosperity."" We fact-checked Griffith’s claim that the U.S. has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions. Kevin Baird, Griffith’s communications director, told us the statement was based on data published by the Environmental Protection Agency in its ""Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gases and Sinks, 1990-2017."" It’s the latest edition of an annual report, released April 12, 2018. The report shows U.S. greenhouse emissions dropped from a peak 7,371 metric tons in 2007 to 6,472 metric tons in 2017 - the last year available. That’s an 11.8 percent decrease over the span, or an average 1.1 percent yearly decrease. The fall was not steady, however. During four years, emissions went up, during seven years, they went down. Much attention has been focused on the final three years of data. Emissions dropped by 2 percent in both 2015 and 2016, but only three-tenths of 1 percent in 2017. In other words, the rate of decrease was slowing. But there’s a problem: The EPA report Griffith sites is out of date. More recent research indicates greenhouse emissions rose in 2018. The research focuses on carbon dioxide discharges, which account for about 80 percent of greenhouse emissions. A report issued In January 2019 by the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm, estimated carbon emissions rose by 3.4 percent in in 2018 - the first increase in four years. That puts carbon emissions at about the same they were in the mid-1990s. The latest records from the Energy Information Administration, a data-collecting unit of the federal Energy Department, show carbon emissions for the first 10 months of 2018 were 3.2 percent higher than discharges during the first 10 months of 2017 Energy analysts generally attribute the slow overall decline in emissions from 2007 to 2017 to energy conservation caused by the Great Recession and its recovery, and the shift in electricity production from coal to natural gas, wind and solar power. On the other hand, Rhodium says the 2018 increase was largely caused by a booming economy that led to more emissions from factories, planes and trucks. Another factor was weather: A cold winter in parts of the country led to an increase in oil and gas consumption for heat. The EIA expects things to slow this year, predicting an 0.2 increase in carbon emissions. Rhodium said it doesn’t ""expect a repeat of 2018 this coming year."" Let’s to return to Griffith. It should be noted that some of the decrease in emissions that he lauds might not have happened if he had succeeded in his goal of reviving the coal industry. Our ruling ""Our country has succeeded in reducing greenhouse emissions in previous years,"" Griffith said in arguing against a Democratic resolution for an all-out effort to end the emissions in a decade. Griffith cites an EPA report released early last year showing emissions dropped 11.8 percent between 2007 and 2017. It went down three straight years between 2015 and 2017, although by declining amounts. But Griffith ignores more current research that alters his picture. The Rhodium Group estimates carbon emissions - the source of most greenhouse gases - increased by 3.4 percent last year. EIA data shows it went up 3.2 during the first 10 months of 2018, compared to the first 10 months of 2017. So you can argue this either way. During the last dozen years, emissions went up five times and down seven. On one hand, they're down 10 percent over the last 12 years; on the other, emissions are at the same level they were in the mid-1990s",Half True,"February 26, 2019"
"""More than a million Californians"" do not have ""clean water to bathe in or drink."""," Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has made confronting California’s contaminated drinking water a top priority early in his term in office. In his first week, he took his cabinet on a road trip to meet with Central Valley residents who, for years, have had to rely on bottled water for drinking and cooking. In his budget, he called for a tax on drinking water to help disadvantaged communities clean up contaminated water. Then he signed one of his first pieces of legislation to provide assistance to communities with unsafe water, including $10 million for emergency drinking water projects. During his State of the State Address, Newsom called California’s safe drinking water crisis ""a moral disgrace and a medical emergency."" He added this assertion: ""Just this morning, more than a million Californians woke up without clean water to bathe in or drink."" Is the problem this widespread? We decided to fact-check Newsom’s claim. Our research Clean drinking water advocates and researchers told us Newsom’s statement is correct, but noted it’s an estimate based on incomplete data, and that the actual number could be higher. ""It’s worse,"" said Jonathan London, a UC Davis professor who’s written about contaminated drinking water. The professor said one million would be ""an underestimate."" In the San Joaquin Valley alone, there were nearly 100,000 residents living without access to clean drinking water, according to a February 2018 UC Davis study London co-authored. ""Unfortunately, (Newsom’s) number is true,’ added Kelsey Hinton, spokesperson for the Community Water Center, a San Joaquin Valley nonprofit that advocates for clean drinking water. As evidence, both London and Hinton pointed to a 2017 drinking water compliance report by the State Water Resources Control Board, which regulates water quality. The report shows that an estimated 592,000 Californians lived in a public water district that received a water quality violation in 2017. But that doesn’t include people living in private, unregulated districts. London said some of the violations are worse than others, such as those involving arsenic, nitrates or uranium contaminates. Some of the violations, he added, could be less severe. ""All violations have some kind of health risk associated,"" he added.  California Gov. Gavin Newsom delivered his first State of the State Address on Feb. 12, 2018. AP photo.  Not everyone is counted Hinton said on top of those living in regulated districts, there are many thousands more who live in small, rural communities that rely on unregulated private wells. Some of those wells also experience contamination, but aren’t counted in the water board report. A McClatchy investigation published in June 2018 found at least 6 million Californians are served by water providers that have been in violation of state standards at some point since 2012. Darrin Polhemus, deputy director for the water board's division of drinking water, said Newsom’s figure is accurate based on a tally this month of the regulated, public water systems alone. That report includes violations for an additional contaminant, the cancer-causing man-made chemical Trichloropropane, referred to as 1,2,3,-TCP. The addition of that contaminant boosts the number of people living in a regulated district to ""now over one million people,"" he said.   ""The estimated population … of the public water systems regulated by the State Water Board that are currently out of compliance is 1,081,328,"" Polhemus said in an email. ""This number increased recently because we added those systems that are now out of compliance with our 1,2,3-TCP Maximum Contaminant Level."" Our ruling Gov. Gavin Newsom claimed ""more than a million Californians"" don’t have ""clean water to bathe in or drink."" A group that advocates for clean drinking water and a UC Davis researcher agreed with Newsom’s figure, with the researcher saying the number is significantly higher than one million. They pointed to a state water board report showing nearly 600,000 people lived in a regulated public water district that received a water quality violation in 2017. They noted that many thousands more people live in districts with unregulated and contaminated private wells but are not counted on the water board’s tally.

There are millions of tons of debris in the world’s oceans; an estimated eight million metric tons of plastic find their way there each year, according to Ocean Conservancy. Is it accurate, we asked, to summarize the legislation as a bill ""to clean millions of tons of garbage from the world’s oceans."" ""Not exactly,"" said Jordana Merran, communications manager for the group. Rather, the law Trump signed reauthorizes ""the longstanding amount of $10 million annually"" for NOAA’s Marine Debris Program, she said. ""The program does support, among other efforts, Ocean Conservancy’s International Coastal Cleanup, in which volunteers collect millions of pounds of garbage off beaches and waterways annually across the globe. However, many entities provide financial support for the ICC."" According to a transcript of Trump’s remarks as he signed the bill on Oct. 11, he said more than 8 million tons of garbage is dumped into oceans every year. The Save Our Seas Act ""will help address this problem,"" he said. ""We also are strengthening that up to improve waste management overseas and clean up our nation’s waters."" The legislation, which was sponsored by U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, and cosponsored by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, had bipartisan support. It doesn’t direct the country to clean millions of tons of garbage from marine environments. Rather, the bill reauthorizes and amends the Marine Debris Act ""to promote international action to reduce marine debris, and for other purposes,"" according to the law. But it’s not specific about how much debris, or how it should be cleaned up. For example, in cases of a ""severe marine debris event""—when natural disasters like tsunamis or storms cause unusually large amounts of marine debris—the United States would ""assist in the cleanup and response required by the severe marine debris event,"" the bill says. It also notes the president should ""support research and development on systems and materials that reduce"" the amount of solid waste in the marine environment, as well as work with other countries that discharge waste into the water to develop ""mechanisms to reduce such discharges."" And there are other suggestions in the law, such as studying of the economic impacts of marine debris. The Marine Debris Program, meanwhile, was established in 2006 to ""identify, determine sources of, assess, prevent, reduce, and remove marine debris and address the adverse impacts of marine debris on the economy in the United States."" But it also doesn’t specify how many tons of debris the country will clean, in the words of the Facebook post.

"California’s deadly wildfires ""would never happen"" with ""proper Forest Management.""","President Trump blamed a lack of ""proper Forest Management"" for California’s deadly wildfires in a tweet on Tuesday, repeating his overly simplistic claim about the cause of the infernos that have ravaged the state in recent years. Eighty-six people were killed and 14,000 homes destroyed in November when the Camp Fire tore through Northern California’s Butte County, making it the most deadly and destructive fire in state history. With better forest management, the fires ""would never happen,"" Trump asserted in his tweet. The president also repeated his threat to withhold billions of dollars in federal fire recovery money. ""Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forest fires that, with proper Forest Management, would never happen. Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives & money!"" We fact-checked a similar claim in a November Trump tweet and rated it False: ""There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor,"" Trump charged. We'll review the facts on what causes California's fires, and rate Trump's latest claim. Our research California’s firestorms aren’t caused by just one factor. Instead, climate change, forest management and urban sprawl all contribute, according to forestry, fire and climate experts.    Thinning out forests, setting prescribed burns and clearing brush can help reduce the severity of fires. But California’s stronger winds, higher temperatures and drier conditions, all attributed to climate change, make fires worse. So does the fact that more people and power lines are now situated in forested areas, increasing the chances of sparking an inferno. ""It is a complex situation. Simple pronouncements on a subject like this are almost always in error,"" Keith Gilless, a UC Berkeley professor of forest economics and chairman of the California Board of Forestry and Fire Protection, told us in November. Additionally, Trump’s claim suggests the state controls most forest management decisions. In reality, California owns just 2 percent of forest land in the state while the federal government owns upwards of 60 percent.   The rest is owned by private landowners, timber companies and Native American tribes. Responses to Trump’s tweet California Professional Firefighters President Brian Rice responded in a statement on Tuesday to Trump’s tweet: ""The president’s attempt to pin sole blame for California’s wildfire problems on the state’s forest management is flat wrong. While forest health can be a contributing factor in large fires, more than 60 percent of these forests are controlled by the federal government, not California. And yet, the federal government has cut $2 billion from the US Forest Service even as California has spent more on forest management."" Meanwhile, GOP Rep. Doug LaMalfa, who represents Butte County where the Camp Fire destroyed 14,000 homes and killed 86 people in November, said he shares ""the President’s great frustration with California’s choking regulations from the stranglehold environmental groups have on the state,"" and the need for more forest management. The congressman added, however, ""the immediate problem for fire victims is the first need, and threats to FEMA funding are not helpful and will not solve the longer term forest management regulatory problems."" Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized the president’s threat, saying on Twitter: ""Mr. President -- Just yesterday, @OregonGovBrown, (and Washington) @GovInslee, and I sent a letter asking the federal government to work with us in taking on these unprecedented wildfires. We have been put in office by the voters to get things done, not to play games with lives.""

"""We need to also recognize that we just had two of the coldest years, biggest drop in global temperatures that we have had since the 1980s, the biggest in the last 100 years. We don't talk about that.""","If man’s impact on climate goes unchecked, global warming could inflict devastating long-term effects on the environment, economy and public health, warn U.S. government scientists in a major new report. But while some heard the 1,600-page National Climate Assessment as a blaring distress call, others were less alarmed. On NBC’s Meet the Press, Danielle Pletka, a foreign policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, allowed that climate change is happening, but hastened to add that she didn’t know if it’s caused by humans. (In fact, scientists say they are the main contributor.) She argued the issue of climate change is subject to ""hysteria"" and said certain weather phenomena, like periods of global cooling, are overlooked by the mainstream media narrative. ""We need to also recognize that we just had two of the coldest years, biggest drop in global temperatures that we have had since the 1980s, the biggest in the last 100 years,"" Pletka said during a panel discussion. ""We don't talk about that because it's not part of the agenda."" Climate scientists told us that part of Pletka’s claim is false and part is misleading. Pletka said we just had two of the coldest years on record. That’s wrong. Gavin Schmidt, a climatologist and director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, pointed us to a chart of NASA data showing global average temperatures over time:  The far-right dots represent the global temperatures of 2017 and 2016. According to this data, they are actually some of the warmest years on record — which contradicts this portion of Pletka’s claim. We’d note that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which has a slightly different way of calculating temperature, shows 2016 and 2015 as the warmest years on record. In the United States, according to NASA data, 2017 and 2016 were the second- and third-warmest years.  The other piece of Pletka’s claim — about cold spells — was not so much false, as misleading. She told us she was relying on an article from Real Clear Markets with the headline, ""Did You Know the Greatest Two-Year Global Cooling Event Just Took Place?"" The April 2018 article notes that from February 2016 to February 2018 (the latest month available at the time), global average temperatures dropped 0.56 degrees C. ""You have to go back to 1982-84 for the next biggest two-year drop,"" the article states, referring also to the NASA data on global average temperatures. (The 1982-84 drop was 0.47 degrees C.) Climate scientists told us this is technically true, but that it misses the bigger trend that’s taken place over decades. ""Basically, it’s just a statistical fluke that people have grabbed because it sounds good,"" Schmidt said. ""It has no relevance for the long-term trends.""   The drop in temperatures after 2016 was also unsurprising, climatologists said. 2016 was especially hot because it was at the peak of the last El Niño, a recurring event when the surface of the Pacific Ocean warms, leading to higher global average temperatures of a few tenths of a degree. As the event concluded, things cooled off. ""So the subsequent drop in temperature isn't surprising,"" said Judith Curry, a climatologist and former chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology. ""A two-year trend is not meaningful in terms of understanding anything about how climate is changing."" The Real Clear article is ostensibly a critique of the mainstream media’s failure to cover cold spells, which the author argues should garner as much coverage as heat waves and extreme weather phenomena linked to climate change. (""None of this argues against global warming,"" the author states.) Pletka said, ""We just had two of the coldest years, biggest drop in global temperatures that we have had since the 1980s, the biggest in the last 100 years."" Her claim that we just had two of the coldest years is wrong. Globally, 2016 and 2017 were the two warmest years on record, according to one measure. Climate scientists told us a two-year trend is meaningless in terms of understanding anything about how climate is changing. With that in mind, Pletka’s assertion that we’ve recently seen the biggest drop in global temperatures is a red herring. It’s based on a cherry-picked statistical fluke of no relevance, compared with long term trends. Bottom line: Cold spells can and do happen, but they do not negate the fact that global warming is real and a legitimate cause for concern, according to broad scientific consensus",False,"November 28, 2018"
"""There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor.""","As deadly wildfires forced more than a quarter million Californians to flee their homes, President Trump recently alleged the infernos are the result of nothing more than poor ""forest management."" He also threatened to eliminate unspecified federal funds. The Camp fire in Northern California’s rural Butte County had killed 42 people and destroyed more than 6,400 homes as of Monday, making it the state’s most deadly and destructive fire in history. Authorities said more than 200 people remained unaccounted for. The fire started on Nov. 8, 2018 in a wooded area near the town of Paradise. Meanwhile, in Southern California, the Woolsey fire in Ventura and Los Angeles counties was blamed for the death of two people and had destroyed an estimated 435 structures. That blaze started on a suburban hillside, not a forest. In his first public comments about the fires, Trump tweeted on Nov. 10, 2018:   ""There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!""  He tweeted again on Nov. 11, 2018: ""With proper Forest Management, we can stop the devastation constantly going on in California. Get Smart!"" Trump’s comments drew sharp rebukes from firefighters and state officials, both for the threat to withhold funding during an emergency and for oversimplifying the reasons the fires are so destructive. In a tweet two days later, he thanked California’s firefighters and first responders. He also approved California's request for a major disaster declaration, freeing up federal aid for fire response and recovery. Given the strong reaction, we decided to fact-check the president’s contention ""there is no reason"" for California’s fires other than poor forest management. Our research Trump’s claim suggests the state government controls decisions over how and whether to thin forests, clear brush and set prescribed burns. In reality, California owns just 2 percent of forest land in the state, while the federal government owns upwards of 60 percent, said Keith Gilless, a UC Berkeley professor of forest economics and chairman of the California Board of Forestry and Fire Protection. The rest is owned by private landowners, timber companies and Native American tribes. Gilless said tree harvests have declined significantly on national forest lands over the past four decades due, at least in part, to legal challenges by environmentalists concerned about clear-cutting. The professor added that money spent in the past on preventing fires has been diverted to fighting them. The state has made significant investments in forest management, he said, but ""has no leverage"" over the federal government to do the same. In August, McClatchy reported the Trump administration ""proposed slashing tens of millions of dollars"" for tree clearing. Gilless added that Trump’s tweet ignores additional key factors driving California’s recent ""firestorms,"" such as winds reaching near 60 miles per hour and bone dry conditions. With those extremes, ""even good preparation can be overcome,"" he said. ""I think the biggest problem with the comments was the lack of nuance,"" Gilless said, describing them as ""uninformed."" ""It is a complex situation. Simple pronouncements on a subject like this are almost always in error."" Asked about Trump’s tweets in an interview on CNN, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Deputy Chief Scott McLean declined to respond directly, citing ""the lack of information given in that tweet."" He went on to describe California’s changing weather patterns. ""What’s been pushing all the fires these last couple years? The winds. The erratic wind behavior. The high temperatures early in the year that have dried out all this vegetation,"" McLean said. Fire and climate experts also say the trend of more people moving into wildland areas increases the chances of sparking forest fires. Jesse Miller, an ecologist who studies wildfires and lectures at Stanford University, described Trump’s comments as ""off base and not capturing the complexity of the situation."" ""Forest management might be part of the issue, but those are mostly federal lands up there (where the Camp fire started east of Chico). So, (Trump’s) actually in charge of most of those lands. … He’s also not recognizing the role of climate change. That’s by far what I and a lot of people think is the biggest factor driving these fires right now in California."" The White House did not respond to a request for evidence supporting Trump’s tweet. Our ruling President Trump claimed in a tweet ""there is no reason"" for California’s deadly fires other than poor ""forest management."" Forestry and climate experts say forest management, which includes thinning out forests, setting prescribed burns and clearing brush, is only one factor. But it’s not the only one, and not necessarily the driving force in the state’s recent firestorms. California’s stronger winds, higher temperatures and drier conditions driven by climate change are also making the fires worse. That’s in addition to the fact that more people now live in forested areas, increasing the chances of sparking an inferno.

So we wondered whether it is accurate that Manchin supported Hillary Clinton’s and Barack Obama’s efforts to kill coal jobs. As we have previously noted, Manchin did back Clinton in the 2016 election — an endorsement that turned out to be strongly at odds with most voters in a state that voted strongly for her Republican opponent, Donald Trump. (Manchin later told Politico that his decision to stick by Clinton was ""a mistake. It was a mistake politically."") But the Morrissey ad didn’t just refer to Manchin’s endorsement of the candidates. It went a step further and said that Manchin specifically supported their coal policies. And that doesn’t appear to be correct. In his initial campaign for Senate in 2010, he famously ran an ad in which he shot a copy of the cap-and-trade bill proposed by Obama and other Democrats that would have curbed emissions, potentially hurting the coal industry. (The bill was never enacted.) In an 2013 Washington Post article, Manchin said that Obama’s climate initiative -- which would have put coal at a disadvantage to other forms of energy -- amounted to a declaration of war on the coal industry. ""The regulations the President wants to force on coal are not feasible. And if it’s not feasible, it’s not reasonable,"" Manchin said. Manchin went on to say in the article that it is not acceptable to get rid of coal. ""It’s clear now that the president has declared a war on coal. It’s simply unacceptable that one of the key elements of his climate change proposal places regulations on coal that are completely impossible to meet with existing technology."" He joined Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., to introduce the Affordable Reliable Energy Now Act, which the lawmakers touted as helping ""rein in President Obama’s Clean Power Plan."" In 2015, he emphasized his opposition to Obama’s Clean Power Plan in a letter to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy. He also urged constituents to direct their opposition to the plan at field hearings. Saying he believed that the plan would ""result in escalating utility bills for Mountain State residents and even more coal mining job losses,"" Manchin wrote that ""forcing new coal-fired plants to meet standards when experts know that the required technology is not sustainably operational on a commercial scale makes absolutely no sense. By requiring technology that has never been adequately demonstrated, the EPA is forcing an industry to shut down and consumers to pay higher utility bills."" He also voted to advance a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to reverse the ""Waters of the U.S."" (WOTUS) rule, arguing that it would ""impact the coal mining in West Virginia."" Manchin’s Senate website also examples of Manchin supporting the coal industry, such as introducing in 2018 the Fossil Energy Utilization, Enhancement, and Leadership Act, which was designed to ""protect coal jobs and develop new technologies to be used domestically and exported internationally,"" and supporting efforts to use the Defense Production Act to protect ""clean-burning, coal-fired power plants."" The Morrisey campaign did not respond to repeated requests to offer examples of Manchin opposing the coal industry. A tweet posted by Patrick Morrisey and shared by Donald Trump Jr. said that Manchin ""supported Obama and Clinton's campaigns to kill coal jobs."" Manchin actively opposed the two biggest efforts backed by Obama and Clinton over coal industry opposition: the cap-and-trade bill and the Clean Power Plan. He also pursued other legislative and regulatory efforts that aided the coal industry",False,"November 5, 2018"
"""Intensifying Hurricane Willa headed directly toward 10,000 migrant caravan path.""","A headline on a site called Patriotic Express misleads by giving the impression that a hurricane is headed directly toward a caravan of immigrants bound for the United States. ""Intensifying Hurricane Willa headed directly toward 10,000 migrant caravan path,"" said the Oct. 22 headline on patrioticexpress.com. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Hurricane Willa is projected to make landfall on Mexico’s Pacific coast on Tuesday, Oct.t 23. However, its projected landfall is more than 1,000 miles north of the caravan’s current location. The latest news reports say the caravan is in the town of Huixtla, in southern Mexico. Hurricane Willa’s watch and warning advisories do not extend to Huixtla. Patriotic Express cites weather.com (The Weather Channel) as reporting that the hurricane ""should approach landfall along the southwestern coast of mainland Mexico by late Tuesday, which is expected to occur anywhere from near or north of Mazatlán to near Puerto Vallarta."" (The Patriotic Express links to an outdated page on weather.com, but latest updates on weather.com maintain that landfall is expected in that general region, ""south of Mazatlán and well north of Puerto Vallarta."") The caravan is far from that point. Parts of the Patriotic Express story are less misleading than the headline, saying that the hurricane ""is set to cross the path that the migrants will eventually cross."" ""As the caravan heads north, there’s no doubt that they’ll eventually run into deteriorating conditions leftover from Willa — which we’ll soon see what level of damage it imposes upon populated areas of Mexico,"" the post said. ""The strain on resources in many areas of Mexico is already bad — let alone the possibility of being hit by a major hurricane and a large army of hungry migrants."" Though the caravan is heading north, it’s uncertain if it will cross the towns expected to be impacted by Hurricane Willa. Even then, the caravan — walking north — would be many days away from reaching that point if it went that direction. (If it chose to go to the Brownsville, Texas, border, it would be on the opposite side of the hurricane’s expected landfall.) The number of people in the caravan has increased since it started Oct. 13, reports peg the number traveling at around 7,000 — lower than 10,000 claimed in the Patriotic Express headline. A headline on patrioticexpress.com claimed, ""Intensifying Hurricane Willa headed directly toward 10,000 migrant caravan path.""

"Says 60 percent of Austin’s ""waterways are found to be contaminated with fecal matter and deemed unsafe to swim.""","One of six candidates challenging Austin Mayor Steve Adler in the November 2018 election said that more than half of Austin’s waterways are so dirty, they’re deemed ""unsafe to swim."" The splashy claim by pedicabbie Alexander Strenger appears among entries on an E.thepeople interactive website showing questions to Texans running for office and responses. Question: ""What is your top environmental concern and how would you address it?"" Strenger’s reply: ""60% of our waterways are found to be contaminated with fecal matter and deemed unsafe to swim."" Strenger then suggested that dog owners who fail to clean up are mostly to blame and said that as mayor, he’d step up police presence near bodies of water to ensure more owners get fined. Candidate cites news story By email, Strenger told us he based his statement on an August 2018 Austin American-Statesman news story. The story said that according to a study by the Environment Texas Research and Policy Center, ""60 percent of Austin waterways tested last year were so contaminated with fecal matter as to be unsafe for swimming."" Not that Austinites were told to ditch their swimsuits. Popular swimming destinations such as Barton Springs Pool, Barton Creek, Lake Travis, Lake Austin and Walter E. Long Lake did not test positive for unsafe bacteria at any point in 2017, the story said. On the icky side, Austin’s Waller Creek, Walnut Creek, West Bouldin Creek, East Bouldin Creek and Blunn Creek frequently had unsafe levels of worrisome bacteria, the story citing the study said. Colorado River test sites east of Lady Bird Lake were found to have high levels of bacteria two out of the four times they were tested, the story said. According to the story, the researchers ""cited stormwater runoff as a cause for some of the biological pollution and recommended that cities require infrastructure improvements to mitigate runoff, such as permeable pavement. They also urged cities to educate residents about bacteria pollution caused by pet waste."" Todd Jackson, a field biologist with the city’s watershed department, told the newspaper that the most likely culprit for bacterial contamination was aging infrastructure, including hard-to-spot leaks in residential and commercial utility lines in older urbanized areas. Figures supported by study We dog-paddled to the study, ""Swim at Your Own Risk,"" which says that researchers found that 46 of 76 Austin sites, nearly 61 percent, had at least one 2017 water sample showing excessive bacteria levels--indicating unsafe conditions for swimming, tubing or wading safely. The samples are taken quarterly or less by the City of Austin’s Watershed Protection Department. Water ""samples were listed as unsafe for swimming if they exceeded levels of bacteria deemed safe for swimming by Texas regulation,"" the study says. For freshwater, the study says, ""safety is determined by counts of the bacteria E. coli. These bacteria, while they are not typically dangerous for humans, are used as indicators of fecal contamination, which can contain bacteria that make people sick,"" the study says. An accompanying chart shows that on each of the four days that samples were taken from two creeks, Blunn and East Bouldin, one site or more showed too much E. coli to be considered safe for swimming. Negative results were less consistent for the river and three other creeks, the chart indicates.  SOURCE: Study, ""Swim at Your Own Risk, Bacteria Pollution in Texas Beaches and Waterways Threatens Public Health,"" Environment Texas Research & Policy Center, August 2018 (fetched Oct. 11, 2018) An alternate interpretation To our inquiry, Luke Metzger of Environment Texas sent a spreadsheet by email showing the number of times each sampling showed higher-than-acceptable levels of E. coli. The sheet enabled us to speculate about a less dramatic read of the results. That is, just nine of the Austin sites, 12 percent, showed excessive E. coli at every sampling from the year. Metzger replied that he wouldn’t call that an all-clear to dive in. If ""there's a problem even once during the year, there's a risk that people could get sick swimming or wading,"" Metzger said. ""Just like Russian roulette, just because you don't die when it lands on an empty chamber doesn't make it a safe game to play."" City of Austin says about half of creeks contain too much dangerous bacteria Next, we asked city and state water experts to speak to the study’s judgment about the swimmability of Austin waterways. A city spokeswoman, Susan Garnett, said that at any given time, about half of Austin’s creeks exceed the state’s bacteria threshold for ""contact recreation,"" meaning an activity such as splashing or swimming that increases a person’s chances of swallowing water. That conclusion, she said, ties to samplings taken from about 125 sites in 45 watersheds over the past 30 years or so. Garnett said by email: ""The higher the E. coli count, the more likely there is fecal contamination and the higher the risk there is for waterborne illness. Any natural body of water will have some amount of fecal matter due to fish and wildlife, and the fecal matter from warm-blooded animals such as birds, bats, dogs, deer and other mammals will include E. coli."" Garnett’s 50 percent figure comports with what the city told the American-Statesman for an August 2014 news story quoting a city environmental engineer, Chris Herrington, estimating that half the city's watersheds had excessive levels of E. coli. Four Austin creeks were seen to be exceeding the state limit of 126 colonies per 100 milliliters of water (a method of gauging bacteria)--a level at which about eight out of 1,000 swimmers would have increased risks for gastroenteritis and offshoot aches and illnesses, the story said. Yet officials also pointed out that with the creeks often running shallow, it was almost impossible to fully immerse in the waters. Herrington said then that the state thresholds are ""protective and very conservative."" Exceeding them, he said, ""doesn't mean an immediate health risk."" State spokesman: Five impaired Austin-area waterways in 2014 By email, TCEQ spokesman Andrew Keese responded that in 2014, the latest year analyzed in a commission report, the agency found five of 53 Austin-area waterways, accounting for 13 percent of the area’s ""stream miles,"" to be impaired. Each waterway had enough E. coli over multiple samplings to represent ""an elevated level of risk of illness from contact recreation,"" Keese said. Still, Keese said, that didn’t ""necessarily indicate areas considered unsafe to swim. Swimming in all natural waters (including those that meet water quality standards) comes with risk, whether that be from pathogen exposure or other risks,"" Keese wrote. Keese noted that the Environment Texas study relied on single samplings in one year while the agency makes determinations based on 20 samplings over several years which, Keese wrote, ""provides a better overall assessment of risks associated with recreational activities such as swimming."" Keese went on: ""Bacteria data can be quite variable from day to day, and results are dependent upon a number of factors, such as antecedent precipitation."" Commission officials also said through Keese that the study appeared to consider samples from some waterways and not others--notably Austin’s Bull Creek. We turned back to Brian Zabcik of Environment Texas, who said that the study’s consideration of a few water samples taken in 2017 was a deliberate effort to spotlight what the state’s long-term approach could obscure. By email, Zabcik said the researchers didn’t field Bull Creek results because the city samples water from that creek in even-numbered years. Zabcik further quoted Andrew Clamann, a city environmental scientist, advising: ""There are too many watersheds in Austin to monitor them all every year."" Another perspective For out-of-Austin perspective, we reached the Meadows Center for Water and the Environment at Texas State University, which is working with the city and the Shoal Creek Conservancy to develop a watershed protection plan for Austin’s Shoal Creek Watershed. Nick Dornak, the center’s director of watershed services, said by email that statewide, the majority of monitored streams don’t meet their ""designated use,"" as defined by TCEQ, ""due to high levels of bacteria and other contaminants. Other common impairments include high levels of dissolved solids (salts) and depressed dissolved oxygen."" Dornak, asked to assess the Environment Texas study and TCEQ’s response, said: ""The study looked at a ‘snapshot’ of water quality and represented a kind of worst-case scenario that may be a little misleading."" Still, Dornak wrote, this ""data does show that there are definitely days where swimming may not be safe around Austin-area streams."" Our ruling Strenger said 60 percent of Austin’s ""waterways are found to be contaminated with fecal matter and deemed unsafe to swim."" This claim fairly echoes a study finding that 60 percent of Austin waterways sampled by the city had so much E. coli bacteria that swimming could pose health risks. Then again, the study indicates a smaller share of waterways, 12 percent, had too much of the bacteria at every sampling. It’s worth noting too that the samplings were all taken in 2017, a year ago",Half True,"October 16, 2018"
"Says he ""beat (President Barack) Obama at the Supreme Court, saving coal jobs.""","In his quest to win a U.S. Senate seat, Republican candidate Patrick Morrisey is touting a legal accomplishment that he said aided the state’s coal industry. A television ad by Morrisey says, among other things, that Morrisey ""beat (President Barack) Obama at the Supreme Court, saving coal jobs."" (An earlier ad made a similar claim as well.) FIRST TV AD: West Virginia deserves a Senator who will be an ally for @realDonaldTrump, who has a record of beating Obama to save coal jobs, and who will always defend our Second Amendment rights. Watch our first TV ad here --> #WVsen #WVpol pic.twitter.com/cpQ1AmFh7l   Is that correct? We took a closer look. This part of the claim refers to the February 2016 decision by five justices of the U.S. Supreme Court to issue a stay that blocked the Clean Power Plan from going into effect. The plan, developed by the Obama administration’s Environmental Protection Agency and initially released in 2014, would have set a standard for power plants’ emissions of carbon dioxide, which most scientists say are causing global warming. Critics of the plan included the coal industry, which would have suffered because coal has relatively high emissions of carbon dioxide. The stay put the proposal on hold, and it was officially scrapped under President Donald Trump. In October 2015, Morrisey was a key player in leading a coalition of 24 states in a lawsuit against the Clean Power Plan. The lawsuit came the same day as the rule was filed in the Federal Register — the first day the rule could be challenged in court. In an unusual move, the Supreme Court issued its stay only a few months later. Officially, the five justices who granted the stay referred to a related case, North Dakota vs. EPA. And because West Virginia was part of a coalition of two dozen other states, Morrisey did not accomplish this singlehandedly. That said, Morrisey was widely noted as a leader of the effort. ""He was very aggressive in bringing the early rounds of the litigation and trying to get a court order to stop EPA from even finalizing the rule,"" Jeff Holmstead, a former EPA air regulator who is representing a coal industry group in the lawsuit, told the Hill newspaper not long after the Supreme Court stayed the EPA program. ""He really has taken very much a leading role in the Clean Power Plan litigation."" The same month, the Associated Press singled out Morrisey for his role in the legal battle, in an article headlined, ""Rising GOP star in West Virginia fight for coal against EPA."" In 2015, the liberal Economic Policy Institute estimated that the Clean Power Plan could eliminate 63,838 coal mining-related jobs (though the same group estimated that the plan would increase the number of jobs overall by roughly 360,000). So, shelving the plan would be expected to save coal jobs. As it turns out, employment in coal mining has rebounded modestly since the plan was stayed. According to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, coal mining employment hit a low in July, August and September 2016. Since then, it’s been on a slight upswing.   In the two-year span since its low point in 2016, coal mining employment has risen by about 8.5 percent, or 4,200 jobs in all. That said, coal mining employment remains far below its mid-1980s peak, and even well below its pre-Great Recession level. An ad for Patrick Morrisey said he ""beat Obama at the Supreme Court, saving coal jobs."" Morrisey wasn’t the only legal player involved in the lawsuit that derailed the Clean Power Plan, but he was widely considered a key figure. And employment levels in the coal industry have recovered, though modestly, and have only returned to their levels from early 2016",Mostly True,"September 20, 2018"
"""According to SCUBA divers, Summersville Lake is the clearest freshwater lake east of the Mississippi River.""","Does West Virginia have the clearest freshwater lake east of the Mississippi River?

The Huntington District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers created the lake in the 1960s.   Justice’s tweet links to an article on wvtourism.com, published by the West Virginia Tourism Office, an agency of the West Virginia Department of Commerce. The article describes the lake as great for swimming, boating, and underwater exploration. The destination has dive sites where rock formations can be seen 100 feet underwater. However, the WV Tourism article did not offer a specific source for the claim. We contacted the office, and they did not respond. When we reached out to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Huntington District, Toby Wood, project manager for Summersville Lake, said that the label ""The Little Bahamas of the East"" originated with a SCUBA magazine. ""We consider that a claim-to-fame, and we repeat it often,"" Wood said. In Google searches, we found references to that nickname attributed to Skin Diver magazine but did not locate the original article. More broadly, however, Wood has ""no way of knowing if the lake is the ‘the clearest freshwater lake east of the Mississippi River,’ as the governor claimed."" We reached out to Peter Oliver, editor-in-chief of the National Association of Underwater Instructors’ magazine, Sources, and he said that from his experience, Summersville Lake has the same color as most lakes and reservoirs. ""You’d be OK, I think, to call Summersville ‘one of the clearest,’ but it has that green tint common to almost all freshwater lakes and reservoirs. The water in the Florida spring systems is what we usually call ‘gin clear’ and since the water does not stand in the small lakes but flows out it stays clear,"" Oliver said.

Justice tweeted, ""According to SCUBA divers, Summersville Lake is the clearest freshwater lake east of the Mississippi River."" This facts on this claim are more opaque than the governor lets on. There’s no question that Summersville Lake attracts divers who appreciate its clear waters, and there is evidence that it has long been called ""the Little Bahamas of the East."" Justice’s tweet went beyond that, saying specifically that the lake is the clearest in the eastern United States.

"Studies are showing California’s wildfires ""are producing more emissions than all of our cars are doing.""","Wildfires have ravaged California again this year, destroying hundreds of homes and killing six firefighters, as well as several residents. This year also produced the largest single fire in California’s history, the Ranch Fire, which had burned more than 400,000 acres and spread across four counties near the Mendocino National Forest as of late August. Smoke up and down the state, for days at a time, has blanketed metro areas miles from the fires, raising worries about air quality and pollution. The wildfires have led some, including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, to claim the blazes are spewing out more pollution than the state’s millions of vehicles. ""I have a real concern about air quality because of where I come from,"" McCarthy, a Republican who represents the southern San Joaquin Valley, including Bakersfield, said during a speech in Sacramento on Aug. 15, 2018. ""(We’re at the) bottom of all the mountains and we collect (air pollution) all the way from San Francisco."" ""What I have found, because of these fires, there are studies that are showing they are producing more emissions than all of our cars are doing,"" he added.  SOURCE: Public Policy Institute of California Was McCarthy right? We decided to fact-check his wildfires-versus-cars comparison. Our research Sean Raffuse, an analyst at the UC Davis Air Quality Research Center, told us McCarthy’s statement is correct, but for only for one category of emissions — particulate matter. The claim is not true, however, for climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions, he said. Cars still produce far more of those. Particulate matter, or PM, is a mixture of microscopic particles and liquid droplets that, when inhaled, can affect the heart and lungs and cause serious health problems. For months, officials have issued health warnings that particulate matter from the wildfires could trigger asthma attacks or aggravate chronic heart and lung diseases. Specifically, Raffuse said, the fires produce more PM 2.5 than all cars. PM 2.5 refers to particles two and one half microns or less in width, or about thirty times smaller than that of a human hair. ""PM 2.5 emissions are greater than what we see from cars, and that’s typical, not just of California during the wildfire season,"" he said, ""but even if you look overall at the nation for an entire year, there will be more emissions from particles from wildfires than there will be from motor vehicles."" Clean combustion regulations, he said, are one reason vehicles produce fewer particulate matter than fires. Earlier this month, the Trump administration proposed rules that would ease vehicle emissions standards nationwide. The proposal would also challenge the right of states, California in particular, to set their own, more stringent tailpipe pollution standards. Greenhouse gas emissions Bill Stewart, a researcher at the UC Berkeley Center for Forestry, said there’s a key point missing from McCarthy’s statement. While fires emit more particulate matter, cars produce far more greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide, he said. ""Those are two important but different issues,"" Stewart said. Mike Kleeman, a UC Davis professor of environmental engineering, added that wildfires also emit some greenhouse gases. ""But burned areas also regrow during which time they act as a net carbon sink.  Assuming a burned area regrows completely over a time of decades, the net CO2 emissions should be low,"" Kleeman wrote in an email. ""Wildfires are a problem,"" he added, ""and we should be taking steps to reduce their frequency and intensity. But it isn't an ‘apples to apples’ comparison to an every-day source like cars."" McCarthy’s response Asked for evidence supporting the claim, McCarthy’s spokesman pointed to an October 2017 NBC News story that examined the emissions produced by that year’s deadly Wine Country fires. The story had the misleading headline: ""California Wildfires Emitted a Year's Worth of Car Pollution in Less Than a Week."" It quoted Raffuse of UC Davis, who told NBC the fires had released the same amount of particulate matter as come from California vehicles in one year. He didn’t claim the fires had produced more of all types of emissions than cars. In the article, the researcher ""pointed out cars pollute in other ways, too."" Raffuse summed up the congressman’s statement saying it’s ""partially correct but omits a key distinction."" McCarthy’s spokesman did not cite any specific studies to support the claim. We reviewed several that described wildfire emissions as a growing concern, but did not say they produce more pollution overall compared with cars. One such report by the Sierra Nevada Conservancy in 2014 found that by the year 2085, emissions from wildfires are projected to be equal to the annual emissions of about one fifth of all of the cars currently registered in California. Our ruling House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy recently claimed ""because of these fires, there are studies that are showing they are producing more emissions than all of our cars are doing."" Wildfires produce more of one key pollutant, particulate matter, than cars, both in California and nationwide. But that’s all.

""There’s nobody cleaner than us, and it’s getting better and better."" Does the United States dominate when it comes to water and air quality? Let’s take a look. The Environmental Performance Index is the go-to source for questions on environmental quality. Yale and Columbia University researchers teamed up with the World Economic Forum in 2018 to compile the data. Using 10 categories, they ranked the United States 27th. On air it ranks 10th and on water, 29th. Among wealthy democracies, the United States ranks toward the bottom, according to Zachary Wendling, principal investigator at the Environmental Performance Index. Switzerland ranked first on the overall index, Barbados ranked first on air quality, and eight European countries tied for first on water. European countries, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and Japan tend to top the United States in environmental performance. Clean air The air quality ranking is broken up into three parts. On indoor air quality, the United States ranks first. We don’t cook by burning biomass, so that isn’t surprising, Jeffrey Geddes, a Boston University professor who studies air quality, told us. The United States ranks 88th on exposure to particulate matter, which Geddes called ""a really good indicator for health effects from air pollution."" The scientists used satellites and ground-based measurements to collect the data for 228 countries and territories dating from 2008 to 2015. That predates Trump. In general, however, changes between 2018 scores and the baseline (roughly 10 years earlier) are mixed and small, Wendling said. The Environmental Protection Agency’s own research shows a continued decline in air pollutants from 1990. But experts said Trump’s deregulatory practices may have the opposite effect. ""Deregulation of automobile emissions standards will increase air pollution, particularly in dense urban areas,"" said Elizabeth Albright, an environmental science professor at Duke University. The United States ranks 29th overall in water quality. In drinking water, it ranks first (alongside nine other countries) and in sanitation, 31st. ""For both drinking water and sanitation, the United States is performing okay in absolute terms, with about 3.3 disability-adjusted life-years lost per 100,000 people from risks due to unsafe drinking water, as compared to 6.4 for unsafe sanitation,"" Wendling said. Wendling said the lower sanitation ranking might be explained by rural populations that rely on septic tanks, but there is enough uncertainty in the data that estimates for high-income countries should be treated with caution. Experts said the United States still had a long ways to go before being ranked cleanest. ""Any idea we have the freshest water is entirely laughable,"" said Ashok Gadgil, an environmental engineering professor at Berkeley University. ""The U.S. does a very good job of producing relatively clean drinking water at very low cost, but we fall far short on our investments in water infrastructure investments—that was the case in Flint, and it also is the case in thousands of other water systems around the country,"" said Marc Edwards, a Virginia Tech environmental and water resources engineer. ""Some people could argue it is clean enough for the price, but we are not the cleanest."" In 2016, 5,363 water systems serving 17.6 million people violated EPA's lead and copper rule, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmentalist non-profit group. The White House did not respond our request for comment. Trump said, ""I want clean air. I want crystal clean water. And we’ve got it. We’ve got the cleanest country in the planet right now.""

The PAC sent us information from local news reports, as well as county records about the project. Graham Companies is involved in the mall project. But Graham has not served on the board for the company since she won elected office, and her family is not the project developer. When Graham started in Congress in 2015, she stepped down from the company and put all of her assets in a transparent trust.

Triple Five, the company that developed Minnesota's Mall of America, wants to build the $4 billion mall project, which includes an indoor ski slope, hotel and a submarine lake. The project between Interstate 75 and Florida’s Turnpike in northwest Miami-Dade County is expected to draw 30 million visitors a year. Diaz de la Portilla said the amount of money the Graham Companies will receive from the land sale is confidential. Jack McCabe, a South Florida real estate research analyst who isn’t involved in the project, estimated that the 80 acres would sell for between $2.4 million and $6.5 million. The Graham Companies is also planning to build a mixed-used development on 300 acres south of the mall. In May, the Miami-Dade County Commission voted in favor of zoning approval for the mall. In July, the South Florida Regional Planning Council voted against the project but that is largely symbolic because the county and the state have authority. It still has to go through several other approvals before it is built. County records show the American Dream will create about 14,530 permanent full-time jobs. About 64 percent of those workers would earn less than $25,000 a year. The federal poverty guideline is $25,100 for a family of four. For an individual it is $12,140. Diaz de la Portilla said the developer projects 25,000 permanent direct and indirect jobs based on the developer’s experience at other malls. He said the county used a specific model to project a range of direct jobs of 9,236 to 22,331. The project has drawn criticism from environmentalists, such as the Sierra Club and Everglades Trust. The trust endorsed Graham in spite of it. ""While we are fighting like the dickens to ensure the survival of the Everglades and the source of drinking water for eight million Floridians, mega-developers and projects like these continue to put it all at risk,"" said Everglades Trust executive director Kimberly Mitchell. The county staff analysis, which recommended approval, stated that the site contains wetlands. It also stated that the site is within the core foraging area of wood stork colonies and may provide habitat and/or foraging areas for several threatened and endangered animal species. The county’s environmental resources department drafted provisions within the development agreement related to stormwater management, natural resources and endangered species, Diaz de la Portilla said. The project is expected to generate 70,000 vehicle trips a day. Diaz de la Portilla said that the developer has to mitigate the impacts on the environment and the traffic, which includes spending more than $200 million on road infrastructure and public transportation. He said that the site has been inside the county’s Urban Development Boundary for over a decade. A Unite Here Florida TV ad said, ""Gwen Graham owns a $14 million stake in her family’s company that’s behind the American Dream Mall. ... While Graham and her family will make millions, Florida will be stuck with poverty wage jobs, endangered wildlife and massive traffic congestion."" The ad was imprecise when it said that her family’s company is ""behind the American Dream Mall."" That could create a misleading impression that her family is developing the mall. Her family owns about 80 acres which is under contract for the developer, less than half of the future mall site. We don’t know how much Graham and her family will earn from the sale of the land, which is under contract, but one real estate analyst told us the sale could be for millions of dollars. Graham’s financial disclosure shows she owned $13.7 million in stock in the Graham Companies in 2017. Graham has not been on the board of her family's company since she won elected office. About two-thirds of the permanent jobs will pay less than $25,000. That is the federal poverty guideline for a family of four, but more than twice the poverty level for an individual. Plans show that the development site includes habitats for threatened and endangered species and will add to traffic in the area",Half True,"August 22, 2018"
"Says Rick Scott ""cut $700 million from water management.""","Did Florida Gov. Rick Scott slash funding for the state’s water management oversight? That’s what a recent tweet by the Florida Democratic Party claimed. ""Rolled back safeguards and septic-tank inspections. Cut $700 million from water management. Appointed cronies who act on behalf of polluters. Banned the term ‘climate change.’"" ""This water crisis has a name, and it’s Rick Scott,"" it concludes. Scott, who is term-limited as governor, is challenging Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson.  ☣️ Rolled back safeguards and septic-tank inspections☣️ Cut $700 million from water management☣️ Appointed cronies who act on behalf of polluters☣️ Banned the term ""climate change""This water crisis has a name, and it's Rick Scott. #FlaPol https://t.co/i1V93SWoge We’ve taken a look at some claims regarding Scott’s record on the environment before. With fears about algae blooms and red tide recently hitting the headlines, we were especially curious if Scott had actually ""cut $700 million from water management."" Scott did cut $700 million in funding from water management in 2011. He also implemented changes to how water management districts are funded that affect their finances in the long-term. Counting up the cuts  We began by reaching out to the Florida Democratic Party about its evidence for the claim. A party spokesperson sent us a 2018 Miami Herald column by Fabiola Santiago blaming Scott for dirty beaches, as well as a Palm Beach Post news article from 2011, near the end of Scott’s first year in office. That Palm Beach Post story begins with the line, ""The state's five water management districts have slashed their budgets by more than $700 million -- about 40 percent -- but Gov. Rick Scott, who initiated the cuts, wants a little more."" The state’s five districts have a variety of responsibilities, from water supply and quality management to flood and natural systems management. All five districts release their budgets on their websites annually. The districts release data for each financial year, which runs from Oct. 1 of the previous year to Sept. 30 of the named year. The first budgets that Scott had a say in came in the 2012 fiscal year, from Oct. 1, 2011, to Sept. 30, 2012. From the 2011 to 2012 fiscal years, the budgets of all five districts were cut across the board. The South Florida district suffered the most in cuts. Its FY 2011 budget was $1.07 billion while its FY 2012 budget was $576.1 million. That’s a reduction of $493.9 million, or 49 percent.   Meanwhile, the Southwest Florida district’s budget was slashed by $124.3 million in FY 2012. Combined with the $13.9 million, $35 million, and $14 million cuts to the budgets of the Suwannee River district, St. Johns River district, and Northwest Florida district, respectively, those numbers add up to just over the $700 million.   However, since 2012, the overall budget of the five districts has risen by almost $300 million. So the difference between pre-Scott cut budgets and the current budgets is now not $700 million, but rather closer to $400 million.  Whose responsibility is it, anyway? We reached out to Scott’s press secretary for comment. Lauren Schenone told PolitiFact, ""Water management districts independently create their own budgets. Their budgetary decisions, including tax and revenue collection, are ultimately made by the board of each water management district — not the governor, so they are completely wrong on this."" Districts do begin the budget process themselves by creating a preliminary budget independently of the governor. But their budgets pass through a complex adoption process. They need to eventually be approved by many groups, including the Florida Senate president, the Florida House speaker, and each water management district’s governing board, whose members are appointed by the governor. According to section 373.536(5)(a) of the Florida Statutes, the governor has the final say ""to approve or disapprove water management district budgets in whole or in part."" So if the governor doesn’t like a specific item in a district’s budget, he or she can veto it. Scott has claimed responsibility for the water management district budget cuts in the past, such as in this radio address from August 2011. ""I took action on the proposed budgets of Florida’s five water management districts,"" Scott said. ""All together, these budgets reflect a reduction of more than $700 million over last year."" Scott also restricted how much revenue districts could collect. A large part of district budgets comes from revenue collected through property taxes. In 2011, Scott signed a bill into law that placed a limit on the maximum amount of property tax the districts could levy. That bill lowered district property tax revenues by 30 percent, or $210 million. ""Those (property tax) revenues have not been restored to their pre-Gov. Scott levels,"" said Aliki Moncrief, executive director of Florida Conservation Voters. ""Assuming the taxable value of Florida property stayed the same from 2011-2019, we are talking about at least $1.7 billion in lost revenue for water management districts (over the course of eight years)."" Scott took responsibility for those revenue cuts, too. In a June 2011 press release, he said, ""This property tax cut allows families and businesses to use more of their hard-earned money in the way they see best, rather than having to send it to a government agency."" Our ruling The Florida Democratic Party tweeted that Scott ""cut $700 million from water management."" The budgets of Florida’s five water management districts were collectively cut by over $700 million about a year into Scott’s first term. Since the governor has the final say over the water management districts’ budgets, the tweet is largely accurate. However, in the years since 2012, the districts’ budgets have started to rise again. The overall budget of the five districts is no longer $700 million less than the pre-Scott budget",Mostly True,"August 14, 2018"
"""California wildfires are being magnified & made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren’t allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized. It is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean.""","In his first tweet about this summer’s California wildfires, President Trump blamed environmental laws for making the blazes worse by preventing firefighters from using a ""massive amount of readily available water."" He said it’s ""being diverted into the Pacific Ocean."" The problem with that claim? The state’s firefighting agency said it’s had no complications accessing water, while fire experts said the state’s hot, dry and windy conditions are to blame for the infernos, not any water policy. Here’s what Trump tweeted on Aug. 5, 2018:  With blazes continuing to ravage the state, we set out on a fact check. We focused on the first portion of the tweet about water policy. Our research Scott McLean, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection told us, it’s the hot and dry conditions taking place earlier in the year that are leading to the extreme fires. ""We have had no issues accessing water to fight the fires,"" McLean wrote in an email. ""This year’s changing weather pattern is leading to more severe and destructive wildfires."" Keith Gilless is a UC Berkeley professor of forest economics and chairman of the California Board of Forestry and Fire Protection. He said he believes Trump is conflating two very different issues. There’s long been a conflict between farmers and environmental groups over how much water should go to crops versus rivers and lakes. But that fight hasn’t had any effect on firefighting. ""I think there’s some real confusion in the tweet,"" Gilless said. ""The issues over the allocation of water between environmental and agricultural interests have nothing to do with firefighting. And I’m not aware of any situation in which those conflicts have restricted the availability of water for firefighting purposes."" Heat, dry conditions blamed for fires Gilless said the reason California’s wildfires are so destructive this year is the state’s ""high heat, low relative humidity, high wind speeds and high fuel loading."" He said climate change is making these conditions more frequent. ""California is going through a really heartbreaking fire season right now,"" he added. ""Environmental laws about water have nothing to do with it from my perspective."" Gilless said Trump’s language about water ""being diverted into the Pacific Ocean,"" doesn’t make sense, as water naturally flows to the ocean. The argument about how much water should be captured before it gets to the ocean, again, is part of a different, unrelated debate. The second portion of Trump’s tweet, that California ""Must also tree clear to stop fire  spreading!"", is also confusing. Forestry experts say thinning trees is a well-established practice that can reduce the severity of fires. But clearing trees is more commonly associated with commercial logging practices, not fire management. Leroy Westerling, a UC Merced professor and wildfire specialist, told the San Francisco Chronicle that Trump’s tweet, ""On the water side, it boggles the mind."" The White House did not immediately respond to a request for evidence to support Trump’s tweet. A day before the tweet, the Trump administration approved California's request to declare a ""major disaster"" as the state continues to fight wildfires that have claimed at least nine lives. The declaration makes federal funds available to residents of Shasta County, where the Carr Fire outside Redding, California, has destroyed more than 1,000 homes.  Our rating President Trump claimed in a tweet that California’s wildfires are ""made so much worse by the bad environmental laws"" which prevent firefighters from accessing water. He added in the tweet that water ""is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean."" Trump appears to have conflated the state’s real water controversy between farmers and environmentalists with the unrelated issue of firefighting. The state’s fire agency, CalFire, said it has not had problems accessing water. And fire experts said it’s the state’s hot and bone-dry conditions, not environmental laws, that are making blazes more extreme",False,"August 6, 2018"
"""When a sinkhole began dumping toxic water in Florida's aquifer, Rick Scott tried to cover it up.""","Gwen Graham says Florida needs a governor who will fight to protect clean water, unlike, she said, Gov. Rick Scott. ""When a sinkhole began dumping toxic water in Florida's aquifer, Rick Scott tried to cover it up. I worked with the press to expose the secret sinkhole and hold Scott accountable,"" she tweeted July 18. Graham is one of five Democrats seeking the party’s nomination in the Aug. 28 primary to replace Scott, who is term-limited and running for U.S. Senate. Graham’s tweet linked to a 2016 Politico article in which Graham, then a congresswoman, was quoted blasting the state over its handling of a sinkhole at Mosaic’s Polk County phosphate plant. Here’s what Graham’s tweet has a point about: Scott’s administration, more specifically the Department of Environmental Protection, kept quiet about the sinkhole for weeks, later saying it didn’t know it was a sinkhole. But she went too far in stating that Scott himself ""tried to cover it up."" Her tweet also leaves out the actions Scott took once he did learn about the sinkhole. On Sept. 15, 2016, WFLA-Channel 8 broke the story about the sinkhole, which was the first time Mosaic commented about it publicly. The next day, WFLA reported that the Florida Department of Environmental Protection knew about the sinkhole but did not disclose it to the public. The 45-foot-wide sinkhole opened underneath a gypsum stack at a Mosaic phosphate fertilizer plant, dumping at least 215 million gallons of contaminated water into the Floridan aquifer over three weeks. Mosaic workers became aware of the leak on Aug. 27 and notified the department on Aug. 28. State inspectors arrived within 24 hours. Their initial report didn’t use the word ""sinkhole,"" but ""water loss incident."" Environmentalists and the media called for more transparency by the state government. But state law at the time did not require the department to inform the public about a spill into the aquifer if it had not spread off-site. DEP officials described their response to the spill as going ""above and beyond the requirements of Florida law by working with Mosaic to notify the nearest adjacent home­owners who may want their drinking water wells tested."" Jon Steverson, DEP secretary at the time, said he didn't know it was a sinkhole, which was why he didn't tell Gov. Rick Scott about it until Sept. 16, 2016, the day after it hit the news. (Scott’s office confirmed to PolitiFact that he learned about it on that day.) ""I knew at the time in late August that there was a water loss incident,"" Steverson told reporters weeks later. ""I was not aware of the sinkhole until a much later point in time."" Not announcing the incident, which was allowed under the law at the time, is not the same as a ""cover up,"" which could imply that state officials and Scott schemed to hide the information. Mosaic apologized for not notifying the public sooner. Once Scott was notified, he took action during the next couple of weeks. Responding to criticism from Graham at the time, Scott spokeswoman Jackie Schutz told the Tampa Bay Times that Scott had directed the DEP to expedite its investigation and asked the Florida Department of Health to work with DEP to ensure drinking water was safe. Scott initially defended his agency by saying state law didn’t require DEP to notify anyone unless the pollution left Mosaic’s property. ""Within 24 hours after they (the DEP) were notified, they started the investigation,'' Scott said Sept. 22. ""If somebody's done anything wrong, we're going to hold them accountable.'' But days later, Scott declared the law ""outdated"" and announced a temporary emergency rule that included 24-hour public notification requirements. He also vowed to propose legislation for the upcoming session that would make such a policy permanent. ""I am demanding any business, county or city government responsible for a pollution incident to immediately tell the public,"" Scott said. ""That is common sense and our residents deserve that."" A judge later said that the Legislature would have to set such a rule change, and it did just that in 2017 when it unanimously passed a bill signed into law by Scott. Steverson, who was Scott’s pick to lead the department, quit a few months after news about the sinkhole broke.  Scott’s spokesman said Scott didn’t ask Steverson to step down. Mosaic said repairs were completed in June 2018. The state is reviewing the company’s report to ensure all repairs were effectively completed. After the story came out, Graham spread the word about it through statements to the media. Graham criticized the state’s response, called for an investigation and filed public records requests to Scott’s office and the environment protection department seeking electronic communications about the sinkhole. She received hundreds of pages of materials, but the communication between state officials was largely after the news broke. Graham raised questions about why the emails between state officials didn’t begin earlier. ""If this is the sum total of the communication that went on between DEP and the governor’s office over this massive potential contamination,"" Graham said, ""Florida families have a lot to be concerned about."" In her tweet’s accompanying Politico story, she was more nuanced about Scott’s role. ""I don’t know which is worse,"" Graham said in 2016. ""Either Gov. Rick Scott knew about the sinkhole and didn’t inform the public, or leadership at the Department of Environmental Protection is so irresponsible they didn’t alert the governor to a potential public health disaster."" Graham spokesman Matt Harringer didn’t point to any evidence that Scott himself had covered up the sinkhole, as her tweet indicates, but said his administration did and that the buck stops with the governor. ""It is completely fair to use ‘Rick Scott’ and ‘his administration’ synonymously,"" Harringer said. ""The governor is the ultimate head of the Department of Environmental Protection — and often takes credit for their actions."" Our review of her comments found that she more often pointed the finger more broadly at Scott’s administration or the Department of Environmental Protection. On Facebook in September 2016 she wrote: ""Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants — but the Florida Department of Environmental Protection has tried to keep a toxic sinkhole secret from the public. That's just wrong."" On an April 2018 press release on her campaign website she wrote, ""Graham has a record of holding Scott accountable for polluting Florida’s waters. In 2016, she launched a public records investigation to expose his administration’s role in covering up a toxic sinkhole."" But the July 18 tweet was not the only time that she blamed Scott for a cover up. The environment page on her campaign website states, ""When a massive toxic sinkhole opened up in Central Florida and state regulators tried to cover it up, Gwen fought for the public to know by exposing Governor Scott’s secrecy."" Graham said, ""When a sinkhole began dumping toxic water in Florida's aquifer, Rick Scott tried to cover it up."" She exaggerates by stating that Scott tried to cover up the sinkhole. News reports show that the head of the environmental protection department didn’t inform Scott until the media reported about it, which happened about three weeks after the sinkhole started. The department does not earn good marks for transparency: It initially labeled the sinkhole as a ""water loss incident"" and did not inform the public right away. But Graham goes too far in calling it an attempted cover up. Not announcing the incident was allowed under the law at the time. Graham’s tweet went further than past statements about the issue by squarely blaming Scott. The quick jab does not account for actions he took after he learned about the sinkhole, including an emergency order to change the notification rule and calling for a permanent law change about public notification (which he signed). Graham’s campaign now says that blaming Scott himself for the cover up is the same as blaming the administration. But the tweet should have been more precise",Mostly False,"August 1, 2018"
"The Black River’s water quality is ""rated at the very top in North Carolina.""","If hog farms were wrecking the environment in eastern North Carolina, a local river would be more polluted. That was the logic behind a recent statement by Steve Troxler, the state’s agriculture commissioner since 2005. Troxler was among several Republicans to speak at a rally on July 10 in Duplin County, in rural Eastern North Carolina. They attended the event to denounce a court ruling against Smithfield Foods, the world’s largest pork producer and a partner of many N.C. hog farmers. A jury recently awarded $25 million to an Eastern North Carolina couple after they complained that a Smithfield farm caused swarms of flies, bad smells and other nuisances on their property. Troxler called the ruling ""un-American"" and ""a travesty of justice."" And he expressed doubt about the extent of damage that hog farms cause. ""The Black River starts in Sampson County, runs through Duplin County right through hog country. And the water quality in that river is rated at the very top in North Carolina,"" Troxler said. ""Now, how can that be with all of the stories you’ve heard about environmental disasters associated with the hog industry in North Carolina? It’s just not true,"" he continued. ""But I think it goes back to the old adage that if you say it enough times, it must be true. So we have got to disprove that. We’ve got to educate, and we’ve got to talk about it."" During hurricanes and other big storms, hog waste sometimes runs into rivers in Eastern North Carolina. Farmers keep the waste in lagoons, or ponds, often to use for fertilizer. The lagoons can overflow during floods. The Black River is a 50-mile-long tributary of the Cape Fear River, which last year was ranked as one of America’s ""most endangered"" by the American Rivers environmental advocacy group. The group listed the threat of pollution from hog farms as their reason for concern. So PolitiFact wondered about the accuracy of Troxler’s claim about the Black River. Is its water quality ""rated at the very top"" in North Carolina? A state classification In an email, a spokeswoman for the state Agriculture Department cited Black River’s classification with the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality. The river is classified as a swamp that has ""outstanding resource water,"" meaning it has ""excellent water quality"" while ""being of exceptional state or national ecological or recreational significance."" It’s the highest classification the state offers. And only 900 of the 13,000 water bodies that DEQ examines — about 7 percent — have that label, according to Christy Simmons, a spokeswoman for DEQ. The department measures dissolved oxygen, pH, specific conductivity, water temperature, total suspended solids, turbidity and fecal coliform, among other things. Fecal coliform bacteria come from warm-blooded animals. While coliform bacteria won’t necessarily make you sick, their presence can be a sign the water is home to harmful pathogens. At two stations in the Black River, fecal coliform is elevated about 10 percent of the time, according to DEQ. The Black River doesn’t violate any of the department’s quality standards. However, DEQ doesn’t collect fecal coliform data frequently enough to assess the extent that fecal coliform growth exists and fluctuates in the river, DEQ spokeswoman Bridget Munger said. The ""true standard"" for measuring fecal coliform levels is to take five samples in a 30-day period, she said, but DEQ collects data only once a month. The lower part of the Black River ""is listed as data inconclusive due to low dissolved oxygen levels in this part of the river system,"" Munger said in an email. PolitiFact asked DEQ whether the Black River is, indeed, ranked as one of the state’s cleanest rivers. ""I don’t think we have the data to make this specific claim,"" Munger said. ""It doesn’t violate the water quality standards set for this stream. There are elevated nutrients and fecal coliform bacteria concentrations at times,"" Munger said. ""There is only a single major (wastewater treatment plant) upstream of the Black River but there are many animal feeding operations in the Black River watershed."" Lack of testing Thus, environmental advocates say the Black River’s ""outstanding resource water"" classification isn’t a true reflection of the river’s water quality. Part of the reason DEQ hasn’t found more pollution in the Black River is because it’s not properly looking for it and reporting it, said Grady McCallie, policy director at North Carolina Conservation Network. North Carolina doesn’t have standards for nitrogen and phosphorus in the water — which can cause illness. ""If we did, I suspect a lot of the rivers in hog country would show significant burdens of these pollutants. Because we don’t, we rely on chlorophyll-a, a pigment associated with algae, as a marker for too much nutrient pollution,"" McCallie said in an email. The problem with testing for that kind of algae is that it blooms only when the water slows down, he continued. ""That’s why you see significant impairment behind (a dam) on the Cape Fear, because the water slows down and the algae blooms. But as long as the Black River keeps flowing, the pollution is just carried down the river to cause problems downstream,"" McCallie said. Compounding issues, the state isn’t testing for a wide enough range of nutrients. ""Lots of nutrient pollution in the river could be messing up the ecology, but we also don’t have a ‘periphyton’ standard, which would measure whether we have the right kinds or too much algae on the bank and bottom of the river,"" McCallie said. ""EPA had previously recommended that North Carolina develop one, but we haven’t."" ‘Hogwash’ Michael Mallin, a research professor at UNC-Wilmington, has conducted research on eastern NC rivers and co-authored the 2016 report ""Environmental Assessment of the Lower Cape Fear River System."" At the time, Mallin noted high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus at three sites in the Black River. Mallin checks the nutrients monthly and ""often"" finds nitrogen and phosphorus levels to be higher than the level that scientists would consider healthy, he said in a phone interview. He called the Black River’s ORW classification ""outdated."" Ryke Longest, director of the Duke Environmental Law and Policy Clinic, went a step further. ""But the claim that this proves there are no water quality problems caused by hog farms is pure hogwash,"" Longest said in an email. ""The truth is the Black River may be much more polluted than we know because it lacks sufficient monitoring stations to check its status."" Longest, McCallie and Will Hendrick, staff attorney for the N.C. Waterkeeper Alliance, scoffed at Troxler’s suggestion that hog waste isn’t affecting the Black River and that the river’s water quality is among the state’s best. ""What Troxler is saying is that because it’s classified at the top, its quality is at the top. But just because you say the quality should be good at this place doesn’t mean it is,"" Hendrick said. ""It has the ORW classification. But that says nothing at all about the current water quality. Period."" Our rating Troxler cast doubt on the effect of hog farms, saying the Black River’s water ""is rated at the very top in North Carolina."" While the Black River has an ""outstanding"" designation with the state, its environmental regulatory agency says the label doesn’t mean the river is one of the cleanest in the state. And experts say the state probably would find other harmful nutrients — if only it tested for them",Half True,"August 1, 2018"
"Says Foxconn ""is under investigation in mainland China for securities fraud, environmental fraud and labor fraud.""","Ever since Gov. Scott Walker signed a $3 billion agreement with Taiwan-based Foxconn, the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer, the deal has been an object of controversy in Wisconsin politics. The complaints from Democratic gubernatorial candidates have ranged from the size of the deal to the cost per new job to the environmental impact of the plant. Matt Flynn, one of eight remaining hopefuls, offered a different one in an April 12, 2018, interview with Green Bay’s WFRV-TV. In the interview, Flynn claimed Foxconn ""is under investigation in mainland China for securities fraud, environmental fraud and labor fraud."" That's quite a lot of fraud. But is the claim itself fraudulent or on target? When we asked Flynn's campaign to provide backup for the claims, it cited several news articles detailing various investigations into Foxconn's activities. We made our own checks as well. All the articles cited refer to past investigations rather than ongoing ones, as claimed by Flynn, and they did not necessarily discover any instances of fraud. Additionally, most of the investigations cited were not official governmental reviews, as implied by Flynn’s statement. Rather, they were conducted by advocacy groups and media organizations. Let’s take a look at each of the areas Flynn cited. The environment Flynn said Foxconn is under investigation for environmental fraud. When asked for backup, his campaign cited a 2013 investigation by Chinese regulators  after allegations the electronics supplier had dumped heavy toxic metals into canals that lead to a nearby river. The campaign also cited another investigation, though this one was not government-led: Pressured by environmental groups, Apple in 2012 agreed to conduct independent environmental reviews of some of its suppliers, including Foxconn. Steph Tai, a professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School, framed it this way: An environmental violation is noncompliance with environmental law, whereas environmental fraud is concealing the fact of that noncompliance. They are different legal categories. But the boundary between the two categories is often hazy. Last year, a firm owned by Foxconn subsidiary FIH mobile in Hebei province’s Langfang city tried to stop the Chinese environment ministry's pollution inspectors from making checks during a nationwide investigation of more than 3,000 companies. Does this constitute violating environmental laws or environmental fraud? According to Tai, it could be both, because most operating permits require a company to allow inspectors inside. Preventing inspectors from making checks would thus violate the dictates of the permit. ""If this sounds like such claims could overlap a lot, don't worry,"" said Tai. ""They often do in these kinds of cases."" Flynn’s campaign disputed Tai’s definition of fraud, arguing that fraud encompasses a broader range of illegal activities than concealment. Labor A similar absence of government-led inquiries and legal ambiguities plague Flynn's claim on the subject of labor fraud. It is true that Foxconn has been investigated multiple times for alleged labor abuses, though none of the investigations were government-led. More importantly, none of the investigations are ongoing. Most recently, between August 2017 and April 2018, the U.S.-based advocacy group China Labor Watch investigated the Hengyang Foxconn plant in Hunan province, which primarily manufactures Amazon Echo Dot and Kindle devices. The group identified numerous labor violations, including excessive hours, low wages, and inadequate training. Peak production season saw employees putting in more than 100 overtime hours per month, far beyond the 36 hours allowed under Chinese law. In some instances, employees worked 14 consecutive days. About 40 percent of the workforce was comprised of ""dispatch"" workers (temporary, low-cost, agency-recruited staffers) -- far in excess of the 10 percent limit under Chinese law. Dispatch workers had limited pre-job safety training, underpaid overtime hours and unpaid sick leave. Still, China Labor Watch declined to identify these labor violations as labor fraud. ""I cannot say for certain whether our findings would constitute as labor fraud,"" said Winnie Shen, a program assistant at China Labor Watch, in an email. In 2012, the New York Times published an investigation into labor violations at Foxconn, including extended overtime and crowded living conditions for workers. It also documented multiple factory explosions caused by combustible aluminum dust, which had amassed in high concentrations due to poor ventilation. Later that year, an audit of three of Foxconn's Apple facilities and over 35,000 workers by the Fair Labor Association, a collaborative initiative between universities and businesses that promotes workers’ rights, unearthed labor abuses not dissimilar from those recently found by China Labor Watch. During peak production, employees worked an average number of hours that exceeded Chinese legal limits. The Fair Labor Association also found that 14 percent of workers potentially didn't receive fair compensation for unscheduled overtime. Later that year, Foxconn reached an agreement with Apple to improve conditions for millions of workers assembling iPhones and iPads. The FLA later confirmed Foxconn had improved working conditions ahead of schedule, though employees still described these measures as insufficient. The FLA’s report has also been subject to criticism.  Some other examples of Foxconn’s labor violations: In 2006, the British newspaper The Mail reported on extensive hours, low wages, crowded dorms and military-style drills. In 2010, a rash of workers committed suicide to raise awareness of poor labor conditions. Foxconn responded by pledging to improve working conditions and installing netting around dormitories to catch falling workers. In 2012, 150 employees at the company's Wuhan production facility threatened to commit suicide over a wage dispute. Whether the company's persistent violations of Chinese labor law constitutes fraud is the question. ""To me, fraud does not seem like the right word,"" said Mary Gallagher, director of the Lieberthal-Rogel Center for Chinese Studies at the University of Michigan. She noted that an example of fraud would be ""keeping two sets of working time reports, so that it appears to be no violations of overtime."" Again, however, the Flynn campaign argued that fraud encompasses a broader range of illegal activities than concealment. Securities In this case, the Flynn campaign did cite an official government investigation: an initial public offering (IPO) review of the company conducted by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, which scrutinized all of Foxconn’s present and past transactions. Such reviews are part of the standard procedure for being granted an IPO. As such, Flynn’s statement is misleading because it implies that Foxconn was investigated for a specific legal breach rather than as part of a standard procedure. The first statement suggests malice, the second suggests nothing. Moreso, the Chinese securities regulatory investigation concluded on March 8, 2018. Flynn made his claim on April 12. As such, Foxconn would not have been under investigation for securities fraud at the time he made his statement, as he implied. Although not cited by the Flynn campaign, reports show Foxconn has been investigated for bribery. In 2013, authorities in Taiwan investigated allegations that Foxconn Technology employees had accepted bribes from the company's supply-chain partners. They eventually detained several former executives. According to Foxconn, it had requested an investigation from authorities after an internal audit uncovered a few violations -- though the company insisted these violations were limited in scope. So while Chinese authorities did briefly look into Foxconn for alleged bribery, the scope of the investigation was extremely limited, and it is not clear that it found any instances of securities violations, let alone securities fraud. The Flynn campaign also cited two blog posts that described questionable business practices at Foxconn. But neither related to a formal investigation, let alone an ongoing one. As for Foxconn, the company issued a statement to us that read: ""Foxconn can state that there is no truth to the claim made by Mr. Flynn regarding our company’s operations in China. Foxconn is committed to fulfilling our responsibilities as a global industry leader and good corporate citizen.  As part of that commitment, Foxconn works hard to ensure we comply with all relevant laws and regulations in all markets where we operate."" Our rating Flynn claimed that Foxconn ""is under investigation in mainland China for securities fraud, labor fraud and environmental fraud."" 
But all of the investigations cited by Flynn are old. The violations uncovered by some do not necessarily constitute fraud, while a few others did not find any violations at all. Much of the evidence cited comes from outside groups, including advocacy groups and even media companies, rather than the government",Mostly False,"July 31, 2018"
"Says ""political interference"" from Scott Walker’s administration has led to ""gagging (DNR) scientists so they can no longer comment on proposed legislation"" and ""we’re letting polluters write their own permits.""","Republican Gov. Scott Walker has made headlines for years with his initiatives to ease regulatory burdens in the state after declaring during his Jan 3, 2011, inaugural address that ""Wisconsin is open for business."" But has the Walker administration gone so far as to prevent Department of Natural Resources scientists from commenting on proposed legislation, and letting corporations draft their own permits? That was the claim from former state Rep. Kelda Roys, one of eight Democrats hoping to face Walker in the November 2018 election. In a May 2, 2018, interview with journalist Steve Walters of WisconsinEye, Roys claimed ""political interference"" from Walker’s administration has led to ""gagging (DNR) scientists so they can no longer comment on proposed legislation."" And, ""We're letting polluters write their own permits."" Let’s take a look at both parts of Roys’ claim. The changing role of DNR in legislation When asked for backup on the ""gagging"" part of the claim, the Roys campaign provided three news articles. Two (Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and Isthmus) reported a case in which DNR testimony was absent from a legislative hearing regarding chronic wasting disease and the baiting/feeding of white-tailed deer. The other, from Scientific American, carried this headline: ""How Scott Walker dismantled Wisconsin's environmental legacy."" In the March 23, 2017, Isthmus article, DNR Deputy Secretary Kurt Thiede is quoted as saying: ""The department does not take positions for or against legislation. When requested, the department appears at the public hearing for informational purposes when requested by either a committee chairman or a bill’s primary author. This has been administration policy since 2011."" When asked to comment, the Walker campaign referred us to the Republican Party of Wisconsin, which cited numerous instances where the department was asked to testify -- for information only -- at legislative hearings during Walker’s administration: Assembly Bills 160, 203, and 668, and Senate Bills 228 and 368 among them. DNR communications director Jim Dick said since February 15, 2017, DNR staff have given informational testimony on 30 different topics during legislative hearings, met with legislators and/or their staff about once a week, and have fielded about 40 calls or emails a week to answer questions from lawmakers on various topics. ""In a three-year period (2014-2017),"" said Dick, ""we received and responded to more than 6,000 legislative inquiries. DNR staff does communicate with legislators and legislative staff frequently. But it is not our role to offer our opinion on whether a particular piece of legislation is right or wrong, good or bad."" Still, the policy marks a change from the pre-Walker era. Tom Hauge, who retired in 2016 after serving 25 years as wildlife director for the department, said staffers had more latitude in the past. At any and every relevant hearing, he said, experts from the department would testify alongside the department’s legislative liaison, taking a stand on whether the agency supported, opposed, or was neutral toward the proposed legislation. If they found that the legislation would have negative impact — ""I don’t just mean trivial,"" he added — they would take an official position in opposition at the hearings. Shifting DNR’s role to an invite-only, information-only basis hasn’t necessarily reduced its  participation in legislative hearings, as the earlier numbers show. But there’s no guarantee that they will be asked to attend. For instance, the DNR was noticeably uninvited to the March 2017 hearing on Assembly Bill 61 which would lighten rules that prohibit baiting/feeding deer in counties with documented chronic wasting disease. Hauge, then retired, attended as a private citizen; reports said he fielded questions from interested lawmakers for nearly half an hour after giving his testimony. So, DNR staffers have not been ""gagged,"" in that they continue to testify at hearings and provide information to lawmakers. But under Walker administration policy they cannot go beyond ""providing information"" in their statements and can’t even do that unless explicitly invited. The role of permitted entities in their own permitting On the issue of ""polluters writing their own permits,"" the Roys campaign sent two Wisconsin State Journal articles, but only one was on point. And in that article, the DNR explicitly denied accusations that ""polluters"" (in this case, dairy producers) will be allowed to write their own permits under Walker-administration initiatives aimed at moving the burden of permit-related paperwork to credentialed contractors. After our own digging, we found that desires to ""streamline"" permitting were among many changes included in DNR’s ""strategic alignment plan,"" which was announced in November 2016 by then-DNR secretary Cathy Stepp. A Nov 30, 2016, article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel covered the announcement, saying: ""The DNR will develop a program to turn over some time-consuming tasks of permit writing to experts in the private sector who are hired by a property owner or business seeking the permit. The agency plans to set benchmarks so that officials reviewing the permits can be assured that information they get from the consultants is accurate."" The article also said: ""The DNR will still write final permits, but will develop so-called ‘assurance programs’ so they can rely more on the accuracy of information provided by private parties. The new approach on permits is part of a series of organizational changes officials say will make the agency more efficient at a time when its workforce has shrunk to a 30-year low."" Did these plans become a reality? Changes to wetland permits were the first major change under Walker, with the introduction of the ""assured delineator"" program. This initiative encourages project planners to hire consultants to mark wetlands for which construction would be prohibited or require mitigation, prior to applying for a permit. Dick, the department spokesman, told us the DNR announced plans in 2016 for similar ""assurance programs"" that would allow large dairy producers to hire private contractors to work on their pollution permit applications. But, he noted, the program hasn’t been implemented yet. And the DNR is now in discussions about moving the entire program to the Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection, so ""the plan is not likely to be implemented anytime soon, if at all."" Sarah Geers, staff attorney for Midwest Environmental Advocates, works to watchdog DNR’s implementation and enforcement of environmental laws. Her take on permitting matched Dick’s. So, various changes were proposed that would have allowed permit applicants to hire contractors to complete major parts of the permit applications. But saying the plan allows polluters to write their own permits goes too far -- especially since the programs have not been implemented. Our rating Roys said ""political interference"" from Scott Walker’s administration has led to ""gagging (DNR) scientists so they can no longer comment on proposed legislation"" and ""we’re letting polluters write their own permits."" As for the Walker administration, DNR scientists are permitted to share their expertise regarding proposed legislation -- without declaring a position or commenting on the legislation itself -- by invitation only. The evidence suggests this still happens frequently, though pre-Walker staffers had more latitude in what they could say. As for the second half of Roys’ statement, Walker has taken steps to change permit-writing processes so that businesses are more involved (and DNR officials less involved). But the plans have not come to fruition, and even if they did, responsibility would shift to ""assured contractors"" and would not occur in-house with those Roys labeled the ""polluters",Mostly False,"July 27, 2018"
"Says Adam Putnam ""backed a water bill that gutted water quality regulations.""","The toxic green algae bloom spreading across Lake Okeechobee has seeped into the state’s political races, including Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam's quest for Florida governor. The Democratic Governors Association slammed Putnam, a Republican, in a July 10 press release, saying he cheered on weakened water quality regulations and lax oversight that they say contributed to the mess in Lake Okeechobee.   The Democrats further pushed the point on ""Algae Adam"" in a Medium post-July 13: ""As Agriculture Commissioner, Putnam backed a water bill that gutted water quality regulations."" Did Putnam back a bill that ""gutted"" water regulations, and what does that have to do with the toxic situation in Lake Okeechobee? Putnam backed a bill in 2016 that changed the oversight of water quality conditions across the state. Supporters of the measure say the law was crafted to try and reduce pollution and improve water quality. Environmentalists say the law ended up doing the opposite. For years, pollutants such as fertilizers, pesticides and human and animal waste have been pumped into Florida’s springs and water resources. SB 552, signed into law by Gov. Rick Scott in 2016, came about as a way to address the pollution and over-pumping, including at Lake Okeechobee, though whether it helps the situation is debated. The measure, among other things, required the Department of Environmental Protection to define the standard for what counts as ""harmful to the water resources;"" revised Florida statutes so that there would be stricter requirements for certain sized wells; and required that water management districts adopt recovery and prevention policies. It also established water-flow levels for springs.  The bill overwhelmingly passed both chambers of the Legislature with just two dissenting votes from House Democrats. Putnam did not have a vote, but he did vouch for the bill. (Putnam also supported a very similar piece of legislation, HB 7003, in 2015.) ""This builds on Florida's strong tradition of water policy that dates back to the early '70s,"" Putnam told reporters at the time. ""And it won't be the end. I think there are things we need to continue to do but in that march toward progress. This appears to be moving and I hope it goes all the way, unlike last year."" One of the primary concerns with the new law is that it did not create clear-cut standards for water quality monitoring. Under the new law, polluting farms can meet standards by adhering to Best Management Practices, such as building fences to keep animals out waterways. But environmentalists said that there are steps the bill could have taken when it comes to monitoring these farms, like involving the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Instead of giving more power to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to cut back on pollution, the bill put more oversight into the hands of Putnam's Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. Environmentalists said this amounts to voluntary pollution control strategies, rather than the concrete monitoring program they wanted to see. This provision impacts Lake Okeechobee water quality because the algae bloom covering the lake is in part caused by excess nitrates in agricultural run-off. ""The 2016 water bill did effectively ‘gut water regulations,’ "" said Kimberly Mitchell, the executive director of the Everglades Trust. ""Before that, water management districts were allowed to implement pollution controls more broadly."" More than 100 environmental organizations and businesses wrote to legislators, outlining criticisms and proposing 13 amendments. As an example, they singled out a provision for monitoring consumptive water permits. The law requires consumptive use permits for pipes with an ""inside diameter of 8 inches or more."" Before this, utilities had to have a consumptive use permit for more pipes under 8 inches, too. The Democratic Governors Association said Putnam ""backed a water bill that gutted water quality regulations."" There's no doubt that Putnam supported a bipartisan law that made changes to state water policy. But the group's attack ignores the regulations and procedures that remain in place. This statement is partially accurate",Half True,"July 18, 2018"
"""Foxconn will not face oversight from any federal, state, or local agency to guarantee it complies with our wetlands protection laws.""","The $10 billion Foxconn project recently broke ground with much fanfare in Mount Pleasant, Wis. The project, which Republican Gov. Scott Walker helped woo to Wisconsin with the help of a state and local incentive package of about $4 billion, has been a political lightning rod. Supporters have hailed the prospect of 13,000 new jobs and the related economic impact on the state. Opponents have assailed the state’s tax incentive package, arguing the money could be better spent on road improvements, education and health care. They have also criticized the company’s need to divert millions of gallons of water a day from Lake Michigan. Some of the most prominent objections have focused on the potential environmental impact of the project, including potential air pollution and wetlands loss.   Matt Flynn, one of several Democratic candidates vying to take on Walker in the Nov. 6, 2018,  general election, voiced his concerns in a June 13, 2018 news release: ""As I have said before, Foxconn is welcome to build its factory in Wisconsin and create jobs here, but not under the terms of Scott Walker's costly, corrupt, and unconstitutional deal. As governor, I will not allow Foxconn to take our tax dollars or circumvent the laws everyone else has to follow."" He added this claim, which is one we want to check: ""Foxconn will not face oversight from any federal, state, or local agency to guarantee it complies with our wetlands protection laws."" The evidence When asked to provide support for the wetlands statement, Flynn campaign manager Bryan Kennedy pointed PolitiFact to a Jan. 3, 2018, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article, which begins this way: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers says it has no jurisdiction over wetlands that will be filled as part of Foxconn Technology Group’s plans for a massive electronics plant in rural Racine County. The Corps’ decision could help hasten construction by removing a potential roadblock for construction of the $10 billion plant, which would have allowed for the public to offer comments on the permit and potentially push for changes in how the site is developed to avoid wetlands. Wisconsin lawmakers changed state law in September to accommodate the company by giving up state authority over wetlands on the Foxconn property. The Corps, however, still had the power to weigh in on the project. The legislation also exempted Foxconn from some environmental requirements, allowing the company to fill in wetlands that are regulated by the state and change the course of streams. So, the paragraphs from the article are mostly -- but not entirely -- on target with Flynn’s claim. However, further down, the article notes: ""While the state would allow Foxconn to fill wetlands, that loss would require that new wetlands be created. Under existing law, for every 1 acre lost, a developer must create 1.2 acres elsewhere. The Foxconn legislation requires greater mitigation — 2 acres for every 1 acre lost."" So, there are other environmental regulations at play. State Department of Natural Resources In short, there are some things the state has given up. But that does not mean there is no oversight on wetlands, as Flynn claims. The company has to replace the wetlands -- and do so at a higher ratio than other companies that are allowed to fill in wetlands. This is all covered in a $2 million ""in lieu"" fee that is part of the agreement. Foxconn paid the amount into the Wisconsin Wetland Conservation Trust, according to an April 25, 2018, state Department of Natural Resources letter. The in-lieu fee program, according to the DNR, involves the restoration, establishment, enhancement and/or preservation of aquatic resources through funds paid to a government or non-profit natural resources management entity to satisfy compensatory mitigation requirements of permits. In a separate reference to its oversight, the state DNR Wisconsin Wetland Conservation Trust document stated the agency will oversee third-party construction of wetlands as paid for by Foxconn’s fee. DNR communications director Jim Dick said in an email that a total of 16.64 wetland acres under state jurisdiction were delineated in the area of Phase 1 of the Foxconn project. Thus, the $2 million would be used to create at least 33.28 acres of new wetlands. The expectation, he said, is that the new wetland areas will be created in the same watersheds affected by the loss of existing wetlands. The DNR website states ""Foxconn is subject to federal wetland permitting requirements and must properly mitigate any impact on wetlands."" Officials from Foxconn and Walker’s office both cited the same 2:1 ratio and $2 million payment by the company. Our rating In a news release, Flynn said ""Foxconn will not face oversight from any federal, state, or local agency to guarantee it complies with our wetlands protection laws."" The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced that ""it has no jurisdiction,"" but the state Department of Natural Resources says ""Foxconn is subject to federal wetland permitting requirements and must properly mitigate any impact on wetlands."" Indeed, Foxconn is required to mitigate wetlands at a higher ratio than other companies in the state. The bottomline: While some environmental oversight was removed, Flynn’s claim went beyond that to say there would be no oversight related to wetlands",Mostly False,"July 11, 2018"
"Says he ""actually wrote the bipartisan law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida’s coast.""","A new ad in Florida’s hotly contested Senate race portrays a clear distinction between Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican opponent Gov. Rick Scott when it comes to their record on offshore oil drilling. The ad accuses the term-limited governor of supporting offshore drilling even after the BP oil spill and claims that Scott’s January meeting about drilling with Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke was nothing more than a ""political stunt."" Then the ad by Nelson shifts to his record. ""Bill Nelson actually wrote the bipartisan law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida’s coast,"" the text on the screen says. We’ve already taken a close look at Scott’s record on oil drilling when we gave him Full Flop in January. We found that Scott clearly campaigned in 2010 on expanding oil drilling. But that changed around the time of the meeting with Zinke. This time, we wanted to hone in on Nelson’s legislative record. Did Nelson actually write the law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida’s coast?   Environmental experts said Nelson deserves credit for protecting Florida’s Gulf Coast, but the legislation that actually was signed into law didn’t have Nelson’s name on it. Still, based on news reporting at that time, it was clear that Nelson’s bill (and the Republican who co-sponsored it) was the inspiration for the law that enacted a moratorium on drilling on the Gulf Coast. In 2006, Nelson teamed up with former Florida Republican Sen. Mel Martinez to cosponsor a piece of legislation known as the Permanent Protection for Florida Act of 2006 (S.2239). That bill aimed to prohibit offshore drilling on the outer Continental Shelf near Florida. Specifically, the bill put a moratorium on issuing a lease for the exploration, development, or production of oil, natural gas, or any other mineral off much of the coast of Florida until June 30, 2020. Frank Jackalone, the director of Florida chapter of the Sierra Club, praised Nelson and Martinez when the bill was introduced. (The Sierra Club endorsed Nelson). ""Last week our Florida senators introduced legislation that would head off these threats by providing permanent protection for Florida’s coasts and extended protection for the remaining moratoria areas,"" Jackalone said in a speech he gave at the time ""... He and Senator Nelson have given us a wonderful example of bipartisan leadership that puts Florida’s economy and environment first.""   That bill was introduced in the Senate but did not get a hearing and never made it to law. So can Nelson really take credit for signing the bipartisan law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida’s coast? Although Nelson and Martinez’s legislation was not signed into law, similar ideas were included in a section of another bill known as the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (S.3711), which was sponsored by former Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M. That bill enacted a moratorium on drilling within 230 miles of Tampa Bay and 125 miles from the Panhandle until June 2022, among other things. It was signed into law Dec. 20, 2006. The bill didn’t have Nelson’s name on it, but each bill aimed to protect Florida’s Gulf Coast for oil drilling by placing a moratorium on issuing a lease for the exploration, development, or production of oil, natural gas, or any other mineral. Alyson Flournoy, a law professor at the University of Florida, said that if the language of Nelson’s bill was included in the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, we would treat Nelson as the author of that part of the law. We compared the text of Nelson and Martinez’s bill with the text from the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 to get a better look at the similarities between the two measures. The language in the 2006 Energy Act is not a carbon copy of Nelson’s bill, but conveys very similar ideas, especially about where drilling would be prohibited. For example, Nelson and Martinez’s bill defined the area off limits as the Florida exclusion zone. That area included: 25 miles west of the Military Mission Line, 150 miles off the Florida Panhandle, including the area commonly known as the ""Stovepipe’"" in the Gulf of Mexico, and 150 miles off the Florida east coast. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 enacted the moratorium on any area east of the Military Mission Line in the Gulf of Mexico; any area in the Eastern Planning Area that is within 125 miles of the coastline of the State of Florida and part of the Central Planning Area that is in middle of the Gulf of Mexico.  So, Nelson’s bill isn’t the exact same language, but newspaper outlets at the time said that Nelson and Martinez worked together to make sure the Gulf of Mexico was protected from oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006. ""Florida's U.S. senators, Democrat Bill Nelson and Republican Mel Martinez, had helped craft the bill, and both voted for it this morning,"" the St. Petersburg Times wrote in 2006. ""Martinez, who negotiated the measure with input from Nelson, rebuffed suggestions that the delegation could successfully maintain its 'no drilling' stance,"" the Miami Herald wrote after the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act passed the House. Days before the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 was signed in to law. Martinez attended a press conference to speak about it. ""Nelson and I, both from Florida, have had longstanding concerns about protections we felt were necessary for Florida's fragile environment and also because of our very strong economies derived from tourism, that our coastal waters and beaches be protected,"" Martinez said. ""For that reason, the features of this bill that are attractive to us is the zone of protection that it creates for Florida along the Gulf Coast while at the same time permitting this very important additional exploration to take place."" Environmental experts agreed that Nelson deserves credit for writing the bipartisan law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida’s Gulf coast. ""Nelson out of anybody has the right to brag about being the gatekeeper on the Eastern Gulf,"" said Julie Wraithmell, the executive director of Audubon Florida. ""If it wasn’t for him, we really would have struggled."" A campaign ad paid for by Nelson said he ""actually wrote the bipartisan law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida’s coast."" The ad writers should be more careful with their language. Nelson co-sponsored legislation in 2006 that would have banned drilling off Florida’s coast. That measure was never signed in to law, but similar ideas were included in the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, which, among other things, enacted a moratorium on drilling 125 miles of the eastern portion of the Gulf of Mexico until June 2022. According to news reports at that time, Nelson and Martinez negotiated and worked to make sure Florida’s Gulf Coast was protected under with the 2006 act. And even though the law was not an exact copy, environmental experts agreed that Nelson deserves credit for writing the bipartisan law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida’s Gulf coast",Mostly True,"June 29, 2018"
"""The science is clear, under President Trump greenhouse gas emissions are down.""","On the campaign trail and as president, Donald Trump has expressed his skepticism about global warming. So it was a bit of a surprise when a reader asked us to check a statement issued by his Environmental Protection Agency that touted the administration’s record in reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, which scientists say are the main driver of global warming. ""The science is clear, under President Trump greenhouse gas emissions are down, Superfund sites are being cleaned up at a higher rate than under President Obama, and the federal government is investing more money to improve water infrastructure than ever before,"" the EPA said in a statement when contacted for a June 13 article by Bloomberg titled, ""Researchers Argue Proposed EPA Changes Could Cause 80,000 More Deaths a Decade."" Here, we’ll focus on the first assertion in the EPA’s statement — that ""the science is clear, under President Trump greenhouse gas emissions are down."" We found that to be a stretch. When we asked the EPA for supporting evidence, they pointed us to a report titled, ""Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks."" This includes data collected and released regularly by the EPA, most recently in April 2018. The report found that the amount of greenhouse emissions by the United States fell in the most recent year. But there’s a problem: Due to the lag in data collection, that decline occurred during President Barack Obama’s final year in office, 2016, not under Trump. Here’s a chart of the EPA data on greenhouse gas emissions between 1990 and 2016, most of which consisted of carbon dioxide: We found other data sets that more directly address the Trump era. The first is a comprehensive study issued every year by the energy company BP, called the Statistical Review of World Energy. It uses a different methodology but produced similar findings as the EPA data — a 0.5 percent decline in emissions for the United States in 2017 (Trump’s first year) over 2016 (Obama’s last). The study found that it was the third consecutive year that emissions in the United States had declined, ""though the fall was the smallest over the last three years."" In other words, emissions declined under Trump, but the rate of decline slowed compared to the late Obama era. (The BP study was released on the same day as Bloomberg published the EPA statement, so it’s not clear that the agency could have known about it when it made its statement.) A second set of data from the Energy Information Administration, a data-collecting unit of the federal Energy Department, showed a similar pattern. The EIA data covers 2017 and the first two months of 2018. However, it totals only the emissions from the energy sector, which is a significant source of emissions, but not the only one. Like the BP report, EIA found that that carbon emissions from energy declined between 2016 and 2017. But the annual decline slowed on Trump’s watch in the EIA data, too. In 2017, when Trump was president, emissions fell by less than 1 percent. That was a smaller decrease than for either of Obama’s final two years. In 2016, emissions fell by 1.64 percent from their 2015 level, and for 2015, they fell by 2.68 percent over their 2014 level. In addition, the EIA estimated that emissions will actually rise over the next two years. In 2018, the agency forecasts a 1.1 percent increase, and in 2019, it projects a 0.2 percent increase. The following chart shows annual declines in emissions almost every year from 2007 to 2017, followed by EIA’s projected increases for 2018 and 2019. Meanwhile, if you look at the EIA data on a monthly basis, emissions have moved in a fairly narrow band in 2016, 2017 and 2018, with emissions actually higher in January 2018 than they were in January 2016 under Obama. Here’s the chart showing monthly data. Bottom line: Emissions did fall in Trump’s first year, but the rate of decline slowed compared to the Obama era. Whatever impact Trump’s policies may ultimately have, their environmental impact won’t show up much in the data over such a short period. ""Most variations in emissions are due to the combination of long-term trends in energy use and efficiency and short-term variations in weather, with exceptional winter cold or summer heat leading to increased energy use and resulting in increased carbon dioxide emissions,"" said John Nielsen-Gammon, a Texas A&M University atmospheric sciences professor. One example of a long-term shift would be the transition from coal to natural gas in electricity generation, said John Reilly, co-director of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change at the MIT Sloan School of Management. The shift to natural gas has been driven by competitive pricing, greater access to natural gas supplies, and changing long-term environmental strategies by utilities. Other factors that could have had an impact include falling prices for renewable energy, consumer preferences for lower-emission power, and Congress’ extension of tax credits for renewable energy resources, according to the Environmental Defense Fund, an environmental group. The second reason for skepticism is that, whatever the merits of Trump’s policies in other ways, his signature policies are eventually expected to increase carbon emissions, not lower them. ""His stated goals are to increase coal use,"" Reilly said. ""His proposed plan to keep coal and nuclear plants from shutting down would have the opposite effect on emissions"" from what the EPA touted in its statement. Trump’s effort to roll back fuel vehicle standards would also tend to boost emission levels, though this initiative is so new that it hasn’t had an impact on the data yet. Experts credited Obama for policies and investments over eight years that nudged some utilities toward lower-emission fuels. ""This is the result of actions of the previous administration, and perhaps even more importantly, of economic and technological progress that are making renewables cheaper than fossil fuels,"" said Robert J. Brecha, a professor in the department of physics and the renewable and clean energy program at the University of Dayton. Some utilities have stated that they will be continuing the emissions-reducing efforts they began under Obama, including American Electric Power Co., Duke Energy, Southern Co., and Xcel Energy. The EPA said, ""The science is clear, under President Trump greenhouse gas emissions are down."" Emissions did fall slightly between 2016 and 2017. But the rate of decline slowed under Trump and the month-to-month changes have been modest. Whatever decline has occurred on Trump’s watch is unlikely to stem from his own policies. Changes to emissions levels tend to come either from changing economic incentives, government policy over the long term, and factors beyond human control, such as the weather",Half True,"June 18, 2018"
"Says most of Austin’s biggest parks have recycling though as ""many as 293 out of 300"" Austin city ""parks have no recycling, including almost every neighborhood park.""","Despite’s Austin’s ""zero-waste"" commitment, an advocacy group says that nearly every city park lacks recycling. We wondered about that declaration by the Texas Campaign for the Environment, which describes itself as the state’s largest environmental group organizing support through door-to-door canvassing. An April 2018 handout from the group notes that the city adopted a zero-waste commitment in 2011 requiring businesses and landlords to provide recycling. The city has a goal of reducing trash sent to landfills by 90 percent by 2040. ""Unfortunately,"" the TCE handout says, the ""zero-waste"" requirement ""does not apply to city government operations"" and parks rank among big missed opportunities. ""As many as 293 out of 300 parks have no recycling, including almost every neighborhood park,"" the handout says. There’s also good news, the handout says, in that the city has launched recycling in every recreation and cultural center and in most of Austin’s biggest parks. Still, 293 of 300 parks, including nearly every neighborhood park, have no recycling? By email, Andrew Dobbs, the group’s Central Texas program director, said he based his statement on an April 2018 city staff presentation to Austin’s Parks and Recreation Board. A slide in the presentation says the city has 300 parks. Two subsequent slides say a pilot program has introduced recycling to Zilker, Town Lake, Walnut Creek, Bull Creek and Ramsay parks plus Walsh Boat Landing. Other slides say recycling also has been added to more than five city swimming pools, five of six city golf courses and two softball complexes. Dobbs told us the campaign knows of one other park with recycling bins thanks to a neighborhood association. The group’s handout, Dobbs said, says ""as many as 293 out of 300"" parks have no recycling ""because we aren’t 100% certain if other parks might have recycling added on an ad hoc basis."" Records show Austin’s Parks and Recreation Department made the recycling presentation to two city boards. By phone, we separately confirmed TCE’s count of parks without recycling from Charles Vaclavik, a parks department official, who told us that plans are in motion next to expand recycling mostly along the south side of Lady Bird Lake through Roy G. Guerrero Colorado River Park. Vaclavik said Austin’s parks-with-recycling count would be higher if the department had started its pilot recycling program in 2017 by concentrating on small neighborhood parks rather than installing recycling bins in large ""metropolitan"" parks the city’s jewel, 351-acre Zilker Park. ""We concentrated (instead) on the activity centers that have the most people,"" Vaclavik said, seeking a ""bigger bang for the buck."" To date, he said, the recycling pilot has diverted about 35 percent of materials previously destined to move from trash cans to a landfill. Another factor: The city has yet to budget for recycling in its parks. Liana Kallivoka, the department’s assistant director, told the city’s Zero Waste Advisory Commission at its April 11, 2018, meeting that department officials were drafting a request for $250,000 in recycling-specific funding in the next city budget. If approved by the Austin City Council, Kallivoka said, the money would fund a program coordinator and hundreds of pairs of waste-recycling receptacles with tops, which run $1,100 each, to follow on 150 pairs already installed in park facilities and outdoors. Shelley Parks, a city spokeswoman, told us by phone that the cost of the installed bins was covered largely by donors including the Austin Parks Foundation, the Trail Foundation, neighborhood associations and the office of City Council Member Alison Alter, who represents District 10. Generally, Kallivoka told the commission, the department’s goal is to extend recycling to all parks and facilities in three phases wrapping up with the addition of recycling to neighborhood parks. Commission members approved a resolution calling for the city to create a Parks & Recreation Recycling Task Force. The resolution says, in part, that ""approximately 4 of 300 City of Austin parks and 14 of 51 City of Austin aquatic facilities currently provide recycling opportunities."" Austin’s Parks and Recreation Board voted to urge creation of the same task force at its April 24, 2018, meeting. Dobbs also spoke to the commission, saying: ""The good news is that we’re at a point where everybody wants to do this."" Our ruling TCE’s handout says that most of Austin’s biggest parks have recycling though as ""many as 293 out of 300"" Austin city ""parks have no recycling, including almost every neighborhood park."" City figures support this analysis. The city hasn’t funded a parks recycling program",True,"June 8, 2018"
"""New law (in California) makes it illegal to shower and do laundry on same day""","A new fury is circulating on social media over two water conservation laws signed by California Gov. Jerry Brown. The legislation imposes new restrictions on water use as California recovers from a historic five-year drought that ended in April 2017. But several reports inaccurately stated that the laws would punish state residents who use too much water in their everyday routine. ""New law makes it illegal to shower and do laundry on same day,"" said a June 5, 2018, headline from the Federalist Papers Project, a conservative website that has peddled falsehoods before. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Federalist Papers Project story references a similar post from conservative website Breitbart, but seems to have gathered most of its information from an article on The Organic Prepper, a blog devoted to ""preparedness, health, frugality and food,"" according to its about page. Several other websites reposted The Organic Prepper’s report or wrote similar articles. Even U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., seemed to push the false narrative online. In a blog post, Nunes wrote, ""Californians don’t want to have to choose between doing their laundry and taking a shower, but that’s the kind of choice being forced on us."" The false reports center on two bills — Senate Bill 606 and Assembly Bill 1668 — that Brown signed into law May 31, 2018. Broadly speaking, the bills instruct cities, water districts and some larger agricultural water districts to establish strict water budgets. But the Federalist Papers Project story said the bills would limit California residents to 55 gallons of indoor water use per person per day, beginning in 2022. Violators who use more water than allowed, the story went, would be fined $1,000 per day during normal seasons and $10,000 per day during drought emergencies.   The story said this limit ""will turn the most honest, law abiding residents of California into lawbreakers"" by making it illegal to take a shower and run a load of laundry in a single day. Here, the Federalist Papers Project borrowed calculations from The Organic Prepper’s story, which said the average shower and laundry load use 17 and 40 gallons of water, respectively, for a total of 57 daily gallons — two more gallons than would be allowed were California residents actually limited to 55 gallons of indoor water use per day. But that is where the Federalist Papers Project got it wrong: Under the new legislation, Californians will not actually be penalized on an individual basis for excessive water use. In reality, the bills stipulate that cities, water districts and large agricultural water districts must come up with budgetary targets for water use by 2022. They will then need to meet their targets across their ratepayer bases, with failure to do so resulting in a fine of $1,000 per day or $10,000 per day during drought emergencies.   George Kostyrko, director of the office of public affairs for the State Water Resources Control Board, told us the water districts will be guided in their target-setting by three standards, one of which is the allowance of 55 gallons per capita per day for indoor residential water use — a number that will drop to 50 gallons by 2030. The other standards, both yet to be determined, will place similar caps on outdoor residential water use and water loss due to system leaks. ""Unfortunately some media outlets have grossly misinterpreted the law,"" Kostyrko said. ""These are not individual mandates for homeowners, but actually a task given to each water district to average water consumption use out to hit the goal."" Jim Metropulos, legislative director for state Assemblywoman Laura Friedman, who wrote Assembly Bill 1668, explained that the legislation ""sets water efficiency goals for water districts and municipalities on the territorial level, but it does not regulate what individual Californians or businesses can and can’t do."" ""There is nothing in this bill to target households or companies,"" Metropulos wrote in an email. ""Water use objectives are on territory-level of a water agency. There is nothing regulating the time a person may shower or when they may or may not do laundry."" This means that the Federalist Papers Project story was wrong to suggest that water use would be assessed on a daily individual basis. ""The new requirements are for water districts, not individuals,"" said Katie Hanzlik, press secretary for state Sen. Robert Hertzberg, who authored Senate Bill 606. ""And the number is based on average water use."" Fines based on consumption will actually be administered to the water agencies that fail to meet their targets, rather than individuals who use too much water on a given day. And while a water district could theoretically let those costs shift to individual water bills, any increase in costs assumed by ratepayers would be closer to a few bucks than $1,000. For the record, it is also worth noting that washing machines are more efficient than they used to be, which calls into question some of the water-use estimates mentioned in the false reports. Daisy Luther, author of The Organic Prepper, told us she got the figures for her story’s 57-gallon estimate from Home Water Works, a project from the nonprofit Alliance for Water Efficiency in collaboration with Chicago’s Field Museum. (The Federalist Papers Project did not respond to a request for comment.) The Organic Prepper story reported that an average shower uses 17 gallons of water and an average load of laundry uses 40, and Luther said the 40-gallon figure was listed as the average for older washing machines. But most people now own high-efficiency laundry machines that use between 15 and 30 gallons per wash, according to Home Water Works. And since it is the average water use per capita that matters, one person’s reliance on an older machine would likely be offset by other residents who are not using so much water. A headline stated, ""New law makes it illegal to shower and do laundry on same day."" The new California legislation does not actually make this combination illegal, nor does it create a financial penalty for residents whose water use exceeds a 55-gallon daily limit. Some Californians will need to use less water, but the police will not come knocking or demanding hefty fines should someone shower and do laundry on the same day",False,"June 7, 2018"
"""You’re going to have an increase in the amount of ice in Antarctica because of global warming.""","It’s not every day that a hearing of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee goes viral, but that’s what happened on May 16, 2018, when a Republican lawmaker questioned aspects of climate change. The most frequently shared exchange from the hearing involved Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., and a witness, Phil Duffy, the president and executive director of the Woods Hole Research Center. At one point, Brooks suggested that England’s White Cliffs of Dover and the California coastline are continually eaten away by erosion, perhaps driving a rise in sea levels that scientists ordinarily blame on melting ice. Others have debunked the idea that cliff erosion or sediment release from rivers constitutes a significant factor in sea level rise. (Philip Bump at the Washington Post estimated the current annual sea level increase of 3.3 millimeters would require, every year, ""a volume of earth equivalent to taking the top five inches of every one of the United States’ 9.1 million square miles of land area and using it to coat the bottom of the world’s oceans."") So we won’t go over the same territory. Instead, we decided to look at another comment from Brooks’ exchange with Duffy: Brooks: ""Would it surprise you to know that if global temperatures rise, assuming for the moment that they do, that that actually increases the amount of ice that is collected on Antarctica?"" Duffy: ""That’s not true, sir."" Brooks: ""I made a trip down to Antarctica and met with National Science Foundation scientists, and they all agreed with global warming, and they emphasize that you’re going to have an increase in the amount of ice in Antarctica because of global warming.… ""Do you understand that as temperatures rise, more moisture is contained in the atmosphere and then that moisture in Antarctica collects on land, and it takes hundreds and hundreds of years for that ice that is deposited on Antarctica to actually ever reach the shoreline where it touches the oceans where it can affect in some way sea level increases?"" Is it true, as Brooks said, that ""you’re going to have an increase in the amount of ice in Antarctica because of global warming""? In a statement to PolitiFact, Brooks reiterated what he said he learned from the scientists in Antarctica, including those who believe that global warming is real. The increase in interior ice, he said the scientists told him, should ""offset the loss of Antarctic sea ice, Arctic sea ice, and whatever melting occurs in places like Greenland."" (Read Brooks’ full statement here,) However, more than a dozen scientists told PolitiFact that while Brooks is correctly describing one part of the complicated interplay around Antarctic climate change, whatever ice gains materialize from this process are almost certain to be overwhelmed by melting ice that he’s overlooking. What Brooks said ""is like talking about the money in your bank account by only looking at deposits and ignoring withdrawals,"" said Gary T. Mitchum, a professor and associate dean at the University of South Florida College of Marine Science. ""It’s just flawed. I sure wish I could get away with this at my bank."" How could ice increase due to global warming? It stems from the tendency for a warmer climate to produce more precipitation. In the context of Antarctica, this means increased amounts of frozen precipitation. ""On the whole, the amount of precipitation increases in the coldest climates as they warm,"" said John Nielsen-Gammon, a Texas A&M University atmospheric sciences professor. ""This comes about because the amount of moisture the atmosphere can hold -- and thus deliver as snow -- increases dramatically as the temperature warms."" In fact, there’s already evidence of this occurring in certain parts of Antarctica. One paper documenting this was written by Jay Zwally, a glaciologist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in 2015. He found significant increases in ice in eastern Antarctica. Zwally is considered a credible scientist, but other scientists said his methodology in the study is not foolproof. Critics suggest that much of the increase Zwally measured may be coming from additional snow rather than ice. Because ice contains more water than snow does, an increase in snow rather than ice would mean that Antarctica isn’t taking as much water out of circulation as the paper suggests. Indeed, a study using a different method, headed by Alba Martin-Español of the University of Bristol in England, concluded that the ice gains in eastern Antarctica were only about one-third as large as Zwally had found. An even more important point is that any ice gains need to be measured against losses elsewhere. To look only at the ice gains, as Brooks did, amounts to cherry picking. ""The important thing for science and policy is whether there's a net gain or loss of ice on Antarctica"" from all sources, Nielsen-Gammon said. Scientists we checked with agreed that, while Antarctica’s increased banking of water through precipitation is a real phenomenon, it pales in comparison with the amount of water being lost through melting. Basically, the continent may be adding ice in one place, but it’s losing a larger amount elsewhere due to melting, evaporation, or glaciers falling into the sea. ""Rep. Brooks is correct that one may expect an increase in precipitation in a warmer climate,"" said Justin C. Burton, a physicist at Emory University. ""However, this is a small feedback effect compared to melting from a warmer climate, and especially a warmer ocean."" For the past few decades, most scientific studies have shown that the net change in ice has produced shrinkage overall, not expansion, said Ted Scambos, a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado. In western Antarctica, Scientific American has reported, ""the floating platforms of ice that ring the coast are thinning, glaciers are surging toward the sea, meltwater is flowing across the surface, fast-growing moss is turning the once shimmering landscape green, and a massive iceberg the size of Delaware broke off into the ocean in July of 2017."" ""The near unanimous view is that the net effect, by a pretty big margin, would be melting,"" said John Reilly, co-director of the joint program on the science and policy of global change at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The fear, he said, is that ice ""will break loose and float out, raising sea level and in turn reduce the friction holding back ice on shore, which will then flow faster into the ocean."" Given this degree of melting, Scambos said, the likeliest impact from the increased snowfall that Brooks is pointing to would be to ""slow the pace of ice loss slightly,"" Scambos said. ""Greenland, which is somewhat more impacted by climate change, has not shown enough increase in precipitation to offset the very large peripheral losses in the past few decades."" Even beyond melting, sea level is increasing as the temperature warms because when water gets warmer, it expands. It’s worth noting that the net change in sea level has zig-zagged a bit. In 2011, for instance, it fell, prompting some to suggest an end to the problem. However, sea levels soon started rising again. Such blips are ""common,"" said Gary Griggs, an earth sciences professor at the University of California-Santa Cruz. ""There are year to year variations, but the overall trend is clear."" All told, ""the vast majority of scientists agree that a warming climate will most certainly lead to a net ice loss from Antarctica,"" Burton said. ""The question is really how much and how fast?"" Brooks said, ""You’re going to have an increase in the amount of ice in Antarctica because of global warming."" Scientists agree that parts of Antarctica may already be seeing higher levels of frozen precipitation due to global warming. However, focusing on this increase amounts to cherry-picking, because the same higher temperatures also mean faster melting of existing Antarctic ice. On balance, scientists expect the amount of ice lost from added melting to be much higher than the amount of ice added from greater precipitation",Mostly False,"May 21, 2018"
"Says Dean Heller ""has voted for a GOP bill that funded efforts to revive Yucca Mountain.""","Yucca Mountain is a hot-button issue in Nevada. The idea of storing up to 110,000 metric tons of highly radioactive spent fuel from nuclear power plants has few fans inside the state. President Donald Trump supports the plan and put $110 million into his proposed budget to move it forward. With broad bipartisan support, the House voted overwhelmingly May 10 to have the Energy Department plan and build out the storage site. Democrat Jacky Rosen’s Senate campaign fired off a press release tying incumbent Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., to the House vote. ""Heller couldn’t even stop his close friend of more than a decade, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, from bringing the Yucca Mountain bill to the floor for today’s vote,"" the press release said. ""Heller has voted for a GOP budget that funded efforts to revive Yucca Mountain, and he voted to confirm President Trump’s pro-Yucca budget director last year."" We decided to look at the statement that Heller voted for a Republican budget that advanced the Yucca Mountain waste repository. You may not realize this, but as a nonprofit news organization, we depend on — and answer to — you. Your support directly impacts our abilility to provide objective reporting on issues that matter.

Donate to our Spring Campaign. Go on the record as saying facts matter! The Rosen campaign’s press release linked to an April 12, 2011, article in the Las Vegas Sun. The story said a House budget provision that would have revived the Yucca Mountain proposal had died in the Senate. There’s a lot of history here. With the prospect of waste building up at nuclear power plants across the country, Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. In 1987, it amended the act to make Yucca Mountain the only option for Energy Department planning. Jump forward to 2009. The site had met the safety requirements of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but the Obama administration, citing broad opposition in Nevada, put things on hold. In 2011, House Republicans added a rider to their budget that barred the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from doing anything to close the Yucca Mountain site. The formal text was: ""No funds ... may be used by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to conduct closure of adjudicatory functions, technical review, or support activities associated with the Yucca Mountain geologic repository license application."" So, while the bill didn’t specify any particular sum to open the site, this rider denied money to roll back the planning process. The rider was part of an appropriations package that reached virtually every government agency. The bill funded defense, health and human services, agriculture, and more. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the total price tag was $1.3 trillion. Heller, then a House representative, voted for the bill, which passed pretty much down straight party lines. Every Democrat and only three Republicans voted against it. The Rosen press release singles out the element related to Yucca Mountain, but as is always the case with budget bills, they are about much more than just one issue. It’s also true that Heller tried to remove the Yucca Mountain rider. He offered an amendment that would have prevented any money going toward the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository. That amendment failed on a voice vote. Stewart Boss with the Rosen campaign said they stand by their press release. ""When a partisan budget bill with a controversial Yucca Mountain funding provision came to a vote in 2011, Senator Heller weakly tried and failed to remove the funding,"" Boss said. Heller is on the record as opposing the facility. In 2017, he testified before a House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee, saying ""This ill-conceived project would not only cause significant harm to the well-being of my home state and all Nevadans, but also poses a national security risk that is too great to ignore."" Heller has continued to argue against Yucca Mountain funding in letters to appropriators, including this one in April. The Rosen campaign said that Heller ""has voted for a GOP bill that funded efforts to revive Yucca Mountain."" The GOP bill that got Heller's vote didn’t provide money so much as it barred the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from spending money to roll back the licensing process for the waste repository site. Heller floated an amendment that would have barred spending any money on the site at all. Offering an amendment is not the same as waging a knock-down, drag-out fight, but Heller’s amendment would have stymied the intent of the Republican language. Back then and today, Heller’s official policy is to oppose the Yucca Mountain plan. All of this took place in the context of a massive spending measure. To focus on a single element in a $1.3 trillion bill amounts to legislative cherry-picking",Mostly False,"May 14, 2018"
"""Flint still doesn’t have clean water.""","  The remarks by comedian Michelle Wolf at the White House Correspondents' Dinner were intensely scrutinized by journalists, commentators and users of social media. We don’t fact-check jokes, but we did want to look at one line by Wolf that seemed to be dead serious. At the end of her monologue, Wolf said, ""Flint still doesn’t have clean water."" She’s referring to the woes of Flint, Mich., where a switch in water sources was improperly handled, leading to unsafe levels of lead in the city’s water system. We’ve periodically checked in to see how Flint’s water problems are progressing, but the last time we looked was in late 2016. So, now that Wolf has used Flint’s situation as an exclamation point for her high-profile remarks, we decided to gauge whether she’s right that ""Flint still doesn’t have clean water."" Ultimately, we concluded that the reality is more nuanced than Wolf portrayed it. (We reached out to Wolf’s representatives but did not hear back.) Flint is a low-income and majority African-American city beset by a decline in its manufacturing industry. The city’s lead poisoning was precipitated by Gov. Rick Snyder. Snyder, a Republican, had campaigned on his managerial experience and promised to bring outside experts to transform financially languishing municipalities. Under an emergency manager appointed by the state, the city ended its agreement to obtain water from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department and instead joined a new pipeline project, the Karegnondi Water Authority, that would draw water from Lake Huron. The move, made officially in April 2013, was done in large part to save the city millions of dollars. The day after the switch was announced, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department said it would cut off service in April 2014. Since the pipeline wouldn’t be ready by then, the city prepared to switch its water supply to the Flint River. However, the river water contained salts that would corrode pipes, and the right mix of corrosion inhibitors was never used. Not only did residents complain that their new water was foul, but it eventually became clear that lead was leaching into the water supply from the city’s old pipes. Lead is a highly toxic metal, especially for children whose bodies are still developing. After a litany of missed opportunities, the situation became a focus of the national media in the second half of 2015, prompting both emergency water distribution and a search for a longer-term solution. Flint faces two issues around its water supply: the quality of the water itself, and the effort to remove pipes that contain lead. First, let’s take a look at water quality. By July 2016, the federal Environmental Protection Agency had found significant reductions in lead levels, as long as residents used filters that were provided free of charge. Since then, there have been further improvements. A regulation known as the Federal Lead and Copper Rule set the safe limit for lead in water at 15 parts per billion in 90 percent of samples, using specific testing procedures. Most tests with these procedures in Flint have found that ""lead levels have fallen to legally safe levels,"" said Peggy Kahn, a University of Michigan-Flint political scientist who has closely tracked the issue. Tests conducted in 2017 over a seven-month period by Susan J. Mastern of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Michigan State found lead levels that met the federal standard. Marc Edwards is a Virginia Tech environmental and water resources engineer who leads the Flint Water Study team, which helped identify the problem in the first place. His team also conducted tests in late 2017 and found lead levels below the legal threshold. So there’s solid evidence that Flint’s water is in compliance with federal regulations. That said, no level of lead is truly safe. Even the legal lead level for water does not fully protect children’s health, Kahn said, especially when there are other environmental sources of lead. ""There is no such thing as perfectly safe water anywhere in the U.S.,"" Edwards said. ""Even bottled water sometimes has health risks."" Progress on replacing old, unsafe pipes has been slower. In March 2016, Flint began to rip out and replace some of the hazardous pipes under a ""FAST Start program."" That program continues. Kristin Moore, a Flint city government spokeswoman, said that 6,264 pipes have been replaced as of April 18, 2018. However, an estimated 12,000 Flint residences still have lead and galvanized service lines that need to be replaced, she said. ""The pipe replacement work is expected to be completed by 2020,"" Moore said. ""However, the mayor is hopeful that the project can be completed even sooner."" One factor slowing the work is that ""individual home tests may vary even within the same neighborhood,"" due to differences in how the original pipes were laid, said Kimberly Saks McManaway, director of the master’s of public administration program at the University of Michigan-Flint. The consensus we found is that the water quality in Flint is greatly improved, but the city is not out of the woods yet. ""While progress indeed continues to be made in Flint, Mayor Karen Weaver has said that there are still issues that must be addressed,"" said Moore, the city spokeswoman. She said residents are urged to drink water that is filtered and to keep their filters properly maintained, adding ""some with health issues or compromised immune systems may be advised by medical professionals to drink bottled water."" That said, Flint’s water quality now exceeds that of other cities with old water pipes, Edwards said. Kahn agreed that there has been ""great improvement"" compared to the worst of the crisis. However, she added that ""there are still significant safety concerns, and there is a deep level of mistrust in view of some of the recent testing results and warnings, terrible past damage, unresponsiveness, and cover-ups."" Wolf said, ""Flint still doesn’t have clean water."" In reality, testing in recent months has repeatedly shown that Flint’s water meets federal standards. At the same time, the city won’t be fully safe until its old pipes are all replaced, which is currently estimated to happen in 2020. Considerable hurdles remain for Flint, but Wolf’s statement glossed over the significant progress made in water quality since the worst of the crisis",Half True,"May 1, 2018"
"Says Florida Gov. Rick Scott ""just signed a bill that could make most of Florida’s beaches private.""","Confusion about what a new law means for Florida beaches is prompting fears and political attacks. Advocacy group For Our Future Florida used HB 631 as a wedge in the U.S. Senate race, where Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson is facing a challenge from Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who signed the bill into law in March. ""On #EarthDay, we want to thank @SenBillNelson who has always fought for and defended the health of Florida’s coastlines and environment, while @FLGovScott just signed a bill that could make most of Florida’s beaches private,"" For Our Future Florida tweeted April 22. On #EarthDay, we want to thank @SenBillNelson who has always fought for and defended the health of Florida’s coastlines and environment, while @FLGovScott just signed a bill that could make most of Florida’s beaches private. pic.twitter.com/73MsfRdg49 Please pause before cancelling your summer vacation. This claim needs a fact-check. In reality, more than half of Florida beaches are already privately owned. The new law, opposed by many environmental groups, affects the procedure for local governments that want to make private beaches public. Starting July 1, any city or county that wants to enact an ordinance to make private beaches public will have to go through the courts. The sound bite from For Our Future Florida rests on the notion that private beach owners will use the law to limit public access. But we don’t know how those owners will react. The law Scott signed isn’t going to turn beaches that are public now over to private ownership. What it will do is make it harder to guarantee public access on beaches that were already privately owned. Before the new law, local governments could adopt ordinances guaranteeing the public’s access to privately owned beach property. Those ordinances stemmed from a legal principle known as ""customary use."" ""Customary use"" refers to the public’s historic access to the dry sand portion of the beach that may belong to a private property owner. ""The idea and custom goes all the way back to ancient Rome and falls under the same set of ideas as the sea belongs to everyone and all have an equal right to use it,"" said David Cullen, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, which opposed the bill. For example, the owners of an oceanfront estate in South Beach may decide they do not like that beachgoers are setting up camp on the shoreside portion of their property. They install a fence and ""no trespassing"" signs to tell the public to stay away. The Florida Supreme Court ruled that if a private property owner tries to do this, then the local government could enact an ordinance guaranteeing the public’s use of that land under ""customary use,"" following their usual notice and hearing process. If landowners wanted to challenge the ordinance, they would have to sue the local government. Lawmakers drafted HB 631 to put more of the onus on the government and to establish a uniform process that includes all the stakeholders. A situation in the Panhandle’s Walton County, which passed ordinances based on this ""customary use"" doctrine in 2016, illustrates why some lawmakers supported the bill. After the ordinance was passed in Walton County, some beach property owners filed lawsuits to overturn it. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida upheld the county’s ordinance, but landowners appealed that decision.   ""Without the courts involved on the front end, individual property owners could and did sue to challenge county ordinances around the state,"" said Rep. Paul Renner, R-Palm Coast, in a letter to the editor for the Palm Coast Observer website. ""The taxpayers were on the hook for legal fees to defend every individual case against the county and pay any damages awarded if the county got it wrong."" Starting July 1, local governments that seek to adopt an ordinance that is premised on customary use rights must first notify all the owners of land that might be implicated, and then file a proceeding in court. The court will decide the question of whether the public has customary use rights in that specific area. The Sierra Club’s Cullen predicts the law will embolden people to stick fences and ""no trespassing"" signs on their properties. If that happens, local governments will have a bigger legal hurdle to clear before guaranteeing the public’s access to that area. That said, the new law does not affect any property or beach use rights. It doesn’t affect the rights the public had to use the dry sand beach before it was enacted, nor does it affect landowners’ rights. Law experts and leaders in the beach communities emphasized that the public should not feel compelled to change patterns of historic beach usage as a result of the law’s passage. ""If the public has customary use rights in a given area, the statute doesn’t change that in any way,"" said Alyson Flournoy, a University of Florida Levin College of Law professor. ""Those common law rights exist, whether or not there is an ordinance and whether or not there has been a judicial decision. The rights may be contested, but that doesn’t mean they are any more or less valid after July 1, 2018."" For Our Future Florida said that Scott ""just signed a bill that could make most of Florida’s beaches private."" The law does benefit private beach owners in a way. But this is a poor explanation that obscures critical facts. The law Scott signed would not result in turning more public beaches into private ones. In reality, when the law takes effect, it will make it harder for local governments to guarantee public access to beaches that are already private by throwing in a new judicial obstacle. It’s unclear at this point how the law will change private beach access, because that depends on the actions of local governments and private beach owners",Mostly False,"April 26, 2018"

Evan Jenkins, boasted about his efforts to rein in the agency. ""I’ve cut a half a billion (dollars) out of the EPA just in the last two years. We’ve cut 3,000 jobs out of the EPA,"" he said. (It’s around 29:30 in the video.) We’ll look at the two parts of this statement separately -- first, the agency’s budget, and second, its employment level. Jenkins would have been more accurate if he’d said ""we’ve"" cut half a billion dollars, as he did in the second part of his statement. Obviously, in our constitutional system of checks and balances, individual U.S. House members cannot cut an agency’s budget on their own. On the more substantive question, however, Jenkins was on target. In fact, he lowballed it a little. Historical data from the Office of Management and Budget, shows spending by the EPA at $8.725 billion in 2016; $8.165 billion in 2017; and an estimated $7.916 billion in 2018. The two-year difference between 2016 and 2018 is $809 million, which is more than half a billion dollars, or a 9.2 percent reduction over that two-year span. The actual amount allowed by the omnibus spending bill passed after OMB made its estimate is slightly higher for 2018 -- $8.058 billion. But even at that higher level, the two-year decrease exceeds the half-billion-dollar figure Jenkins cited. Here’s a chart showing EPA’s budget going back to 2009: So Jenkins’ budget number appears solid. For employment, we used a data tool created by the federal Office of Management and Budget called FedScope, which federal employment gurus consider the most accurate information available. FedScope provides detailed employment data on a quarterly basis; the most recent quarter available at the time of Jenkins’ comment was September 2017. For simplicity, we took note of EPA employment in September of every year. In September 2015, EPA employed 15,445 people; in September 2016, it employed 15,634; and in September 2017, it employed 15,058. Over this two-year period, EPA employment fell by 387 people -- well short of the 3,000 Jenkins cited. The only way you can achieve a decrease of 3,000 EPA employees is by comparing the September 2017 level to the September 2012 level -- a five-year period that started before Jenkins was even in Congress. Moreover, EPA employment in 2012 was boosted by spending through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act -- more commonly known as the stimulus bill signed by President Barack Obama. So a chunk of the jobs lost since then were always intended to be temporary. This chart shows EPA employment every September going back to 2009, according to FedScope: When we asked the Partnership for Public Service, a group that studies federal employment, to look at our math, they agreed that it was accurate. Jenkins’ campaign said the candidate was referring to a news release from the House Appropriations Committee that mentioned a decline of 3,106 jobs at the EPA since 2010 -- a longer period than a listener would have assumed hearing Jenkins’ comments at the debate. When more recent data is released, it may show additional decreases in employment at EPA. An EPA plan for a government shutdown in December 2017 said the agency had a staff of 14,449, which was down from the prior shutdown plan in April, which cited a staff size of 15,219, according to the liberal website ThinkProgress. That’s a decline of 770, but it’s still not as high as the 3,000 Jenkins noted. Jenkins said, ""I’ve cut a half a billion (dollars) out of the EPA just in the last two years. We’ve cut 3,000 jobs out of the EPA."" Setting aside his choice of ""I"" rather than ""we,"" Jenkins has a point about the decrease in the EPA’s budget; in anything, his estimate is actually low. On employment, though, 3,000 jobs shed is an overzealous estimate. To get a number that large, you have to go back at least to 2012, before Jenkins was in Congress",Mostly True,"April 26, 2018"
"Says Scott Pruitt’s security spending was ""somewhat more"" than his predecessor.","President Donald Trump came out in defense of Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator under fire for multiple ethics violations, in a tweet April 7. ""While Security spending was somewhat more than his predecessor, Scott Pruitt has received death threats because of his bold actions at EPA. Record clean Air & Water while saving USA Billions of Dollars. Rent was about market rate, travel expenses OK. Scott is doing a great job!"" While Security spending was somewhat more than his predecessor, Scott Pruitt has received death threats because of his bold actions at EPA. Record clean Air & Water while saving USA Billions of Dollars. Rent was about market rate, travel expenses OK. Scott is doing a great job! In this fact-check, we zeroed in on Trump’s claim that Pruitt’s spending was ""somewhat more"" than his predecessor. No public records tally up Pruitt’s or his predecessors’ individual security costs. But there are many reports and Freedom of Information Act responses comparing Pruitt’s practices with his predecessors’ — and they suggest that ""somewhat more"" is not suitable to describe the grandeur of Pruitt’s expenditures. Spending on Pruitt’s security detail tallied up to $832,735.40 during his first three months in office, and a soundproof security booth in his personal office cost $24,570, U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., detailed in an Oct. 7, 2017, letter to EPA Inspector General Arthur Elkins. That’s ""nearly double what the two previous administrators spent on security over that same timeframe,"" wrote DeFazio, in his capacity as the ranking member on the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. While we don’t have access to the budget breakdown, we unearthed a few details that make Pruitt’s security spending stand out. First off, Pruitt is the first EPA administrator with 24/7 security detail. Pruitt has at least double the number of security guards as Gina McCarthy, the previous EPA administrator under President Barack Obama. An Associated Press investigation found Pruitt has 20 full-time security agents. The office of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., found through an Inspector General information request that nearly three dozen EPA security and law enforcement officers were assigned to Pruitt over a six-week period from mid 2017 to the beginning of 2018. The schedules obtained by Whitehouse show multiple EPA security agents accompanied Pruitt and his family on vacations, football games and baseball games, during which no EPA business was conducted. McCarthy, on the other hand, had six or seven full-time guards, according to Liz Purchia, who was McCarthy’s spokeswoman at the EPA. Those staffers accompanied her door-to-door during her workday, but did not work around-the-clock or accompany her on personal travel. EPA chiefs’ protection is normally limited to door-to-door security, explained Elgie Holstein, a current director at the Environmental Defense Fund and former Energy Department chief of staff under the Clinton administration. ""The administrator of the EPA is not a high-profile position, and especially not internationally. (During travel) there’s typically only a couple of security people, three at most,"" Holstein said. ""Not a phalanx of protection as though he were to be assaulted any moment."" But the reason for Pruitt’s security is what special agent in charge Nino Perrotta calls a ""high level of unusual interest in the administrator."" Patrick Sullivan, EPA's assistant inspector general for investigations, said Pruitt received more death threats than any of his predecessors. In the interest of Pruitt’s safety, the number of death threats is not made publicly available. The rough estimate of over 70 threats has not been updated since September, Inspector General spokeswoman Kentia Elbaum said. ""We have at least four to five times the number of threats against Mr. Pruitt than we had against Ms. McCarthy,"" Sullivan said. But in its investigation, the Associated Press found no federal or state court records of arrests or charges for death threats to Pruitt. EPA FOIA analyst Candace White told Buzzfeed senior investigation reporter Jason Leopold in response to a FOIA request that neither the EPA nor the OIG held any records relating to death threats. ""If there is a credible threat, the administrator’s protection would be leveraged by D.C. police in town, embassy guards overseas, or uniformed protection in the building,"" Holstein said. ""These existing resources are not the same thing as pulling people off superfund investigations and bringing them to Washington. This is a head scratcher."" It is tricky to compare travel expenses across various EPA administrations. In total, the EPA spent about $731,000 on McCarthy's trips and $464,000 on previous EPA administrator Lisa Jackson's trips, according to a document the EPA press office sent reporters in March. The figures lump together both travel and security costs combined for all travelers, not just the administrator. Those totals encompass the two ex-administrators’ entire tenures heading the EPA. McCarthy was in office three and a half years, and Jackson served four years. Pruitt, on the other hand, had a significantly higher price tag despite entering office in February 2017. An EPA official told the Associated Press ""total security costs approached $3 million when pay is added to travel expenses."" McCarthy’s trips cost on average less than $120,000 — the price tag a Washington Post report put on Pruitt’s June 2017 trip to Italy, where he visited the U.S. Embassy in Rome and took a private tour of the Vatican before attending a meeting of G-7 environment ministers in Bologna. Trump said Pruitt’s ""security spending was somewhat more than his predecessor."" ""Somewhat more"" is a significant understatement of the situation. By almost every measurement available, Pruitt more than doubles his immediate predecessor’s spending on security. The White House attributed the additional spending to unprecedented death threats. We were unable to obtain any details on the gravity of those threats",Mostly False,"April 10, 2018"
"NC Republicans ""raided $58 million that was supposed to help create jobs for North Carolinians.""","Approval of a key permit for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline through Eastern North Carolina has been among the most hotly debated political moves this year. The state Department of Environmental Quality in January signed off on the permit for the 600-mile pipeline, which is expected to deliver natural gas to the eastern part of the state from fracking operations in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Shortly after Gov. Roy Cooper’s administration approved the permit, Cooper announced that pipeline builders Dominion Power and Duke Energy planned to put $57.8 million in a fund to be used for environmental and economic-development initiatives. Some advocacy groups worry the pipeline will hurt the environment. Meanwhile, many Republicans in the GOP-controlled N.C. General Assembly questioned the legality of the mitigation fund and accused Cooper’s administration of conducting pay-to-play politics. They suggested Cooper required pipeline builders to fund mitigation efforts in order to acquire the permit, which Cooper has denied. In February, the legislature voted to redirect the $57.8 million to schools in districts that the pipeline would run through. In response, the North Carolina Democratic Party recently launched an ad campaign that targets Republicans in Eastern North Carolina districts. The online ads and mailers say state Reps. John Bell and Brenden Jones, as well as state Sen. Danny Britt ""raided $58 million that was supposed to help create jobs for North Carolinians."" Every seat in the N.C. General Assembly is up for election this year and Democrats hope to gain influence in Raleigh. Republicans hold a supermajority in both the state House and state Senate. But, aiming to capitalize on President Donald Trump’s unpopularity, Democrats expect to break the supermajority and hope to take control of at least one of the chambers in midterm elections this fall. The N.C. Democratic Party told reporters in a press briefing on March 22 that their messaging on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline in Eastern North Carolina has been effective. In an email to PolitiFact, party spokesman Robert Howard defended the mailers as both ""factually accurate and intellectually honest."" The party ""launched digital ads and mailers to hold Republican politicians accountable for raiding a fund meant to help eastern North Carolina access the Atlantic Coast Pipeline,"" Howard said in an email. ""The funds would have gone towards economic development in Eastern North Carolina by covering costs of fuel distribution lines as well as renewable energy projects. Republicans diverted funds through HB90 as part of a 'poison pill' provision in an omnibus bill that included a Democratic priority – funding for the class size mandate."" Mitigation money Cooper’s office said half of the $57.8 million is supposed to go toward mitigating the environmental damage the pipeline may cause to wetlands, streams and wildlife habitats. The rest is designated for economic development and renewable energy projects. However, the deal didn't specify the projects or the number of jobs that would be created. The state would receive half of the $57.8 million once the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has approved the pipeline; the rest would be paid upon its completion. Sadie Weiner, Cooper's communications director, said the Rural Infrastructure Authority and the Clean Water Management Trust Fund are two agencies that could distribute the funds. On the economic side, WRAL reported the Cooper administration hoped the money would help farmers in Eastern North Carolina hook into distribution lines tied back to the pipeline. They hoped the new gas connections would not only prevent economic damages, but also create jobs. Durwood Stephenson, director of the U.S. 70 Corridor Commission, and Norris Tolsen, president of the Carolinas Gateway Partnership, told WRAL that they’d heard from companies unwilling to consider Eastern North Carolina manufacturing sites without easy access to natural gas, and the Atlantic Coast Pipeline planned just three taps along the project's 200-mile route through the state. Prior to DEQ’s approval of the pipeline permit, utility companies ran commercials claiming the project would bring jobs to NC. Where the money went Democrats and many school advocates across the state had been lobbying the legislature to avoid what they called ""class size chaos,"" which they said would happen if state laws went into effect this summer requiring schools to lower average K-3 class sizes from 20 students per room this school year to roughly 17 students in July. School leaders had said they didn't have the thousands of extra classrooms needed and might have to fire art, music and physical education teachers to help come up with the money to hire additional K-3 teachers. House Bill 90 pushed back the class size deadline for schools and redirected the mitigation funds to go to school districts in the eight counties the pipeline would run through. The ads provided to PolitiFact don't say what Republicans did with the mitigation money. They also omit details about the vote, giving the impression that the vote was overwhelmingly partisan. But a majority of Democrats voted for it too – including many from Eastern North Carolina. The vote In the state House, the bill passed 104-12. In the state Senate, it passed 37-5. In fact, none of the House Democrats from areas east of Raleigh opposed the bill. And in the Senate, Angela Bryant was the only Democrat from Eastern North Carolina to oppose the bill. So, on paper, it appears as if many Democrats wanted to redirect money from the pipeline mitigation fund. However, some Democrats said they only voted for the bill because it funneled money to needy schools. Republicans hold majorities in the House and Senate and could’ve redirected the mitigation money without support from Democrats. So Democrats had two realistic options. They could oppose the bill, supporting Cooper but risking the chance that Republicans accuse them of not prioritizing education. Or they could support the bill, breaking with Cooper on the pipeline fund but going on record as supporting education. Most chose the latter. Cooper, for his part, said he supported the class size changes and didn’t veto the bill. ""Democratic lawmakers strongly objected to Republicans’ decision to address changes to the state elections board, the Atlantic Coast Pipeline mitigation fund, and a class size fix in a single piece of legislation,"" said Howard of NCDP. ""Many Democratic politicians stated publicly that they are voting in favor of bill solely because of the class size funding measure."" What Democrats said State Reps. Garland Pierce and Bobbie Richardson, Democrats from Eastern North Carolina, voted for the bill. But they stood next to House Minority Leader Darren Jackson of Wake County during a press conference as he denounced Republicans for tying education funding to the pipeline. Jackson said it put Democrats in a political predicament in an election year. ""There will be a lot of support obviously for the class size and pre-K fix."" The rest of the bill, Jackson said, ""is an attempt to get the governor to veto it or us to vote against it so they can run political ads."" State Sen. Erica Smith, a Democrat from Eastern North Carolina, supported the bill but noted the situation in her statement to Policy Watch, a news arm of a liberal-leaning think tank. ""When you put these provisions in this bill in this manner in which it is, you make it unfair. You make it political,"" Smith is quoted saying. State Sen. Paul Lowe, a Forsyth County Democrat, said some only voted for the bill while holding their noses. ""But it’s bad, really bad. You didn’t have to do it this way."" State Rep. Gale Adcock, a Cary Democrat who voted for the bill, noted that Republicans could have addressed the education and pipeline issues separately – but chose not to. She described the bill as ""a bitter pill."" Our ruling An NC Democratic Party ad campaign claims Republicans in the legislature ""raided $58 million that was supposed to help create jobs for North Carolinians."" It's unclear how many jobs the mitigation fund would create. The party also withheld the fact that Democrats voted for the bill too, and that the mitigation fund was diverted to schools. But the party’s broader point is accurate. Republicans led the push to empty the mitigation fund and Democrats reluctantly went along with the effort because it was tied to education changes they supported",Half True,"March 27, 2018"
"A Trump administration proposal for the Interior Department ""is the largest investment in our public lands infrastructure in our nation's history.""","  Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said President Donald Trump’s administration has record-setting plans to invest in federal government landholdings. ""The president is a builder and the son of a plumber, as I am,"" Zinke told the Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee. ""I look forward to working with the president on restoring America's greatness through a historic investment of our public lands infrastructure. This is the largest investment in our public lands infrastructure in our nation's history. Let me repeat that, this is the largest investment in our public lands infrastructure in the history of this country."" Zinke specified that he was referring to the president's budget proposal, which would create a fund to provide ""up to $18 billion over 10 years for maintenance and improvements in our national parks, our national wildlife refuges, and Bureau of Indian Education funds."" When we took a closer look, we found Zinke’s assertion to be dubious. There is little chance that the Civilian Conservation Corps, President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal-era program, will lose its place atop the list of federal programs that have supported public-lands infrastructure. The president’s budget for fiscal year 2019 proposes ""a new Public Lands Infrastructure Fund"" for repairs and improvements at places such as national parks and wildlife refuges. The administration estimates that increased energy development on federal lands and in federal waters ""has the potential to generate up to $18 billion over 10 years for parks and other public lands infrastructure."" However, there is no certainty that the idea will win the necessary congressional approval. It’s common for presidential budget proposals to wither on the vine, even when the president has a Congress controlled by his own party. Also, Zinke said ""up to $18 billion,"" meaning that the final amount could be well below that. Generating any money at all to fill the fund’s coffers would require additional energy development from federal lands and waters. New development seems possible in the Trump era. But the number of new projects will depend heavily on international market conditions for oil and gas, which are currently modest by historical standards. Finally, this doesn’t take into account any cuts to public lands infrastructure that emerge from elsewhere in the administration’s budget. Overall, the proposal would cut the Interior Department by 15 percent. For the sake of this fact-check, let’s assume that the federal government is able to come up with enough new drilling projects to spend the full $18 billion on public lands infrastructure and that it avoids any offsetting maintenance cuts from other parts of the budget. Even in that scenario, Zinke’s proposal pales compared to the investments made under the Civilian Conservation Corps. Members of the Civilian Conservation Corps circa 1933. (National Archives) Roosevelt established the Civilian Conservation Corps in the midst of the Great Depression and just over a month after he was inaugurated in 1933. The program paid unmarried men (and only men) between 18 and 25 years of age to do unskilled labor to conserve and develop natural resources on public lands. Workers received room, board and $30 a month, most of which had to be sent back home to the worker’s family. Some received educational services in the camps, with tens of thousands learning to read for the first time. Among the corps’ achievements were the planting of more than 2 billion trees, the construction of more than 125,000 miles of roads and trails, the creation of more than 6 million erosion control structures, the stringing of 89,000 miles of telephone lines, and 6 million work days fighting forest fires. All told, 3.5 million men took part during the program’s nine years of existence, spread over more than 1,000 constantly shifting camps at any given time. ""There is no doubt in my mind that the CCC was the most groundbreaking program to ever influence our park system at the local, state, and national levels,"" said Neil M. Maher, author of the book Nature’s New Deal: The Civilian Conservation Corps and the Roots of the American Environmental Movement. The corps ""basically built the infrastructure of our National Park system."" The most frequent estimate of the program’s cost is a cumulative $3 billion in outlays during its nine-year life. From our research, this figure appears to be credible. The CCC’s director wrote in 1939 that it had cost $2 billion; that was two-thirds of the way through the program’s life. And according to a Park Service study, the annual annual cost per CCC enrollee was $1,004 per year. If you assume that the average tenure of the CCC’s 3.5 million workers was about a year, that would produce a cumulative cost around $3 billion. Such calculations ""sound right — millions of young men, camps to house them, food and uniforms, and they were paid,"" said Steven Stoll, an environmental historian at Fordham University. Once you factor in inflation, $3 billion spent in the 1930s would be the equivalent of about $53 billion today — about three times bigger than even the fully funded Trump proposal. The CCC’s investment appears even more massive when viewed as a percentage of federal spending. During the 1930s, when federal outlays were more modest, the CCC’s $3 billion investment accounted for just over 4 percent of all federal outlays that were made over the program’s nine-year period. By contrast, the fully funded Trump proposal would account for somewhere around four ten-thousandths of 1 percent of federal outlays during its 10-year life. Interior Department spokeswoman Heather Swift pointed out that the CCC ""also incorporated state and local land."" It’s true that the CCC created more than 700 state parks and upgraded many others, in addition to its efforts on federally owned land. Ultimately, though, the point is moot: Zinke didn’t say the proposal is the largest investment in federal lands infrastructure. He said ""public lands infrastructure,"" and state and local parks count as ""public lands."" Zinke said that a Trump administration proposal for the Interior Department ""is the largest investment in our public lands infrastructure in our nation's history."" It’s far from assured that the maximum figure of $18 billion in the proposal will ever be reached if enacted. Beyond that, though, Roosevelt’s $3 billion investment in the Civilian Conservation Corps would amount to $53 billion today, and it accounted for vastly more than the Trump proposal as a percentage of federal spending at the time",False,"March 19, 2018"
"""The Legionella bacteria is in most water systems in Illinois.""","In 2015, during Bruce Rauner’s first year as governor, a virulent outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease at the state-run Illinois Veterans’ Home in downstate Quincy killed 12 residents and sickened dozens of others. Since then, according to recent news reports, the facility has been plagued by more illness and deaths from Legionnaires’, which experts say is usually linked to the inhaling of a bacteria that thrives in poorly maintained water systems. It was also reported by WBEZ that Rauner administration officials delayed public disclosure of the 2015 outbreak for nearly a week after discovering it. Critics claim the governor’s failure to act quickly to safeguard the water at Quincy after the initial incident displayed an indifference to the fate of the elderly military veterans who live there. Family members of victims have filed suit against the state over their deaths. Meanwhile, one potential Democratic challenger to Rauner’s re-election, J.B. Pritzker, began running TV spots attacking the Republican incumbent’s handling of the Quincy situation. Rauner insists his administration did not drop the ball, and recently spent seven days living at the home to make a public show that it was safe. He also took aim at the media for casting blame his way without telling the whole story. In an interview with the editorial board of the Joliet Herald-News, Rauner said news reports failed to explain that the source of the disease is basically everywhere. ""The reality is, and this is what’s not getting into the reports, the Legionella bacteria is in most water systems in Illinois,"" Rauner told the paper. ""There were just two infections of Legionnaires at Northwestern Hospital, which is not even an old facility and I think is regarded as a really well-run facility. These things happen."" We wondered if the governor is right. Are bacteria that can cause Legionnaires’ disease lurking in most building water systems? And, if so, what public health danger does that pose? Legionnaires’ disease is a severe and sometimes deadly form of pneumonia that derives its name from its first recognized outbreak in 1976 at an American Legion convention in Philadelphia. Most at risk are the elderly and those with compromised immune systems, cited by state officials as one reason why the outbreaks at the Quincy facility proved so serious. Legionnaires is spread through aerosolized water drops inhaled into the lungs, with showers, faucets, hot tubs and mist from large building air-conditioning units serving as common sources for spreading the infection. The disease is unlikely to be spread from drinking contaminated water. Rachel Bold, a spokeswoman for Rauner, cited explanations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the World Health Organization and the scientific journal PLOS One to reinforce his claim that bacteria that can cause the disease are widespread. However, none of those sources contained information confirming that a majority of Illinois building water systems contained the bacteria, known as Legionella. Erik Olson, health program director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said Legionella likely can be found in many water systems. Even so, Olson said it was ""misleading"" for Rauner to attempt to frame the danger so broadly. Trace amounts of the bacteria don’t pose a threat unless allowed to grow due to poor building maintenance, Olson explained. He likened the phenomenon to that of coliform bacteria, which are also widespread in the environment. Many forms of coliform bacteria are harmless, he said, while some can lead to potentially deadly E. coli in food if proper sanitation procedures are not followed. The CDC also stresses that poor building maintenance — rather than the widespread presence of low-level bacteria — is the main culprit in Legionnaires’ outbreaks. Legionella is naturally occurring and is present at low levels in water sources such as lakes and rivers. Therefore, it’s assumed by government officials that the bacteria makes its way into building systems. However, there’s no quantifiable data. ""We don’t actually have an exact number or even proportion,"" CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund said in an interview. State health departments report annual incidents of Legionnaires’ cases to the CDC. There were 6,000 cases reported nationwide in 2015. An estimated 9 to 10 percent of all cases result in death, Nordlund said, though the agency doesn’t ask states to report numbers of deaths from the disease. In 2015, the city of Chicago advised building owners to check and clean water supply systems to guard against the spread of Legionnaires. ""Legionella bacteria are present at low levels in many water systems,"" the city letter stated. ""Background levels of Legionella are not known to be a significant risk when associated with proper water quality management of water systems."" Northwestern Memorial Hospital spokesman Christopher King confirmed Rauner’s claim that two patients treated at the hospital within the past six months tested positive for Legionella. The hospital is working with state health officials and conducting its own review ""to determine if these two cases are related,"" he said, declining to comment further. Rauner says news reports about his administration’s response to recurring incidents of Legionnaires’ disease at the Illinois Veterans’ Home in Quincy leave out a key part of the story: ""The Legionella bacteria is in most water systems in Illinois."" The governor’s statement glosses over the reality that any such contamination is likely present at low and non-threatening levels. The use of the word ""most"" is also questionable since there’s no real quantifiable evidence. The CDC avoids quantifying the presence of the bacteria, which thrives on slime in poorly maintained internal water systems. The governor has a point that the bacteria lurks in a number of water systems. But his statement makes an unprovable claim about the extent of the contamination. The governor’s claim is overbroad and lacking in context",Half True,"January 16, 2018"
"""In Congress, @RonDeSantisFL was the DECIDING vote AGAINST our state's right to protect Florida waters from drilling.""","Democratic gubernatorial candidate Gwen Graham called out her newest Republican opponent Ron DeSantis for going to bat for oil drilling off Florida’s coast. Her Jan. 4 tweet came as the White House prepared to announce a new offshore drilling plan that originally included Florida among states that would see expanded drilling. (The White House later walked it back to exempt Florida at the urging of Gov. Rick Scott.) When DeSantis had the opportunity to keep drilling out of Florida, Graham said, he went against it. ""In Congress, @RonDeSantisFL was the DECIDING vote AGAINST our state's right to protect Florida waters from drilling,"" Graham tweeted. ""Will Congressman DeSantis stand up for Florida or is he too scared of losing @realDoanldTramp's endorsement?"" In Congress, @RonDeSantisFL was the DECIDING vote AGAINST our state's right to protect Florida waters from drilling. Will Congressman DeSantis stand up for Florida or is he too scared of losing @realDoanldTramp's endorsement? https://t.co/6pgiXY1gFp The tweet included a link to a close vote on a 2013 amendment to the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act (HR 2231), which never became law. Was DeSantis, whose district includes several east coast beaches, really ""the deciding vote"" on an effort to keep drilling out of the state? The short answer: It’s hard to say there is ever such a thing as ""the deciding vote"" with close calls in Congress.  DeSantis’ specific position on drilling is squishy. Most recently, DeSantis embraced Scott's opposition to Trump's plan. ""In Florida our coastline is so important to our economy, it’s important to property values, it’s important to tourism,"" DeSantis said on Fox & Friends. ""And we need to protect our coastline."" Other actions speak to support for the coast, including a December 2015 letter to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management against seismic airgun exploration and a letter in opposition to the 2017 Interior Department executive order that advanced offshore oil and gas exploration in the Atlantic Ocean.   There’s also his vote in favor of a failed amendment that would have banned seismic testing in areas bordering Florida. He was one of 24 Republicans to vote for the testing ban. He also voted for a Graham amendement that would have restricted funds being used for the research, investigation, or study of offshore drilling.  But that's not to say that DeSantis has always voted against drilling.  The 210-209 vote in Graham's tweet happened years earlier. In the summer of 2013, then-U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Orlando, proposed an amendment to the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act pushed by House Republicans. The larger bill aimed to expand U.S. offshore energy production by directing the U.S. Interior Department secretary to implement a five-year oil and gas leasing program off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Grayson’s amendment would have ensured the ability of Florida or any state to prohibit the use of drilling within its boundaries. At the time, Grayson said the amendment would have avoided the possibility of the federal government overriding states' rights to decide. When it came to a vote, Grayson’s amendment failed by one vote, and DeSantis voted against the amendment. The larger bill passed the House but did move past the Democratic-controlled Senate. Does that mean he was the ""deciding vote?"" There’s no doubt that DeSantis’ vote was crucial. But as we have concluded in fact-checks of similar attacks, the ""deciding vote"" label could just as easily be applied to any other lawmaker who voted on his side — making the term a bit meaningless. (Many Democrats were attacked as being the deciding vote on the narrowly passed Affordable Care Act, for example.) That’s the general rule. We wondered if DeSantis did anything to justify being singled out, such as holding his support until the last moment. We couldn’t spot from C-SPAN footage whether DeSantis was one of the members who changed his mind at the literal last minute. Even if he were, however, he would not have been the only lawmaker to do so. Graham spokesman Matt Harringer argued it is noteworthy that DeSantis was in the minority of Florida Republicans who voted against this amendment. Seven Florida Republicans, including DeSantis, voted against the amendment, while nine Republicans voted for the amendment. DeSantis’ team didn’t argue his vote, but they did take issue with Graham’s framing of the measure as a vote ""against our state’s right to protect Florida waters from drilling."" Many Republicans didn’t see it that way, arguing Grayson’s measure would not have actually changed Florida’s control of its coast. ""Since the underlying bill did nothing to alter the existing relationship between the federal and state governments, the amendment itself contained no substantive policy that would have changed the ability of Florida to prevent development of waters within its jurisdiction,"" said DeSantis spokeswoman Elizabeth Fusick. Fusick said the balance of power between the federal and state government was already determined by the Submerged Lands Act (which sets federal government ownership of submerged lands after the first three miles from the state’s coast) and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (which also applies to land beyond three miles offshore), which were both enacted in 1953. Holly Parker, the Florida regional manager for the Surfrider Foundation, said that if Grayson’s amendment only applied to state waters, then it would seem to be a duplication of an existing right. However, she said it’s possible that the broader failed legislation would have changed that.   ""Now, if the underlying legislation somehow impeded those state rights and this amendment was an attempt to clarify or delineate the rights of a state to regulate those submerged (lands), that would be different,"" Parker said. Athan Manuel, the director of the Sierra Club’s Land’s Protection Program, said he thinks it's possible that the bill could have changed the separation of powers. Regardless, he said, the point of Grayson’s amendment was to be ""extra clear"" that Florida had a say in what happened. ""Maybe it wasn’t as necessary, but it's important to send the right message,"" Manuel said. ""If he wanted to vote against drilling, he should have voted for the Grayson amendment."" Graham said DeSantis casted the ""deciding vote against"" the state's right to protect Florida waters from drilling. There’s no question that DeSantis’ vote on an amendment to the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act was crucial, but saying DeSantis was the deciding vote goes too far. Technically, any of the 209 other people who voted against the bill could be considered the ""deciding vote."" Furthermore, the significance of Grayson’s amendment is a subject of debate. Democrats saw it as securing Florida’s right to protect Florida waters, whereas Republicans say the amendment wouldn’t have changed the powers of the state",Half True,"January 12, 2018"
"Says Evan ""Jenkins has the same positions on the issues as Joe Manchin: supporting Hillary (Clinton), supporting cap-and-trade, supporting Planned Parenthood, many tax increases.""","In the West Virginia Republican primary for U.S. Senate, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey accused his opponent, U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins, R-W.Va., of aligning with the Democratic incumbent. ""Jenkins has the same positions on the issues as Joe Manchin: supporting Hillary (Clinton), supporting cap-and-trade, supporting Planned Parenthood, many tax increases,"" Morrisey said in a radio interview on Oct. 12. Does Jenkins, a Republican, align with Manchin, a Democrat, on support for Clinton, cap-and-trade, Planned Parenthood and tax increases? First, it’s important to note that Jenkins has changed his party affiliation multiple times. He was initially registered as a Democrat, switched to Republican, and back to Democrat when he sought a seat in the House of Delegates in Cabell-Wayne County, W.Va., in 1993. He remained a Democrat until July 2013, when he switched back to the Republican Party to successfully challenge U.S. Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va. Manchin, on the other hand, is largely known as a conservative Democrat. We found that Jenkins doesn’t currently support the positions the ad mentioned, and in at least one case, Manchin didn’t either. Support? Manchin Jenkins Hillary Clinton Yes No Planned Parenthood Yes No Cap-and-trade No No Taxes Sometimes No In 2008, Manchin endorsed Barack Obama. He endorsed Clinton in 2016. Manchin even came out in Clinton’s support following her controversial comments that she would ""put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business"" if elected. ""I'm willing to take the flack because I believe in her,"" he said during a May 2016 roundtable. ""I know that's not in her heart, I know I've got two people I can count on, Hillary and Bill."" He took a step back in October 2017, calling her statement ""very harmful and very hard to justify or say."" ""It wouldn't be wise for Hillary to come to West Virginia,"" Manchin said. ""It wouldn't be a good thing for her or for me."" So while he took it down several notches, Manchin did support Clinton for president in 2016. Did Jenkins? Jenkins backed Trump in 2016. The Morrisey campaign said Jenkins supported Clinton in 2008 as evidenced by his attendance of a rally in her support. On July 27, 2007, Jenkins attended an economic policy town hall Clinton hosted at West Virginia State University. ""Any time you have a presidential candidate from any party come to the state, it's a time to rally the troops and energize those involved in the political process,"" Jenkins, then a Democratic state senator, said in the article the Morrisey campaign cited. ""It's important not to miss an opportunity to hear a candidate speak about the issues that matter to the people in this state,"" Jenkins added. The article did not mention Jenkins’ presidential preferences. Jenkins ""simply remarks that it is good for the state, and the civic engagement of its citizenry, when presidential candidates from any party come to West Virginia to talk policy,"" said Andy Sere, a spokesman for Jenkins. Jenkins attended a similar event for Bush in 2004, as a Democrat. ""Anytime you have a president in your hometown, when we have the national spotlight on West Virginia, on Huntington, on Marshall, that's a plus,"" Jenkins had told the Charleston Daily Mail. Morrisey’s campaign also said they believed Jenkins had voted for Clinton in the Democratic primary in 2008 because he had stated he didn’t support Obama but still voted. ""Evan skipped the presidential race on the primary ballot in 2008 because he didn’t support any of the Democratic candidates for president, which is why he voted for McCain in the general election,"" Sere said. ""In 2008 we had everything on the primary ballot, from the presidential primary all the way to county races,"" said Steven Adams, a spokesman for West Virginia Secretary of State’s Office. ""Jenkins certainly could have skipped the presidential race if he wanted to."" With no proof of having voted for Clinton or any public endorsements, we can’t say Jenkins aligns with Manchin on support for Clinton. Does Manchin support cap-and-trade policies? Manchin has campaigned on his opposition to cap-and-trade, appearing in a 2010 campaign ad for the U.S. Senate that showed him shooting at the text of the cap-and-trade bill. ""I’ll take dead aim at the cap-and-trade bill,"" he says in the video. But Morrisey’s campaign pointed to the Alternative and Renewable Energy Portfolio Act, a bill Jenkins voted for and Manchin passed as governor in 2009. Manchin came under fire for the act by his opponent in 2010, who called the law ""Obama’s cap-and-trade, West Virginia style."" However, as Factcheck.org pointed out, the act has little to do with the cap-and-trade legislation debated in Washington. Cap-and-trade legislation sets limits on emissions and then lets companies trade emission reduction credits. Energy portfolio standards, on the other hand, require utilities to get a certain share of their energy generation from different sources. This bill represented the latter, calling for 10 percent of the electricity generated by coal plants to come from ""alternative and renewable energy resources"" by 2015, and 25 percent by 2025. A variety of ""advanced coal technology"" processes actually fit under this umbrella, including electricity generated from waste coal and coal gasification and liquefaction. Bill Raney, the president of the West Virginia Coal Association, which represents most of the coal producers in the state and endorsed Manchin for Senate, found no issue with the law. When the law was repealed in 2015, the Charleston Gazette pointed out it had done little to hurt the coal industry or promote alternatives like wind energy or solar power. Morrisey’s campaign also used as evidence that in 1997, Jenkins sponsored HB 2476, a bill to create an emissions banking and trading program to incentivize better air quality. Patrick McGinley and James Van Nostrand, two environmental law experts at West Virginia University familiar with the law, disagreed. The 1997 bill lacks a cap on emissions, the critical feature of cap-and-trade legislation that generates scarcity in emission allowances, driving the market for trading emission credits. Manchin has gotten flack recently for his stance on Planned Parenthood, as he appeared in photos with constituents carrying both pro- and anti-Planned Parenthood signs. Manchin has voted both for and against defunding the group. Manchin says he’s personally anti-abortion but supports federal funding for Planned Parenthood contingent on the Hyde Amendment, which blocks federal funding for most abortion services. Jenkins, on the other side, has cast repeated votes to defund Planned Parenthood, including the ""No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act,"" ""Defund Planned Parenthood Act"" and the ""Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act,"" among others. The Morrisey campaign’s evidence of Jenkins’ support for Planned Parenthood was a 2006 Project Vote Smart issue survey on abortion where Jenkins did not indicate as a principle he supported prohibiting public funding of abortions and to organizations that advocate or perform abortions. ""Jenkins had an opportunity to say he did not support the taxpayer funding for abortion, just like he did with other abortion related policies – but he did not,"" said Nachama Soloveichik, a spokeswoman for Morrisey. The Jenkins campaign called the attack ""bogus,"" noting that the Project Vote Smart website itself said that a lack of response did not indicate opposition to a policy. Jenkins did not respond to the most recent survey. ""If a candidate does not select a response to any part or all of any question, it does not necessarily indicate that the candidate is opposed to that particular item,"" the page reads. Morrisey’s campaign said Manchin had voted for higher taxes during his Senate tenure. Manchin’s campaign declined to comment. We found that in 2012, Manchin voted for the ""Buffett Rule,"" which would have imposed a minimum effective tax rate for high-income taxpayers. He also supported Bowles-Simpson, an attempt to balance the budget that raises taxes. The Morrisey campaign couldn't point us to any federal tax increases that Jenkins had voted for while in Congress. Morrisey’s campaign instead pointed to multiple votes against local tax cuts, for example, cuts to hotel taxes or ending fees on such things as real estate transfers or license renewals. Outside those categories, they found up-votes on a tax on cigarettes and on waste coal production -- but little else to show the ""many tax increases"" Morrisey described in the radio interview. Morrisey said ""Jenkins has the same positions on the issues as Joe Manchin: supporting Hillary (Clinton), supporting cap-and-trade, supporting Planned Parenthood, many tax increases."" We found that Jenkins doesn’t support any of the positions the ad mentioned, and in at least one case, Manchin didn’t either. Manchin supported Clinton in 2016, but besides attending a policy town hall Clinton hosted, we found no evidence Jenkins supported her as a candidate in 2008. Unlike the ad suggests, Manchin is against cap-and-trade legislation, even taking aim at the text of the cap-and-trade bill in a campaign video. Experts agreed the 2007 West Virginia bill Manchin and Jenkins supported was not in line with Obama’s proposed cap-and-trade legislation, nor was the 1997 bill Jenkins co-sponsored. Manchin supports Planned Parenthood legislation as long as it doesn’t fund abortions, whereas Jenkins has repeatedly voted against funding the group. Finally, we found no evidence of ""many tax increases"" by either Manchin or Jenkins, although Manchin supported two proposals that would have increased taxes",Mostly False,"November 6, 2017"
"""Under his leadership, Tallahassee reduced its carbon intensity by roughly 40 percent.""","Editor's note: This fact-check was updated at 5:35 p.m. to reflect a 2015 report about the city's electric use. The update does not affect the rating. For months on his campaign website, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum took responsibility for shaving Tallahassee’s carbon footprint in his short time as mayor. ""Under his leadership, Tallahassee reduced its carbon intensity by roughly 40 percent,"" a post under the environmental issues page said. We wondered how Gillum accomplished this eye-popping statistic in just three years. But if you check the website now, you won’t find that claim. The Gillum campaign rolled back the talking point after PolitiFact Florida started looking into it, replacing it with a broader talking point that still leaves some questions unanswered. There is no evidence that supported a carbon cut of 40 percent under Gillum’s watch. In reality, the city has seen an estimated reduction in carbon emissions over the course of two decades. City of Tallahassee officials collect data on carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon (in terms of weight) emitted per unit of energy consumed. The city, which provides electric service to residents, keeps track of how much electricity is produced and monitors what’s ""coming out of the smokestacks"" at power plants to figure out the carbon intensity each year, said John Powell, Tallahassee environmental services and facilities director. Under federal law, the city is required to report its findings on an annual basis. Data from the city includes the amount of carbon measured in tons and the net electric load. The net electric load, or the NEL, is the amount of energy produced plus the energy purchased off the grid and minus what the city sells to the grid for use outside of their system. The data shows that the carbon intensity has dropped around 40 percent since 1990. The decline has not been consistent, but has decreased overall. ""We’ve implemented more efficient utilities and switched to cleaner fuels over the last two and half decades,"" Powell said. ""We really have seen reduction in carbon intensity over that time."" Susan Glickman, the Florida director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, a nonprofit advocate for sustainable energy policy, said there are other factors that could lead to a reduction in carbon emissions. For example, jobs in the coal industry have been declining since 1985. Because of this, a lot of utilities use more natural gas than coal, which is cleaner and cheaper. In addition, despite population gains, energy demand has gone down as appliances have become more efficient. The 2008 recession led to less energy being used. Gillum’s campaign changed the original claim on the website rather than defend it. ""You brought it to our attention and we wanted to make sure it was accurate, so we made the change when you reached out,"" said campaign spokesman Geoff Burgan said. ""We’re trying to get people the accurate information they need."" The updated post includes more nuance about the decrease in carbon intensity from initiatives Gillum has enacted as mayor since 2014. ""Over the last two decades,Tallahassee has reduced its carbon emission intensity by 40 percent, and under his leadership, has reduced the carbon footprint of electricity users in the city by 20 percent. The Mayor has worked both as Mayor and City Commissioner to implement and improve programs like free residential and commercial audits, low interest energy loans, and community outreach programs, as well (as) breaking ground on the new 120 acre solar farm that will triple the City’s solar energy capacity."" We looked for information to support the modified claim that under Gillum’s leadership, Tallahassee’s carbon footprint really decreased by 20 percent. We didn’t find much to illuminate that claim before we originally published this check. After publication (and repeated queries to Gillum’s spokespersons), the mayor’s community relations coordinator emailed PolitiFact a 2015 document that said electricity consumption in the city had dropped over a 10-year period ending in 2013, before Gillum became mayor. The statistic was included in a report about the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed Clean Power Plan pushed by the Obama administration. ""For the ten year period ending in 2013, the City’s residential customers experienced an estimated 21 percent reduction in the average electricity consumption,"" reads the 2015 report commissioned by the city. That overlaps with Gillum’s time as a city commissioner from 2003-14. (Tallahassee’s city commission is made up of four commissioners and the mayor. Every year, the commissioners and the mayor select a mayor pro-tempore.) So even though the city reduced its electricity use during that time, the drop can not be credited to Gillum. Further, recent data from the city shows that electricity consumption has gone down .1 percent from 2014-16, and the amount of carbon dioxide released has actually gone up 4 percent. It’s worth noting that Gillum has supported efforts to make the city greener. The most notable example happened in May when Tallahassee leaders, including Gillum, broke ground on a 120-acre solar farm located on Tallahassee International Airport land. The solar farm is expected to be completed by November 2017 and generate 20 megawatts of electricity — enough to power 3,400 homes, or 2 percent of the city’s current capacity. A post on Gillum’s campaign website said, ""Under his leadership, Tallahassee reduced its carbon intensity by roughly 40 percent."" That claim has since been removed and replaced with a series of different claims. That’s because there’s nothing to support a carbon reduction of that size in his time as mayor, or on the city commission. In reality, the cut has taken place over the course of two decades and has dropped for a variety of reasons outside of Gillum’s control",False,"October 12, 2017"
"Florida’s coastal and stormwater infrastructure are ""two of the most critical areas during a storm, and received D-plus and D ratings, respectively, by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2016.""","Gwen Graham, a former Democratic congresswoman running for Florida governor, said state leaders need to do more to prepare for the next hurricane, especially in the face of climate change. In an opinion-editorial for the Tampa Bay Times, Graham specifically focused on the state’s significant problem with infrastructure. ""Our coastal and stormwater infrastructure are not prepared to handle climate change,"" Graham wrote. ""They're two of the most critical areas during a storm, and received D-plus and D ratings, respectively, by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2016."" We wondered about these grades as well as Graham’s larger point about climate change preparedness. Every four years since 2008, the Florida Section of the American Society of Civil Engineers has issued a report card outlining the condition of Florida’s infrastructure. The organization was founded in 1852 and represents more than 150,000 members of the civil engineering profession in 177 countries, making it the oldest engineering society in the country. A committee of civil engineers updates the card and gives out 11 grades on different sectors of infrastructure, including bridges, energy and school facilities, to create an an average grade. (Florida’s grade point average was a C in 2016.) Florida’s highest marks were in ports (B-minus), aviation (B-minus) and bridges (B) in the group’s 2016 report card. As Graham said, coastal and stormwater infrastructure scored poorly. The worst grade, F, is given out to infrastructure with ""widespread advanced signs of deterioration,"" and designates that the infrastructure is unfit for what it’s supposed to do. Getting a D isn’t much better: ""The infrastructure is in poor to fair condition and mostly below standard, with many elements approaching the end of their service life. A large portion of the system exhibits significant deterioration. Condition and capacity are of serious concern with strong risk of failure."" The section about coastal areas takes a close look at the Sunshine State's 825 miles of beaches. That area received a D-plus grade in 2016, jsut like Graham said.  According to the organization, almost 61 percent of Florida’s beaches are eroding and need ""ongoing maintenance"" to fight the trend. The group put some of the fault on state policymakers, adding that ""over the last 10 years, the average difference between requested and state appropriated funds exceeded $40 million per year."" It shouldn’t come as a surprise that hurricanes and major storm events can really mess up coastal areas and beaches. During periods of extreme rain, the chance for flooding increases. Flooding combined with wind, leads to beach erosion and jeopardizes the integrity of important infrastructure, like power plants, along the coast. Florida’s stormwater infrastructure, which include the drains that capture excess rain water and transport it for cleaning, received a D. Based on the ASCE’s assessment, Florida needs about $1.1 billion through 2019 to update its stormwater infrastructure. However, as needs for improvement have increased, utility fees to upkeep the systems have decreased since 2011. Stormwater infrastructure is put into overdrive during storms and hurricanes. Increasing the amount of water compromises the natural ability of the ground to absorb water, making stormwater systems function worse. There’s no doubt that stormwater and coastal area infrastructure are critical when a storm hits, and experts agreed that the ASCE’s assessment is right on track. Experts said that coastal infrastructure does not work well under ""king"" tides, heavy storms, or heavy rains in part because of the state's low elevation, lack of pumping of water and some lack of attention. ""Stormwater (issues), like water and sewer, are not very glamorous and are therefore often ignored until they hit crisis mode,"" said Fred Bloetscher, an American Society of Civil Engineers member and a civil, environmental and geomatics engineering professor at Florida Atlantic University. Experts also agreed that the crux of Graham’s claim — that Florida's coastal and stormwater infrastructure is not prepared to handle climate change — is also accurate. That’s in part because the state isn’t taking preventative measures to better prepare. For example, experts said a starting point for Florida would be to tighten building codes and increase the number of ""disaster reduction structures."" Experts at the University of South Florida pointed to the ""monolithic concrete dome home"" that easily withstands hurricane winds and flooding events. ""We wonder why we don't see more of these,"" said T.H. Culhane, the director of climate change and sustainability at the University of South Florida. But not all hope is lost, according to Dave Randle, USF's director of sustainable tourism. ""It might be too late for the next hurricane but the sooner we start the more we could prevent damage in the future,"" Randle said. Graham said that Florida’s coastal area and stormwater infrastructure are not prepared to handle climate change, adding that the state ""received D-plus and D ratings, respectively, by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2016."" Graham is accurately citing a report card given out by the oldest engineering society in the country and experts vouched for the group’s assessment and Graham’s larger point. Florida has failed to take preventative measures in the past and it needs to update its existing infrastructure to prepare for climate change",True,"September 25, 2017"

"""Hurricane Irma could be a Category 6 by the time it hits East Coast.""","A hurricane with winds in excess of 180 miles per hour is scary enough. But some corners of the Internet are stirring additional panic -- and attracting additional clicks -- by referring to an extreme hurricane category that doesn’t even exist. The web post appeared as Hurricane Irma was powering through the Caribbean, days ahead of an expected landfall somewhere in Florida. The storm was one of the most powerful to form in the Atlantic Ocean in decades, with sustained winds as high as 185 miles per hour. Into this maelstrom came a website posing as an arm of CNN (spoiler, it’s not) posting a page headlined, ""HURRICANE IRMA could be a Category 6 by the time it hits East Coast."" The advertising-filled page has almost no content of its own -- just an audio recording of a folksy, older-sounding woman rambling, stream-of-consciousness style, about the approach of Irma. At one point, she says, ""The wind speeds are way up there into the category 6 territory."" A flurry of other questionable websites also played with the idea of Irma becoming a Category 6 storm. There is no such thing. The scale used by the National Hurricane Center only goes as high as 5. The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale was developed by Herbert Saffir, an engineer in Coral Gables, Fla., and Robert Simpson, who headed the National Hurricane Center from 1967 to 1973. The scale used wind speeds as a guide to predict the extent of structural damage. ""Saffir, an engineer and expert on wind damage who helped write the Dade County, Fla., building code, developed the first version of the scale in 1971 for a United Nations report on construction that could stand up to high winds,"" wrote Jack Williams the founding weather editor of USA Today and co-author of Hurricane Watch: Forecasting the Deadliest Storms on Earth. As for Simpson, Williams wrote, one of his formative experiences at the National Hurricane Center came with the approach of Hurricane Camille to the Mississippi coast on Aug. 16, 1969. The storm was shaping up to be extremely dangerous, but Simpson grappled with the best way to communicate this to residents in the storm’s path. ""Simpson broke the Weather Bureau's rule against using specific wind speed or surge figures in forecasts -- they were supposed to say things such as ‘strong winds and dangerously high water are expected,’ "" Williams wrote. ""After it was all over, despite the success of the evacuations, Simpson felt he needed a better way to communicate what a storm is capable of doing. He correlated Saffir's wind damage rankings with the surge potential to create the scale used today."" While officials at the National Hurricane Center began using Simpson’s new scale internally, it only began releasing it to the public in 1975, amid clamor by the media for an easily understandable metric. Officially, the Saffir-Simpson scale is based on a hurricane's sustained wind speed. ""Hurricanes reaching Category 3 and higher are considered major hurricanes because of their potential for significant loss of life and damage,"" according to the National Hurricane Center. ""Category 1 and 2 storms are still dangerous, however, and require preventative measures."" The now-familiar scale of 1 to 5 breaks down as follows: Category Sustained winds (mph) Types of damage 1 74-95 Very dangerous winds will produce some damage 2 96-110 Extremely dangerous winds will cause extensive damage 3 111-129 Devastating damage will occur 4 130-156 Catastrophic damage will occur 5 157+ Catastrophic damage will occur The scale has changed in one significant way over the years. In 2010, the federal agency removed references to storm surge from the scale after some surge expectations proved to be off-base. (Storm surge refers to how far open waters reach beyond their normal levels on coastal land.) Instead, the center directs people to more specific forecasts about storm surge. Unlike the Fujita scale for tornadoes, which runs from 0 to 5, the Saffir-Simpson scale uses measurements taken before a storm hits land. The Fujita ratings are assigned after a storm has hit and the damage is investigated. From time to time, there has been discussion of whether a new category -- Category 6 -- should be added to the scale. That decision would likely fall to the National Hurricane Center after discussions with scientists in the field, said Jill Trepanier, a hurricane specialist in the Louisiana State University department of geography and anthropology. A simple extrapolation from the existing categories would probably set the threshold for a new Category 6 around 180 mph, making Irma a good candidate for that category if it existed, said James B. Elsner, the chair of geography at Florida State University who also runs a business called Climatek that develops software for hurricane and tornado risk models. The idea of creating a Category 6 is often met with skepticism, however. The most frequently cited reason is that Category 6 would add nothing to the understanding of how destructive the storm would be for buildings and other structures. ""Almost no structures can withstand sustained winds over 155 mph,"" said Michael M. Bell, an associate professor in atmospheric science at Colorado State University. ""At those wind speeds, significant damage or even total destruction of most buildings is expected. By this definition, adding a Category 6 would not add any new information, since the strongest criteria for expected wind damage has already been met."" Bill Read, the former director of the National Hurricane Center, agreed in an email with PolitiFact. And the scale’s co-creator, Simpson, agreed as well, in a 1991 interview. Asked whether the scale should be modified to include categories above 5, he said that above 155 mph, ""it's going to cause rupturing damages (to buildings) that are serious no matter how well it's engineered. … That's the reason why we didn't try to go any higher than that anyway."" In fact, several scientists said that a more useful change, if one had to be made, would be to focus less on wind speed specifically, either by modifying the Saffir-Simpson scale to include other factors or by giving added attention to other measurements. ""I personally believe that we need to work on effectively communicating the other hazards that tropical cyclones bring, including heavy rainfall and storm surge,"" Bell said. Hurricane Harvey, which hit coastal Texas, ""did cause significant wind damage as a Category 4, but much of the devastation in Houston and the surrounding areas was caused by inland flooding from sustained rainfall while Harvey was a tropical storm."" Similarly, ""much of the damage from Hurricane Katrina was caused by storm surge when the winds were Category 3,"" Bell said. ""These multiple hazards may not be well-correlated with the Saffir-Simpson Category at landfall, and therefore it is an incomplete description of the storm's destructive potential."" Trepanier said there’s no reason why a Category 6 is needed to communicate how fearsome Irma is. ""Irma is a beast,"" she said. ""It is safe to say the wind speeds are rare, but I see no benefit in calling it a Category 6. It should be considered catastrophic. And that is how people should refer to it."" So, as of now, there is no such thing as a Category 6 storm",False Pants on Fire,"September 6, 2017"
"Says Manny Pacquiao, Usain Bolt and Princes William and Harry have donated tens of millions of dollars to Hurricane Harvey victims.","Three similarly worded posts published on News360-tv.com said Manny Pacquiao, Usain Bolt and Princes William and Harry had each donated tens of millions of dollars to Hurricane Harvey victims. They haven’t. Pacquiao, a Filipino boxer and politician, was said to have spent $50 million to rebuild Houston. Princes Harry and William were said to have given $100 million to assist and house victims of the flood. And Bolt, an Olympic sprinter, was said to have spent a whopping $150 million on hurricane relief.

"Says Marco Rubio took ""three quarters of a million dollars from fossil fuel executives"" during the 2016 Senate election.","A college student and climate activist interrupted U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio during a recent speech to question Rubio's ties to the energy industry. September Porras, a Swarthmore college student who is a member of the Sunrise Movement, a national group of climate change activists, challenged Rubio's links to fossil fuels at the Seminole County GOP fundraiser held at a hotel in Altamonte Springs on Aug. 22. Here is a partial transcript of the exchange: Porras: ""Senator, if you really care about young Americans, why did you take three-quarters of a million dollars from fossil fuel executives in your last Senate election?"" Rubio: ""I’m so glad I live in America where she can say that, in a lot of countries you go to jail, I am grateful that I live in America where ... (applause drowns out a few words) ... I don’t have a problem with protesters..."" Porras: ""I’m not a protester, I just want to know why you aren’t answering our questions."" Rubio: ""I don’t have a problem with hecklers. I don’t have a problem with any of that. You know why? Because one of the issues I am working on now involves nations where that’s not possible,"" a reference to his work related to U.S. policy on Cuba and Venezuela. ""I am grateful that I live in a nation where people can disagree, I am grateful that I live in a nation where people get to vote every two to four years. I am grateful that I live in a place where people can speak their minds and they can settle their differences at a ballot box."" Rubio then made a call for the United States to achieve energy independence: ""I believe as a cornerstone of allowing us to succeed economically we need to be able to power a 21st century economy, and I believe technological advances are making that energy more efficient and cleaner than ever before. I absolutely believe that America needs to be energy independent. We are crazy as a nation if we don’t utilize all of the resources that God’s blessed this great land with and I will continue to be a strong supporter of that."" The part of the exchange we will fact-check is whether Rubio took three-quarters of a million dollars from fossil fuel executives during his 2016 Senate bid. We did not hear back from Rubio’s spokespersons. Porras told PolitiFact that she obtained the dollar amount from the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent clearinghouse for campaign finance data that publishes its data at opensecrets.org. The center’s data for the top 20 recipients of oil and gas donations during the 2016 cycle showed that Rubio received $753,201. That amount put Rubio in fourth place for oil and gas donations behind three other presidential candidates: U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Separately, the center compiled industry donations for the Florida Senate candidates in 2016. That analysis shows that Rubio received $524,877 from oil and gas. Rubio received more money from six other sectors, including retirees, security/investment and Republican/conservative. Over Rubio’s career as a federal candidate and politician between 2009-18, he has taken $1.1 million from oil and gas. (Porras cited Rubio’s oil and gas donations but coal is also a fossil fuel. The Center of Responsive Politics found Rubio got $48,800 from the coal industry in 2016.) Compiling Rubio’s donations during the 2016 cycle is complicated because he ran in two elections -- presidential and Senate. The Center for Responsive Politics provided PolitiFact with a more specific breakdown for his oil and gas donations: $339,194 - to his presidential campaign $207,500 - to outside groups that supported both his presidential and Senate runs $271,571 - to his Senate campaign and leadership PAC That adds up to $818,265. That’s higher than the other totals shown for Rubio because it is the center’s most up to date analysis. So the dollar amount cited by Porras is valid, but while she referenced Rubio’s ""last Senate election"" the amount she cited included some donations to his presidential campaign. Another caveat: Porras said that the donations to Rubio were from ""executives"" but the donations could be broader than that. The donations reflects contributions from any individuals who list their employer as an oil and gas firm as well as as corporations and unions who donate from their treasuries. However, the vast majority of money reported to the Federal Election Commission comes from executives, CEOs and PACs, said Sarah Bryner, research director at the Center for Responsive Politics.   The donations don’t include external lobbyists who represent a whole host of interests, not just oil and gas, but it would include an in-house lobbyist for an oil company. Donations from the oil and gas industry have generally been increasing over the past decade, particularly in presidential cycles. The donations peaked at about $103 million in 2016, with about 88 percent going to Republican candidates. Rubio has previously called for the United States to become energy independent, and that includes the use of oil and gas. He criticized international climate efforts, as well as President Barack Obama’s regulatory measures. ""If you’re overly dependent on any one source of fuel, then you become vulnerable to disruption,"" he said at an event in January 2016. ""I want America to truly have a truly all-of-the-above strategy."" A heckler said that Rubio took ""three quarters of a million dollars from fossil fuel executives"" during the 2016 Senate election. While the heckler was referencing Rubio’s Senate election, that amount also includes donations to his presidential race. That's an important distinction, because presidential fundraising tends to draw more donations. The figure comes from an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics which found that Rubio received $753,201 during the 2016 cycle",Half True,"August 29, 2017"

"California and New York are ""the two biggest polluting states in the country.""","Gov. Chris Sununu says he’s proud of his state’s record of environmental stewardship. The Republican says New Hampshire will take care of its natural resources with or without a demand from Paris or Washington, D.C. When he was asked whether he’d sign onto the United States Climate Alliance – a state-level agreement to uphold the objectives of the Paris climate accord developed after the U.S. withdrew from the latter – he bristled. In an interview with New Hampshire Public Radio, Sununu said the climate alliance is ""quasi-meaningless"" and ""more of just a political statement than anything."" He specifically called out its founders, the governors of California and New York, saying their motive in championing the U.S. Climate Alliance was to distract from their states’ shortcomings. ""That piece of paper that folks wanted me to sign – think about where it came from,"" Sununu told the public radio station. ""It came from the governors of New York and California, the two biggest polluting states in the country."" PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to take a closer look at the biggest polluting states in the country. Clarifying the statement Sununu made the statement in response to a listener’s question about climate change and the Paris accord, which suggests that his ""biggest polluting states"" remark was a reference to carbon dioxide or greenhouse gas emissions. But he also discussed other types of pollution. Before he was the CEO of a ski mountain or the governor, Sununu received a degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in civil and environmental engineering and worked as an environmental engineer cleaning up waste sites. He said he brings ""more environmental experience to the governor’s office than any governor in the history of the state."" His work cleaning up hazardous waste sites in California showed him first-hand, he said, ""It’s deplorable what they’ve done in parts of that state – or New York up in some of those rivers."" So what exactly is the measure he’s using to define the ""biggest polluting states?"" Carbon dioxide? Greenhouse gases in general? Other air pollutants? Water pollutants? We asked his press secretary, Ben Vihstadt, for data to support the claim. Vihstadt cited a study by the Energy Information Administration, a division of the U.S. Department of Energy, that specifically looks at energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. The data The study that Vihstadt cited shows state-by-state data collected as recently as 2014. In his email, he softened the governor’s original claim, saying instead that the study showed California and New York ""are two of the top polluting states in the country"" – not the top two. With its 642 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted in 2014, Texas is head and shoulders above the rest of the country. It was responsible for 11.9 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions covered in the study. And Texas had nothing at all to do with the Climate Alliance letter. California, one of our subjects, comes in at No. 2 with 358 million tons, or 6.6 percent of the total. New York is No. 9 with 170 million tons, or 3.1 percent. By comparison, New Hampshire is 46th on this list, with a measly 15 million tons that represent less than 0.3 percent of the total. It’s worth noting that California and New York have been effectively reducing their carbon dioxide emissions over time, according to the EIA study. Texas’s annual emissions are 14 percent higher than they were in 1990, but California and New York each emitted lower amounts of carbon dioxide in 2014 than they did in 1990. New York’s 2014 emissions were 21 percent lower than the state’s 2004 peak. So both the states we’re investigating are near the top on this scale. But we reached out to a handful of researchers and professors in environmental science who urged us to consider the question in other ways. ""In general, California and New York are among the largest states, so the absolute numbers will be large for them,"" said Sergey Paltsev, a senior research scientist for the MIT Energy Initiative and MIT Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research. Brian Soden, a professor in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Miami, suggested analyzing carbon dioxide emissions per capita or per gross domestic product to equalize population and production differences between states. Per capita The same Energy Information Administration study also breaks down the data on a per-capita basis, as the scientists recommended. In this view, California and New York – the first and third most populous states – are at the complete other end of the spectrum. Of the 51 states, including Washington, D.C., California and New York have the second and third lowest per-capita energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. The EIA study notes: ""Many factors contribute to variation in the amount of emissions per capita, including climate, the structure of the state economy, population density, energy sources, building standards and explicit state policies to reduce emissions."" Wyoming earns its No. 1 per-capita rank by being the least populous state and the second-largest energy producer, the EIA study says. New York, on the other hand, had fewer than one-tenth the carbon dioxide emissions per-capita compared with Wyoming. ""A large portion of the population is located in the New York City metropolitan area where mass transit is readily available and most residences are multi-family units that provide efficiencies of scale in terms of energy for heating and cooling. The New York economy is oriented towards low-energy-consuming activities such as financial markets,"" the study says, adding, ""New York's energy prices are relatively high ... which in turn encourages energy savings."" In addition to being low carbon dioxide emitters per capita, California and New York are also among the lowest carbon dioxide emitters relative to gross domestic product. New Hampshire, by comparison, is the 12th lowest emitter on a per-capita basis and 11th lowest relative to GDP. Our ruling Sununu said California and New York are ""the two biggest polluting states in the country."" His press secretary tried to soften the claim, but no matter how you look at it, that’s not accurate. In terms of absolute carbon dioxide emissions, California and New York rank No. 2 and No. 9. Texas is No. 1. Adjusting for population and GDP, California and New York are actually among the most effective states at reducing their impact on the atmosphere – beating even Sununu’s home state of New Hampshire. It turns out, Sununu was just blowing smoke",Mostly False,"July 28, 2017"
"""While California’s population has doubled since the 1970s, we haven’t completed a single major (water) storage project in that time.""","One of the biggest backers for building new dams and reservoirs in California is House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield. The Republican, who’s been described as the most powerful Californian in Washington D.C., recently spoke on the House floor in favor of a bill to speed up studies on five water storage projects in the state. ""Water is not optional. Not in my district. Not in California. Not anywhere,"" McCarthy told his colleagues. ""But over the past five years my constituents have struggled to survive without life-giving water in the face of a catastrophic drought."" As part of his push for the bill, H.R. 23, McCarthy made a claim about the dearth of water storage construction in the state in recent decades.  McCarthy makes his statement at about the 1:35 minute mark.  ""While California’s population has doubled since the 1970s, we haven’t completed a single major storage project in that time,"" McCarthy said. ""Now that’s worth restating. With California’s population having doubled since the 1970s we have not completed a single major storage project in that time. How can California grow and thrive in the future if we depend on inadequate infrastructure from nearly 50 years go?"" Not a single major water storage project since the 1970s? We wondered: Does the congressman’s claim hold water? We set out on a fact check. Our research In April 2016, we rated Mostly True a related though somewhat different claim by Sen. Feinstein. She said California had ""the same water infrastructure"" as it did in the 1960s. Our research showed large portions of the state’s modern-day water system, including the State Water Project and the federal government’s Central Valley Project, were built mainly in the 1960s or earlier. Construction started in the late 1950s on the State Water Project, a massive set of reservoirs, aqueducts and pumping plants that store and deliver water up and down the state to 25 million Californians. The backbone of the project, including Lake Oroville and the California Aqueduct, was finished in the 1960s and early 1970s. The Central Valley Water Project, which irrigates the San Joaquin Valley, was started in the late 1930s and completed in the early 1970s. This evidence mostly supported Feinstein’s claim. But we also found that regional water districts constructed several significant storage projects in the 1990s and that a new part of the state’s water infrastructure, a large ocean desalination plant, was built two years ago in San Diego County. Using that fact check as a reference, we zeroed in on McCarthy’s claim. McCarthy’s claim The first portion of the congressman’s statement, about California’s population doubling since the 1970s, is basically correct. In 1970, the state was home to 19.9 million people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. As of July 2016, California’s population was 39.3 million. The second portion of McCarthy’s claim about the lack of major water storage projects built since the 1970s is open to broader interpretation. Asked for evidence to support that part of the statement, McCarthy’s spokesman told us by email that ""the last major (1M+ acre-feet) reservoir/dam we built in CA was in 1978 and it was New Melones Reservoir."" The spokesman did not explain why only reservoirs with a capacity of one million acre-feet or more are considered ""major."" One acre-foot of water equals about 326,000 gallons. The average California household uses between one-half and one acre-foot of water per year. The capacity at New Melones, which sits on the Stanislaus River in the central Sierra Nevada foothills, is 2.4 million acre-feet. Its dam was, indeed, completed in 1978 by the federal government, according to the U.S. Department of Reclamation. But was that really California’s last major water storage project? Is it fair to describe only those projects with a capacity larger than one million acre-feet as major? And are dams and reservoirs the only way the state adds to its water supply? Given that his spokesman cited New Melones, one might interpret McCarthy’s statement as meaning the federal government hasn’t built any major water storage projects in California since the 1970s. The congressman, however, doesn’t make this point clear in his speech. Given the broad nature of the claim, we took it to mean no layer of government has built a large-scale storage project in decades. Experts weigh in Based on interviews with water experts, we found there’s some truth to McCarthy’s assertion. We also found it omits some key information and takes things out of context. California has not constructed any new statewide water storage projects to match the scale of those started in the 1950s under the State Water Project. For some context, the largest reservoirs on that system are Lake Shasta, with a capacity of 4.5 million acre-feet, and Lake Oroville, with a capacity of 3.5 million acre-feet. The bill supported by McCarthy would advance proposed reservoirs such as Temperance Flat on the San Joaquin River in Fresno County and Sites, an offstream reservoir in the Sacramento Valley west of Colusa. Both would have a capacity of more than one million acre-feet. ""It is true that the federal and state governments have not added much,"" said Jay Lund, director of the UC Davis Center for Watershed Sciences. ""But local and regional efforts have been quite effective, without new federal storage projects."" Lund said McCarthy’s statement ""is missing a lot of new functional storage,"" in the form of groundwater projects. One such project, the Kern Water Bank, is expected to store 400,000 acre-feet of water this year, Lund said. Recent projects Here’s a look at some of the largest water storage projects built in California since the 1970s: Diamond Valley Lake in Riverside County is the largest reservoir in Southern California. It was completed in 2000 by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and holds up to 800,000 acre feet of water, ""almost as big as Folsom (Lake),"" Lund noted. Lake Sonoma, a reservoir in Sonoma County, was constructed in 1983. It has a capacity of 381,000 acre feet. New Spicer Meadow reservoir was completed in 1989. It sits on a tributary of the Stanislaus River and holds up to 189,000 acre-feet of water. Los Vaqueros Reservoir, completed in 1998 by the Contra Costa Water District near Brentwood. It holds 160,000 acre feet. Peter Gleick of the Pacific Institute, an Oakland-based think tank that advocates for sustainable water policies, said in an interview that McCarthy’s statement ""is just wrong."" He explained that California has continued to build smaller but still significant water storage projects in recent decades while adopting new water supply strategies. In a 2009 column in the San Francisco Chronicle, Gleick wrote the state had added more than 1.6 million acre-feet of water storage since 1979. ""And these numbers don’t include new groundwater storage systems or the vast ‘reservoirs’ of saved water we’ve created through conservation and efficiency programs. Are we adding new traditional storage more and more slowly? Yes. We’ve built on all the good dam sites."" Our ruling House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy recently claimed California hasn’t completed a single major water storage project since the 1970s. His claim is partially accurate. Nothing built since that time compares with the massive reservoirs built in the 1950s and 60s as part of the State Water Project. That doesn’t mean California hasn’t added anything of significance. Regional water districts have built large projects including the 800,000 acre-foot Diamond Valley Lake, built in 2000, the largest reservoir in Southern California. To describe ""major"" water storage projects, McCarthy’s spokesman used what amounts to an arbitrary marker of those with the capacity of one million acre-feet or more. But as water policy experts point out, California has continued to build water storage on a smaller but still significant scale. It’s also adopted new water supply strategies, including groundwater storage and conservation. McCarthy’s statement ignores these important facts and context",Half True,"July 18, 2017"
"""Most likely the primary control knob (for the earth’s temperature) is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in.""","Energy Secretary Rick Perry downplayed the role of human activity in the recent rise in the Earth’s temperature, saying natural causes are likely the main driver of climate change. Perry was asked in a CNBC interview if he believed carbon dioxide was the ""primary control knob"" for the earth’s temperature. ""No. Most likely the primary control knob is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in,"" Perry said in the June 19 interview. We decided to investigate Perry’s claim about climate change’s main cause, which scientists have likened to a ""control knob."" Perry’s claim flies in the face of settled science. The world’s leading authority on climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has concluded that human activity is ""extremely likely"" to be the main driver of warming since the mid 20th century. While it’s still possible to find dissenters, scientists around the globe generally agree with this conclusion. The graph below, based on work by NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, shows just how closely human activity syncs with the earth’s rising temperature, especially since 1950. The blue line shows how human factors (land use, ozone, aerosols and greenhouse gases) have contributed to global warming. The black line is the Earth’s recorded temperature since 1880.  This is not to say natural factors don’t affect the climate. They do. But Perry is wrong to call them the main cause of the earth’s rising temperature. When you look at how natural causes (orbital and solar changes plus volcanic activity) have contributed to climate change, it’s clear the impact is less than that of human factors.  Perry is also wrong to say ocean waters are responsible for the uptick in temperature. While oceans are a vital part of the climate system, and variations in their circulation can affect local climates in important ways, they don’t account for global warming, said Gavin Schmidt, climatologist and director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. ""We have concluded close to all of the recent trends in global temperature is due to human activity, and CO2 is the dominant factor,"" Schmidt said, referring to carbon dioxide.

""If you asked them what the increase was, they wouldn't be able to tell you that every single year that there's an increase, it is within the margin of error, meaning it isn’t increasing,"" Gutfeld said June 2 on the show he co-hosts, The Five. ""So, those are called real truths,"" he continued. ""The poetic truth is the chaos and the hysteria, because that plays to the media. And it makes you feel so important. And you get to punish America for being so successful by doing these stupid deals. But if you read the facts about the high temperatures, about the reality of our past, it is all B.S."" Gutfeld made the statement on The Five as the panel discussed President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement. We interviewed several scientists who said Gutfeld’s statement -- that temperature increases are within the margin of error and therefore not increasing --  is wrong. Rather than point to ""single year"" increases, experts said that long-term trends clearly show the temperature has been rising for decades. Robert Jackson, chair of the department of Earth System Science at Stanford, said Gutfeld’s statement, scientifically speaking, ""is rubbish."" There are two main sources of data cited to look at temperature trends: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the NASA Goddard institute for Space Studies. Both show a trend of rising temperatures. Rising temperatures should be measured over many years A Fox News spokeswoman sent us articles stating that 2016 data on rising temperatures was deceptive because of ""uncertainty in the statistics"" or because news reports hid information on the margin of error. Gutfeld focused on ""single year"" increases. Such comparisons don’t tell the full story about rising temperature, because there is natural variability year over year. It is more useful to look at long-term trends such as comparing decades, said University of Miami’s Ben Kirtman. The statement by Gutfeld ""indicates a profound misunderstanding of climate science and statistics,"" Kirtman said. ""Year over year you can’t be sure that one year is a statistically separate warming from the previous year, so you have to take a little bit longer view to remove some of the natural fluctuation,"" he said. But by looking at climate data over decades, it shows a clear rise in temperatures. NASA tracks the annual temperature anomaly which means a change, up or down, from a long-term average. NASA’s latest annual data released in January 2017 shows that temperatures have been rising upward since the 1960s:    In January 2017, NASA reported that the Earth’s 2016 surface temperatures were the warmest since modern recordkeeping began in 1880, according to independent analyses by NASA and NOAA. Globally-averaged temperatures in 2016 were 1.78 degrees Fahrenheit (0.99 degrees Celsius) warmer than the mid-20th century mean -- making 2016 the third year in a row to set a new record for global average surface temperatures, NASA concluded. NASA stated that even taking into account the uncertainties in the interpretation of year-to-year temperature differences, NASA estimated 2016 was the warmest year with greater than 95 percent certainty. NASA attributed the rising temperatures driven largely by ""increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere."" Most of the warming occurred in the past 35 years, with 16 of the 17 warmest years on record occurring since 2001. According to NASA, for recent years the margin of error is about ±0.05 degrees Celsius. Uncertainties can arise in the data due to different methods in dealing with missing data and weighting the two hemispheres; however, the uncertainty is quite small, said Kevin Trenberth, a  Distinguished Senior Scientist in the Climate Analysis Section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Trenberth said that 2014 was the warmest on record at that point, but perhaps not outside uncertainty. But 2015 broke that record well outside the uncertainty, and then 2016 further broke that record, again well outside any uncertainty.  So 2014-16 are the warmest three years on record, he said. Reto A. Ruedy, an expert at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said Gutfeld’s statement ""lacks any logic."" ""It argues that anything that changes less than the margin of error within some arbitrarily selected time interval (here a year) necessarily does not change,"" he said. ""By the same logic you can argue that babies don’t grow in size, since within a day or even a week they grow less than the margin of error in determining their size."" The long-term trend which shows an overall rise in temperature since 1880, said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado. ""Gutfeld uses flawed logic to claim that there is no trend. But there is a trend,"" he said.  ""The lesson here?  Always look at the actual data."" Our ruling Gutfeld said, ""every single year that there's an increase (in temperature) it's within the margin of error -- meaning it isn't increasing."" While some years are within the margin, others definitely aren't, so Gutfeld is wrong when he says ""every single"" year is within the margin of error. Also, long-term trends over decades show that temperatures are clearly rising. So Gutfeld is wrong both on the details and and the big picture",False Pants on Fire,"June 9, 2017"
"""The Earth is 6,000 years old, that’s a fact.""","During a May 11, 2017 hearing on his bill to create tougher penalties for college students who disrupt public speakers, Wisconsin state Rep. Jesse Kremer, R-Kewaskum, had this exchange with state Rep. Terese Berceau, D-Madison: Berceau: So, my question is, if a geology student says, ""I’m sorry, but the Earth is only 6,000 years old"" -- rejecting science that says that the Earth is considerably older than that -- is it not OK for a professor to tell that student that they’re wrong? Kremer: So, this bill stays out of the classroom. Yes, the Earth is 6,000 years old, that’s a fact. But, we can discuss that outside of this room. (He chuckles.) Berceau: You said that it is a fact, you do believe it’s a fact? Kremer: Yeah, I do. While the idea that the Earth is 6,000 years old is an article of faith for some, in this context Kremer presented it as a knowable fact. Let’s take a look. Kremer and his bills Kremer, who represents a rural area northwest of Milwaukee, is known for proposing legislation that is, in his words, ""red meat for conservatives"". For example, to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy; place gender restrictions on school bathrooms and locker rooms; and allow concealed carry permit-holders to carry guns on public school grounds and college campuses. Kremer introduced the speech bill six days before the hearing, which was held by a state Assembly committee. It would require the state’s Board of Regents to adopt a policy for Wisconsin’s public colleges that includes ""a range of disciplinary sanctions for anyone under an institution's jurisdiction who engages in violent, abusive, indecent, profane, boisterous, obscene, unreasonably loud, or other disorderly conduct that interferes with the free expression of others."" A student violator could face a one-semester suspension or expulsion for a second offense. The bill, which is expected to be taken up by the Assembly in June 2017, comes as free speech issues have grown more contentious on college campuses across the country, fostering concerns among Republicans that conservative speakers aren’t treated equally. The Capital Times reported on Kremer’s 6,000 statement from the hearing on June 7, 2017, triggering national news stories. Coincidentally, the same day, scientists reported on the discovery of fossils in Morocco that date back roughly 300,000 years, indicating that mankind evolved earlier than had been known. The scientific consensus is that the Earth itself is much older than that. The Earth’s age The topic never seems to get old. 2014: Facebook posts about two Republican U.S. senators and former presidential candidates claimed in part that Marco Rubio of Florida believes the Earth is 9,000 years old and that Rand Paul of Kentucky believes it is 10,000 years old. Neither had made such statements, and PolitiFact National’s rating on the posts was Pants on Fire. 2015: A talk that then-GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson gave four years earlier made news. He had said in 2011: ""I am not a hard-and-fast person who says the Earth is only 6,000 years old,"" but, ""I do believe in the six-day creation."" 2017: The Washington Post’s Dear Science column answered the question: How do we know how old the Earth is? The answer: ""Scientists now know the Earth is actually 4.54 billion years old, an age built on many lines of evidence from the geologic record."" Smithsonian.com and the scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey (based on very old rocks, of course) also say around 4.5 billion. But Kremer is far from alone in his belief. The 6,000 figure Many attribute the 6,000 figure to James Ussher (1581–1656), an Irish archbishop who concluded that Adam was created in 4004 B.C. He made his calculation, in part, by counting the number of generations in the Bible. An Institute for Creation Research article says, however, that the work in which Ussher made the estimate contains 12,000 footnotes from secular sources, as well as 2,000 references from the Bible, indicating, the article says, that most of his evidence was non-biblical. And the magazine Wired once observed: Ussher was far from the first person to wildly miscalculate the universe’s age ….Among others to try their hand were Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton, both of whom arrived at estimates younger than Ussher’s.  All labored without a number of modern tools — not only for measuring radioactive decay or rates of the universal expansion, but an intellectual framework for conceiving of time on scales beyond the biblical.

That wouldn’t exist for another century, when a Scottish farmer and geological enthusiast named James Hutton, looking at riverbank stone formations, saw a record of sedimentary deposition that couldn’t be contained in 6,000 years. Or many times that. That was a radical idea, and it took another century to be widely accepted, even in the scientific community. Kremer told us his statement is based on his ""deeply held religious beliefs, and thus First Amendment freedom of religion and expression, can be found here based on sound biblical and historical evidence."" He pointed us to an AnswersInGenesis.org article that also cites Ussher and concludes in part: Cultures around the world give an age of the Earth that confirms what the Bible teaches. Radiometric dates, on the other hand, have been shown to be wildly in error. The age of the Earth ultimately comes down to a matter of trust — it’s a worldview issue. But geology and environmental science professor Nelson Ham at St. Norbert University, a Catholic college in De Pere, Wis., told us: ""Kremer's statement is certainly not a scientific fact,"" noting the many estimates of around 4.5 billion years. ""Determining that age has come from measurements that are testable and repeatable, following the scientific method."" Our rating Kremer says: ""The Earth is 6,000 years old, that’s a fact."" Kremer states a biblical belief, but goes too far in describing it as a fact. It’s a matter of settled science that the Earth is much older, with the current consensus being that it is about 4.5 billion years of age",False,"June 8, 2017"
"""70 percent of Florida is in drought today.""","Former Vice President Al Gore said that the global community will have to continue to respond to climate change after President Donald Trump’s ""reckless"" decision to pull out of the Paris climate change agreement. Gore said that evidence abounds that climate change is real (it is ), and people ""don’t have to rely on the virtually unanimous opinion of the scientific community anymore."" ""Mother nature is telling us every night on the TV news now is like a nature hike through the book of Revelation,"" Gore said on Fox News Sunday on June 4. ""People are noticing this, these downpours and historic floods. We’ve had 11 once-in-a-thousand-year downpours in the U.S. just in the last 10 years. We’ve got these wildfires that become mega fires now. Seventy percent of Florida is in drought today. Missouri declared an emergency just a couple of days ago because of another one of these. And they keep on coming."" Gore correctly cited a drought figure for Florida from a commonly used drought index. We will explain what that index shows and what the drought means in Florida. A spokeswoman for Gore said that he was citing the United States Drought Monitor, a weekly map published on Thursdays showing drought conditions. The monitor, established in 1999, is produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The map is based on measurements of climatic, hydrologic and soil conditions as well as reported impacts and observations from more than 350 contributors around the country. The monitor showed that 71.66 percent of Florida was in a moderate to extreme drought as of May 30. (The previous few weeks it had been between 65 and 66.) While that was the highest this year, there have been multiple other weeks that it reached similarly high levels since 2000. The last time the drought monitor showed Florida’s area of drought was as high as 71 percent was February 2013. As bad as this drought is, it’s been even worse. During two weeks in April 2012, 99.96 percent of Florida was in a drought. More than 72 percent of Florida was in a drought between late January and early June 2012. There was also an extended period of drought between December 2010 and July 2011 and between April and August 2007. There were also periods of drought in 2000-01. Florida’s dry season runs from about November through May and can leave Florida prone to drought conditions. If the dry season is drier than usual and the wet season is late to appear, a period of drought can run into summer, said Victor Murphy, climate service program manager for NOAA's National Weather Service-Southern Region. There is a small bit of good news: The return of the rainy season — under way this first week of June — should improve drought conditions. ""There have been at least three other instances in the past 10 years when this has occurred,"" Murphy said. ""Not coincidentally, all of these events began in the winter/spring (dry) season, and ended during the summer. This event will be similar. ""Since the Florida wet season has returned with a vengeance over the past week, and is forecast to continue over the next few weeks, the amount of Florida in drought two to four weeks from now should be substantially less than what it is today."" Gore tied in several weather events to illustrate the effects of climate change. Experts told us that Florida is prone to periodic droughts, but rising temperatures as a result of climate change can make droughts worse. ""It’s part of the climate -- part of natural cycles,"" said David Zierden, the state climatologist for Florida who works at the Florida Climate Center at Florida State University. ""Our current drought is no worse or more prolonged than any other drought we go through periodically."" This year the Florida Peninsula only received half of its normal rainfall during the dry season, leading to the most active wildfire season since 2011. Temperatures have been rising in Florida -- the statewide average temperature for 26 of the last 27 months have all been warmer than normal, Zierden said. ""There is an increasing temperature trend, and warmer temperatures lead to greater evapotranspiration rates, which can exacerbate these periods of drought,"" Zierden said. (Gore’s spokeswoman pointed to an article by the Union of Concerned Scientists that makes a similar point.) While Gore’s numerical statement about the drought is correct, David Nolan, chair of the University of Miami’s Department of Atmospheric Sciences, cautioned against pointing to any particular weather event as proof of climate change. ""I am generally not comfortable with relating any local event, a drought in one place or a flood in another, to global warming,"" Nolan said. ""What matters most is global average temperature, because that drives sea level rise, which eventually will be the biggest problem."" Gore said ""70 percent of Florida is in drought today."" Gore correctly cited the United States Drought Monitor which showed that 71.66 percent of Florida was experiencing a drought for the week ending May 30. However, that drought percentage isn’t unheard of in Florida -- there have been other periods of drought since 2000 when the monitor began mapping drought data",Mostly True,"June 5, 2017"
"""Since the fourth quarter of last year until most recently, we've added almost 50,000 jobs in the coal sector. In the month of May alone, almost 7,000 jobs.""","Just days after President Donald Trump announced that he would be pulling the United States out of the Paris international climate agreement, his Environmental Protection Agency administrator went on the Sunday shows to defend Trump’s decision. During the June 4 interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, host Chuck Todd asked Scott Pruitt whether it was disingenuous for the administration to promise a rebirth of coal. On the one hand, coal is a high-carbon-emissions fuel that is at a disadvantage under the Paris agreement and could potentially benefit from the United States’ exit from the accord. On the other, some experts have said that the demise of coal as an energy source has less to do with emissions than with lost market share to a competing fossil fuel -- natural gas -- and technological improvements that have bolstered renewable energies such as wind and solar. Here’s how Pruitt answered Todd’s suggestion that the administration was making a ""false promise."" ""Dead wrong, because the numbers show exactly the opposite,"" Pruitt said. ""In fact, since the the fourth quarter of last year until most recently, we've added almost 50,000 jobs in the coal sector. In the month of May alone, almost 7,000 jobs."" Is that correct? Calculating job figures for the coal industry is tricky, as we have previously noted, but we found reason to be skeptical of Pruitt’s numbers. The EPA pointed us to a separate interview Pruitt had on ABC’s This Week, when he said, ""We've had over 50,000 jobs since last quarter -- coal jobs, mining jobs -- created in this country. We had almost 7,000 mining and coal jobs created in the month of May alone."" This is also not firmly backed by data. Let’s start with the official Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers. Currently, the BLS counts about 50,000 coal mining jobs in the United States -- total. That makes it all but impossible for the first half of Pruitt’s claim -- 50,000 more mining jobs since the end of last year -- to be accurate. Indeed, according to the BLS data, the actual increase in coal jobs since the end of last year was 1,300, while the monthly increase in May was 400. That’s far below the increases of 50,000 and 7,000 that Pruitt cited, respectively. Based on his comments to ABC, Pruitt appears to have been referring to the broader ""mining and logging"" sector in the BLS data. But even by that standard, his numbers are inflated. The mining and logging sector has grown by 38,000 jobs since the end of last year and grew by 6,000 in May. He’s close when he calls 6,000 ""almost 7,000,"" but 38,000 is well short of 50,000. And if Pruitt meant to refer to these statistics, they include logging jobs as well -- a sector he didn’t reference on the shows. The coal industry has long chafed at the BLS’ definition of coal-sector jobs. Terry Headley, the director of communications for the American Coal Council, said that coal employment numbers compiled independently by states are typically much larger than what BLS has found, perhaps because many states use broader definitions of who should be counted. For instance, Headley said, coal truck drivers -- probably numbering several thousand nationally -- are not broken out from the BLS data for ""truck drivers."" The situation is similar for electricians, surveyors, mechanics, and equipment service technicians, he said. In West Virginia alone, he said, state data for 2015 show 48,327 in the category of miners, mine support, and onsite processing staff. ""If you look purely at the federal numbers you will only get about 12,000 for the state,"" he said. Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, doesn’t dispute that this can have an effect on the numbers. ""It’s possible that the added employment connected with moving the coal once it is removed from the ground, such as transportation and warehousing, and the use of the coal in downstream industries, such as in electric power generation and integrated steel plants, would produce a somewhat bigger employment effect,"" Burtless said. Official BLS data for the coal mining industry ""does omit many workers who work in the industry,"" said Jed Kolko, the chief economist for the jobs site Indeed.com. ""Related industries, like support activities for mining, presumably include some who work in the coal mining industry, though related industries might combine coal with oil and gas and therefore make it hard to come up with a broader total of coal-mining employees."" Still, Burtless said that getting from 1,300 official coal-mining jobs to 50,000 additional jobs that can be credited to the sector would likely require an even more generous definition -- one that estimates how many additional jobs in the overall economy stem from the added purchasing by newly flush coal companies and miners. Headley said that such calculations for the coal sector have historically ranged from a multiplier of three to a multiplier of 11 -- that is, from three times to 11 times as many jobs created in the broader economy for every job created in coal mining. Such a wide range of estimates should serve as a yellow light, economists say, since they are subject to advocates’ rosy estimates. Pruitt is at least able to point to data showing a recent increase in coal production. Data calculated by the federal Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration shows that year-to-date coal production has been 17.6 percent higher than the comparable figure for 2016. And data from the Association of American Railroads shows that, the amount of coal loaded onto rail cars has been significantly higher so far this year than it was during first few months of 2016. Such data indicates that more coal has been mined and shipped in the first part of this year, even if actual job gains aren’t showing up in the data yet. Still, this begs the question of whether this increase had anything to do with the Trump administration’s policies. The increase in coal jobs began before Trump was elected. The job gains in the coal sector during the final five months of the Barack Obama administration -- an administration that Trump’s camp blamed for waging a ""war on coal"" -- were actually slightly larger than the equivalent number for the first five months of the Trump administration, namely 1,400 versus 1,300. Moreover, good and bad times in the coal sector tend to stem more from industry-specific developments and international factors than domestic policy changes, experts said. ""Coal mining is a highly cyclical industry, making it hard to attribute ups and down to policy or political factors,"" Kolko said. A recent report in NPR put its finger on one possible factor that has boosted the coal sector in recent months -- unusually high demand for ""metallurgical"" coal, which is used for making steel, rather than for electricity generation. Metallurgical coal accounts for about about one-sixth of coal production worldwide. Art Sullivan, a mining consultant and former coal miner in Washington, Pa., told NPR that Australia, the world’s leader in metallurgical coal, has faced supply-chain troubles in recent months due to rail and weather problems. This, plus higher Chinese steel production, has caused the price for Australian metallurgical steel to spike, making U.S. firms more competitive recently than they would ordinarily have been, Sullivan told NPR. Pruitt said, ""Since the fourth quarter of last year until most recently, we've added almost 50,000 jobs in the coal sector. In the month of May alone, almost 7,000 jobs."" The official Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows strikingly smaller increases than what Pruitt said, even when taking into account his comments on other Sunday shows. Meanwhile, there is evidence that coal production and shipment is higher this year compared to early 2016, but the rise actually began under Obama and it’s not clear that Trump policies have been the driving factor",Mostly False,"June 5, 2017"
"The federal tax code includes ""deductions for birds flying across America.""","There were a number of head-scratching exchanges in President Donald Trump’s interview with The Economist posted on May 11, including Trump’s claim -- easily debunked -- that he had coined the phrase ""prime the pump."" But one line that raised our eyebrows was about tax deductions for birds. ""I get more deductions,"" Trump said. ""I mean I can tell you this, I get more deductions. They have deductions for birds flying across America. They have deductions for everything."" At first, we were mystified at what Trump was talking about. But as it turns out, he’s on target -- and as a golf course owner, he has reason to know about this obscure part of the federal tax code. We’ll walk you through it. The tax deductions in question involve what are known as ""conservation easements."" A conservation easement for a parcel of land is an agreement by which the landowner pledges to forgo future development. This way, the land remains in its natural state and, among other things, can provide habitat for animals, including migratory birds. In typical easements, the landowner continues to own the land itself, but the right to develop it is donated to a nonprofit organization that promises not to build on it. The difference between the pre-donation value of the land and the post-donation value of the land can be deducted on the landowner’s tax returns as a gift, said Steven Barshov, a land-use and environmental-law attorney at the firm Sive, Paget & Riesel, P.C. The exact loss in land value is determined by an appraiser. For large or expensive parcels of land, the tax break can be substantial -- it can eliminate up to half of the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income (or all of it, if they are a farmer or a rancher). And if the amount of the gift is greater than one year’s adjusted gross income, the balance can be carried over through up to 15 future tax years until the value of the donation is exhausted. Compared to popular tax deductions like those for the interest on home mortgages, deductions for conservation easements are relatively small. Still, they add up: Bloomberg reported that in 2010, almost 3,000 taxpayers used conservation easements to deduct $766 million from their tax returns, according to IRS data. As recently as 2007, that amount was as high as $2.2 billion. Where they have come in for criticism is for disproportionately benefiting the ultra-rich. Indeed, for a time, the administration of President Barack Obama tried to get rid of the tax break. ""They’re overwhelmingly for high-end individuals and provide little to no benefit to the public,"" Dean Zerbe, who examined easement donations as a Republican aide on the Senate Finance Committee, told Bloomberg. ""I don’t know if I could design a tax break that’s more targeted toward the millionaire set."" This may explain why this particular tax deduction popped into Trump’s head during the Economist interview. Forbes noted that when Trump gave the Associated Press a 94-page list of $102 million in charitable donations he had made since 2010, one of the entries was $63.825 million for ""various conservation easements."" The White House did not respond to a request for information about easements, but according to Forbes, Trump has donated easements for land on the Trump National Golf Club in Los Angeles and the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J. Beyond the golf-course easements, Trump has also donated easements for his personal estate in Westchester County, N.Y., as well as his Mar-a-Lago property in Palm Beach, Forbes reported. Easements for golf courses have been particularly controversial, but they have been upheld in the courts, albeit with some restrictions. In one case, the U.S. Tax Court denied a deduction for an easement because the golf course used chemicals that rendered the land unsuitable for wildlife habitat. But in a 2009 case, the Kiva Dunes golf course in Alabama won its case to claim the deduction after demonstrating that it was used by 46 species of neotropical birds that migrate across the Gulf of Mexico. The court’s only quibble was the valuation; the donation’s value was reduced from $30.6 million to $28.7 million. ""Protection of significant wildlife habitat is a conservation purpose qualifying a conservation easement for a charitable deduction,"" David Wooldridge, the Alabama attorney who represented the golf course, told PolitiFact. There’s at least one other provision of the tax code where migratory bird habitat could qualify a landowner for tax deductions. ""In general, farm landowners and tenants can deduct expenses related to soil or water conservation, farmland erosion prevention, or endangered species recovery from their federal taxes, where otherwise these would be considered capital expenses,"" according to a guide for land conservation published by Texas A&M University. To qualify for this deduction requires a nearby endangered species and a conservation plan approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. For the record, neither tax benefit applies only or specifically to birds.   Our ruling Trump said the federal tax code includes ""deductions for birds flying across America."" He’s right -- conservation easements to protect wildlife, including but not limited to migratory birds, can be used as tax deductions.  And Trump should know -- by all indications, he’s saved millions in tax payments on the backs of these little creatures",True,"May 15, 2017"
"""More than 260,000 Americans are employed by the domestic solar industry — three times as many workers as employed by the entire coal mining industry.""","As a candidate and as president, Donald Trump has championed the cause of coal mining. But critics of the coal industry have countered that Trump and other supporters of coal are overlooking an energy sector with an even bigger impact on jobs -- solar energy. In a Chicago Tribune op-ed published on April 20 -- two days before Earth Day -- Rep. Brad Schneider, D-Ill., took issue with Trump’s environmental priorities. At one point in the op-ed, he wrote, ""More than 260,000 Americans are employed by the domestic solar industry — three times as many workers as employed by the entire coal mining industry."" We had previously looked at whether there are more people employed in the U.S. solar-energy industry than in the oil industry. (There aren’t.) But the comparison with the coal industry was new to us, so we decided to take a look. The sources of Schneider’s statistics When we contacted Schneider’s office, they cited two sources, one for each number in the statement. The first number -- 260,000 U.S. solar workers -- stems from the 2016 edition of the National Solar Jobs Census, which is published by the Solar Foundation, a nonprofit organization aligned with the solar industry. We confirmed that, according to the foundation’s calculations, there were 260,077 solar workers in the United States in 2016. The second number -- unstated in the op-ed, but equaling 87,000 workers employed in coal mining, if you do the math -- actually overstates the number of mine workers. According to the Energy Information Administration, a part of the federal Energy Department, the number of people working at coal mines was 65,971 in 2016. The actual ratio between the two numbers would be almost four-to-one. So the congressman has some support for his statement. However, the comparison is not exactly apples-to-apples. Let’s explore why. Comparing data for energy jobs is tricky One problem for Schneider’s numerical comparison is that it uses different databases, with different methodologies. The Solar Foundation told us that their data comes from more than 500,000 telephone calls and more than 60,000 emails to known and potential energy establishments across the United States, resulting in a total of 3,888 full responses. The group counted jobs held by a worker who spends at least 50 percent of his or her time on solar-related work. They included jobs in installation, manufacturing, sales, distribution, and project development, among other categories. The Energy Information Administration data, meanwhile, comes from official U.S. Labor Department data. It includes employees ""engaged in production, preparation, processing, development, maintenance, repair shop, or yard work at mining operations, including office workers."" The coal industry considers the official coal employment numbers to be low ""to the point of being fiction,"" said Terry Headley, a spokesman for the American Coal Council. ""They don't include many people who work at a coal mine every day, full time, but are not company employees,"" Headley said. ""They are employees of service companies that provide direct support services, such as coal truck drivers, electricians, surveyors, machinists, mechanics, construction workers and others. Taken together, despite everything that has been thrown at it, West Virginia alone has some 50,000 ‘coal miners and contractors’ according to the West Virginia Office of Miners Health Safety and Training. If you go by the federal government data, West Virginia has only about 13,000 coal miners working."" A better source While there will always be difficulties in making an exact comparison between the two energy sectors, there is a database well-suited for directly comparing solar and coal jobs. The United States Energy and Employment Report was designed by the Energy Information Association to put a variety of energy sectors on an equal statistical footing. This report found 373,087 solar jobs in 2016, compared to 160,119 coal jobs. (That’s a higher number for solar jobs than in the Solar Foundation report; it’s because the Energy Information Administration included jobs even if a relatively small proportion of the worker’s work week was spent on activities related to solar energy.) Here’s the full summary:  This data produces a ratio of 2.3 solar jobs for every coal job. So by this measurement, there are more solar jobs than coal jobs, but it’s short of three times as high, as Schneider wrote. Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist and an expert in labor-force data, said she agreed that the U.S. Energy and Employment Report data is the best source to use. She added that other data from Indeed, where she is a senior economic fellow, bolsters the idea that the labor market is healthier for solar than for coal. ""We saw almost eight times more solar job postings than coal job postings in the United States in the first quarter of 2017,"" Sinclair said.  ""Of course, these numbers don't represent current employment and are reflective of both growth and turnover in the different sectors. Still, it gives a sense of scale of these industries. This comparison leads me to think that Rep. Schneider's estimates may be on the conservative side looking forward."" Our ruling Schneider said, ""More than 260,000 Americans are employed by the domestic solar industry — three times as many workers as employed by the entire coal mining industry."" Based on an apples-to-apples comparison using the best available data, the ratio is just short of three-to-one. Still, the data we found confirms that the number of solar-related jobs does outpace the number of coal-related jobs today",Mostly True,"April 25, 2017"
"""Trump looking to open up E Coast & new areas for offshore oil drilling when Congress has passed no new safety standards since BP""","On the anniversary of the Deepwater Horizon BP oil spill, Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., attacked President Donald Trump for his stance on drilling and portrayed Congress as doing nothing in the aftermath of the 2010 explosion. ""Trump looking to open up E Coast & new areas for offshore oil drilling when Congress has passed no new safety standards since BP,"" Markey tweeted April 20.   We wanted to know what Trump’s plans were and if Congress has done nothing since the explosion. The April 20, 2010, explosion of BP’s Deepwater Horizon rig was the worst offshore drilling catastrophe in U.S. history. The explosion killed 11 workers, and 134 million gallons of oil were released into the Gulf of Mexico. We emailed a spokesman for Trump and did not get a reply; however, a spokesman for the Bureau of Ocean Management sent information about the reorganization of federal agencies that oversee drilling during the Obama administration. Trump on drilling In 2006, Congress passed a bill to ban oil drilling within 125 miles off much of Florida’s coast and up to 235 miles at some points. The ban is set to expire in 2022. There have been efforts by some Republicans to expand offshore drilling, but so far they have failed. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La, sponsored The American Energy and Conservation Act of 2016 to allow drilling 50 miles off Florida’s Gulf Shores, but the Senate rejected moving ahead on it in November. In response, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., filed a bill to extend the ban by five years, but the Senate hasn’t voted on his bill. During the campaign, Trump generally spoke favorably of expanding oil drilling, although he sounded skeptical about a proposal to allow offshore drilling closer to the Florida beaches in an interview with the Tampa Bay Times, PolitiFact’s parent company, in February 2016. ""They've already got plenty in the Gulf,"" Trump said. ""It would be a little bit of a shame (to expand drilling closer to Florida), because there's so much fracking, and there's so much oil that we have now that we never thought possible. That's an issue I'd absolutely study and do the right thing."" But later in the campaign Trump endorsed more drilling and promised to ""accomplish a complete American energy independence. Complete. Complete."" Trump’s America First Energy Plan called for opening up onshore and offshore leasing on federal lands. A couple months into his administration in March, Trump’s Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke proposed leasing 73 million acres offshore Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida for oil and gas exploration and development starting in August 2017. That was similar to the Obama administration plan. As he was leaving office, President Barack Obama banned drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans for the next five years, but allowed it in the gulf primarily in areas other than Florida. But despite Trump’s rhetoric, the industry hasn’t shown much interest in expanding drilling due to low oil prices, said Athan Manuel, who directs Sierra Club’s Lands Protection Program. ""Ideologically the Trump administration wants to push drilling everywhere, but companies are being cautious right now because the cost so low,"" he said. On March 28, Trump issued an executive order that called for a review of agency actions that ""potentially burden the safe, efficient development of domestic energy resources,"" including oil. Regulations following explosion After BP’s Deepwater Horizon explosion, lawmakers couldn’t agree on safety standard legislation. In 2010, the House approved an overhaul of safety standards, but it never got the approval in the Senate. The Obama administration took some steps to tighten rules in an effort to avoid similar spills, although the rules took several years to develop, and some environmentalists have criticized them as insufficient. In April 2015 -- five years after the explosion -- the administration unveiled a proposed rule to tighten safety standards for blowout preventers, devices that are designed to stop undersea oil wells from exploding. During the Deepwater Horizon explosion, the blowout preventer malfunctioned. The rule was finalized in March 2016. Bob Bea, an expert on risk management and a former Shell executive, told PolitiFact that little has changed in either the regulatory regime or the industrial regime in the United States. He repeatedly said during the Obama administration that the government hadn’t gone far enough in terms of risk assessment. ""Yes, new government 'rules' have been enacted, and new industry 'guidelines' have been issued, but either they have not been implemented or they have not been implemented properly,"" he said. The Government Accountability Office reported in March 2017 that the Interior Department has struggled to successfully implement key initiatives to improve offshore oversight. For example, a risk-based facility inspection initiative was halted due to concerns about its usefulness and unclear protocols. Our ruling Markey tweeted, ""Trump looking to open up E Coast & new areas for offshore oil drilling when Congress has passed no new safety standards since BP."" During the campaign, Trump frequently expressed support to open up more oil drilling. Since in office, his administration proposed leasing 73 million acres offshore starting in August 2017. After the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion, Congress couldn’t agree on safety standards. The Obama administration took some steps to improve safety standards, though some environmentalists say that the government didn’t go far enough",True,"April 21, 2017"
"""I've won awards on environmental protection.""","At a town hall with CEOs, President Donald Trump said his administration will be able to get rid of 90 to 95 percent of regulations ""and still have the same kind of protection."" ""We want safety and we want environmental protection,"" Trump said April 4. ""I've won awards on environmental protection. I'm a big believer, believe it or not. But we want that kind of protection. We want clean air and we want clean water, but we shouldn’t have to get the approvals from 16 different agencies for almost the same thing."" Many readers asked us to look into Trump’s statement about his environmental awards. It’s something he’s said before. At a 2015 campaign rally in Iowa, even as Trump scoffed at environmental regulations -- as in ""a snail, or turtle or snake or something"" that blocked projects -- he said his environmental bona fides were sound. ""I’m a big believer in clean air and clean water,"" he said Dec. 11, 2015. ""I have gotten so many awards for the environment."" While Trump might have talked about ""many awards"" in Iowa, here, we’re simply looking for at least two. The White House pointed to the two it knows about. A New Jersey golf course In 2007, one of Trump’s golf courses got an award. The Metropolitan Golf Association gave its first annual environmental award to the Bedminster New Jersey Trump National Golf Course. How much credit did Trump get? Some. The man who accepted the award on behalf of the golf course, Greg Nicoll, got his moment in the sun, too.   The association’s announcement said Nicoll ""has been an environmental leader among Met Area clubs. Through the leadership of Donald J. Trump, Nicoll has implemented an environmental strategy that has resulted in the preservation of a dedicated 45 acre grassland bird habitat on the property, as well as intensive erosion control and stream stabilization management plan."" So it wasn’t a personal prize for Trump, but the golfing club certainly gave him a thumbs up. Trump did get personal recognition in the second award on the White House’s list. (Hat tip to the Washington Post Fact-checker.) Forest land in New York It seems 2007 was a good year for Trump and the environment. That year, the Friends of Westchester County Parks gave Trump its inaugural Green Space Award for donating over 400 acres to the state park system. The group’s treasurer, Chris Frawley, said, ""It is with heartfelt gratitude that we honor Mr. Trump for his vision and commitment to preservation of open space."" Interestingly, there’s a golf connection here, too, and a backstory of Trump’s experience with environmental permitting. Trump had bought land in Yorktown, about 35 miles north of Manhattan, with plans to turn forest and meadows into a 155-acre golf course. He spent four years trying to win approval, but hit delays due mainly to wetlands on the property and its proximity to a drinking water reservoir. Golf courses use a bevy of chemicals to maintain the turf essential to the game. Jim Tierney, an assistant state attorney general overseeing New York City's watershed, told the New York Times that Trump’s golf course in Yorktown would have been within a mile or so of the New Croton Reservoir, an unfiltered drinking water source for 900,000 city and county residents. ''Once something gets into the drinking water, it doesn't get filtered out,'' Tierney told the newspaper. ''It comes out of the faucet.'' In 2002, Trump pulled the plug on the project. In a letter announcing his decision, as reported by the New York Post, Trump told the Yorktown supervisor, ""You have done a terrible disservice to your constituents who have sadly lost out on a tremendous opportunity."" The town said it was still working to resolve issues with Trump when he withdrew his plans. Trump saw it differently. ''I think the approval process in Westchester is even more difficult than the approval process in Manhattan,'' Trump told the New York Times. ''But in a perverse way, they've done me a favor because the land has gotten more valuable.'' Trump’s letter said he could make more money selling the land to home builders than developing it for golf. Ultimately, after a few years, he decided to donate the land. The state created the Donald J. Trump State Park, and Trump got his award. There’s a coda to that: In 2010, budget cuts led the state to say it would no longer maintain the park lands. Trump said ""If they’re going to close it, I’ll take the land back,"" according to news reports. He didn’t take further action. It's worth noting that these two awards were not from major environmental groups such as the Sierra Club or the Environmental Defense Fund. They were from local groups for specific projects. Our ruling Trump said that he has won awards for environmental protection. The White House pointed to two that include his name. One thanked him personally for donating over 400 acres of undeveloped land to the New York State Park System. The other recognized the environmental stewardship of a Trump golf course in New Jersey operated by a well known manager, and cited Trump’s leadership in general terms. So Trump can firmly claim one personal award and one where his role and the accorded honor are more diffuse. By definition, two is plural, but the personal recognition of Trump is thin for the second one",Half True,"April 6, 2017"
"""The EPA director under Obama said the Clean Power Initiative would have no effect on man-made CO2 emissions. That's what she said. Go look it up.""","During an appearance on Bill Maher’s HBO show, former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., tried to convince the generally liberal host that Donald Trump was right to shelve Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which placed stricter standards on carbon emissions from power plants as a way of curbing pollution and climate change. ""The EPA director under Obama said the Clean Power Initiative would have no effect on man-made CO2 emissions,"" Santorum said. ""That's what she said. Go look it up."" As if Santorum’s suggestion to ""look it up"" wasn’t enough of a prompt for us to take a look, a number of readers also suggested we analyze his statement. So we did. What was the Clean Power Plan? In August 2015, the Obama administration announced that its Clean Power Plan regulations would require power plants to reduce carbon emissions, from 2005 levels, by 32 percent by 2030. Scientists say that carbon emissions are a significant contributor to global climate change. Advocates added that the Clean Power Plan would also reduce other emissions that create soot and smog. However, after opponents sued the Obama administration and found some success in the courts, the plan was never implemented. Then, on March 28, President Donald Trump, as expected, issued an executive order that set in motion the plan’s dismantling. What was Santorum referring to? The primary piece of evidence for Santorum’s statement, according to Santorum spokesman Matt Beynon, was an exchange at a House Science Committee hearing on July 9, 2015, including questioning of Obama EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas. Here’s the exchange: Smith: ""On the Clean Power Plan, former Obama Administration Assistant Secretary, Charles McConnell said it best, that it will reduce global temperature by only 1/100th of a degree Celsius. At the same time, it is going to increase the cost of electricity, that's going to hurt the lowest income Americans the most. How do you justify such an expensive burden, some -- rule that is really not going to do much good, and isn't this all pain and no gain?"" McCarthy: ""No sir. I don't agree with you. If you look at the RIA we did, the Regulatory Impact Analysis, you would see it's enormously beneficial. The value of this…"" Smith: ""Would you consider 1/100th of a degree to be enormously beneficial?"" McCarthy: ""The value of this rule is not measured in that way. It is measured in showing strong domestic action, which can actually trigger global action to address what is a…"" Smith: ""Do you disagree with my 1/100th of a degree figure? Do you disagree with my 1/100th of a degree?"" McCarthy: ""I’m not disagreeing that this action in and of itself will not make all the difference we need to address climate action. But what I'm saying is if (we) don't take action domestically, we will never get started."" Smith: ""But if you're looking at the results, the results can't justify the cost and the burden that you are imposing on the American people."" McCarthy: ""Actually this is a cost-beneficial rule…"" Did McCarthy say the rule would have ""no effect on man-made CO2 emissions""? First, we should point out that neither Smith nor McCarthy mentioned emissions per se in their exchange -- they discussed temperatures, a related but separate factor. Beyond that, though, McCarthy actually didn't say the plan would have ""no effect."" It would be more accurate to say McCarthy sidestepped the question. After McCarthy’s non-response to Smith’s question, the lawmaker didn’t follow up on that specific line of questioning. Because of McCarthy’s verbal fancy footwork, it’s a stretch for Santorum to say McCarthy acknowledged the view that the Clean Power Plan would have ""no effect"" on carbon emissions. In the meantime, Benyon provided some additional pieces of supporting evidence. However, they did not directly support Santorum’s statement. Benyon cited comments by an earlier EPA administrator under Obama, Lisa Jackson, at a hearing of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. At the hearing, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., showed Jackson a chart showing ""virtually no change"" in carbon dioxide and asked her if she agreed with it. Jackson responded, ""I believe that essential parts of the chart are that the U.S. acting alone will not impact the world's CO2 levels. But as we've all said, and as many members of this committee said, the race is on for us to enter into a clean energy future. There is technology in this country that can be used to move markets not only here, but abroad, and that means jobs for Americans that we are currently losing."" This is actually a stronger example of an Obama EPA administrator acknowledging the limitations of curbing carbon emissions. However, this hearing was held in 2009, long before the Clean Power Plan was unveiled. (In fact, in 2009, the Obama administration was pursuing legislation, not regulation, on carbon emissions.) Benyon also cited prepared testimony in 2016 by former Obama assistant energy secretary for fossil fuels Charles McConnell. ""What is also clear both scientifically and technically is that the EPA’s (Clean Power Plan) is not a plan that will significantly impact global CO2 emissions."" McConnell wrote. He cited calculations that the Clean Power Plan would reduce global temperatures by 0.01 degrees Fahrenheit and that the reduction in sea level rise would be only as wide as two human hairs. ""These are facts, and facts are stubborn things,"" he said. But again, Santorum wasn’t citing just any senior Obama administration official but specifically the head of the EPA. Does Santorum have a point anyway? Some researchers have expressed skepticism about the Clean Power Plan’s value. Benjamin Zycher of the conservative American Enterprise Institute and Patrick Michaels and Paul Knappenberger of the libertarian Cato Institute, have pointed to calculations using a model known as MAGICC, which EPA itself has used. The model suggests that the Clean Power Plan would reduce temperatures by small fractions of a degree, varying by the assumptions made. A wide range of climate scientists and policy experts we checked with offered some counterpoints. First, they said the United States needs to take its own steps to curb carbon production if the rest of the world is going to follow. ""Everyone acknowledges that the Clean Power Plan alone isn't enough to stop climate change, but that's a rather ridiculous bar to hold for a single regulation,"" said William Anderegg, a biologist at the University of Utah. ""What is clear, however, is that the Clean Power Plan is likely the single most critical piece of U.S. action to fulfill our commitments under the Paris Agreement."" Second, they argued that even a small reduction would be preferable to the upward trend line the world would likely see otherwise. ""Reducing the temperature of the atmosphere by 1/100th of a degree is in fact really significant,"" said Harold Wanless, who chairs the department of geological sciences at the University of Miami. ""We shot up several hundredths of a degree last year alone. Every hundredth of a degree cooled is a step in the right direction."" Finally, Santorum's perspective ""misses the thousands of lives per year we're already saving each year by cutting coal use,"" said Rob Jackson, a professor at the Stanford University School of Earth, Energy and Environmental Sciences. And tallying up the impact of just the Clean Power Plan ignores other carbon-reduction policies pursued by the Obama administration, including higher vehicle fuel economy standards, regulations on other greenhouse gases such as methane, and heightened energy-efficiency requirements for buildings and appliances. Reasonable people can disagree about whether the costs on utilities, their employees and local economies justify such benefits. But focusing only on the global warming impact of the Clean Power Plan, as Santorum did, ignores these other considerations. Our ruling Santorum said, ""The EPA director under Obama said the Clean Power Initiative would have no effect on man-made CO2 emissions. That's what she said. Go look it up."" Many scientists would acknowledge that the climate-change impact of U.S. action by itself would be modest. However, McCarthy didn’t actually say that, and few experts would peg the impact at zero, as Santorum did",False,"April 6, 2017"
"""There’s not one public study, and by public study I mean a study available to the public, that has looked at using the product Kaput to poison feral hogs.""","A Texas meat processor who questions a government-approved bait that kills feral hogs charges there’s no public research on the product. Will Herring, owner of the Hubbard-based Wild Boar Meat Company, which makes hog meat into pet food, has said he fears the product’s active ingredient--warfarin, long known as a rat poison and human blood thinner--will damage his business. Also, Herring said: ""There’s not one public study, and by public study I mean a study available to the public, that has looked at using the product Kaput to poison feral hogs,"" a comment we spotted in a March 6, 2017, news story in the San Antonio Express-News. A note: Public studies of particular pesticides don’t appear to be mandatory. An Environmental Protection Agency web page about registering pesticides says only that the ""company that wants to produce the pesticide must provide data from studies  that comply with our testing guidelines"" without mention of whether the studies must be public or, say, conducted independently. That web page also says that before registering a product, EPA develops risk assessments evaluating the potential harms to humans, wildlife, fish, and plants, including endangered species and non-target organisms plus any possible contamination of surface water or groundwater from leaching, runoff and ""spray drift."" Still, Herring persuaded a state district judge to issue a temporary order putting a hold on state rules approving Kaput’s use by state-licensed pesticide applicators and state Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, filed a proposal barring the state from registering any lethal pesticide, including warfarin, for feral hog control unless a state agency or university performs and publishes a scientific study weighing the pesticide’s environmental and economic effects. Both moves happened after Sid Miller, the Republican state agriculture commissioner, announced the Texas Department of Agriculture would issue rules limiting Kaput’s sale and use to licensed individuals. When we inquired, the state agency emailed us a spreadsheet indicating that Colorado-based Scimetrics, the company poised to vend Kaput, fielded $136,854 in research grants from TDA from 2013 into 2017. All told in 2016-17, the sheet indicates, the agency awarded $802,500 to fight feral hogs; that counts funds awarded to counties, universities and other agencies. Feral hogs can be fearsome nuisances. Nationally, as many as 750,000 are harvested annually, yet how they ravage rural and suburban lands remains a problem--and Texas is home to more than 2 million of them. No public study? We asked Herring how he reached his conclusion about no public studies. By phone, he told us that he didn’t find specific studies of the product in online searches nor, he said, did Genesis Laboratories, the Colorado-based company that developed the product, provide a study at his firm's inquiry. We also reached Richard Poché, Genesis Labs' president, who conceded that no Kaput study has been formally published. He said, though, the company completed a study in Texas in 2015 submitted under the title ""Field efficacy of a warfarin bait used to control feral hog populations"" for consideration by the Wiley-published Wildlife Society Bulletin, which describes itself as a journal for wildlife practitioners that effectively integrates cutting-edge science with management and conservation, and also covers important policy issues, particularly those that focus on the integration of science and policy. By email, the bulletin’s editor, Kansas State University’s David Haukos, confirmed that study was submitted. In March 2017, Haukos told us: ""The manuscript is currently undergoing peer-review; therefore, no decision has been made concerning publication."" Poché said by phone the 2015 study was followed up by another in 2016 with a third study underway in 2017, each one based on feeding the Kaput product to feral hogs. Both of the first two studies, he said, decimated exposed hog populations in North Texas study areas; he noted too the bait uses only one-fifth of the warfarin found in conventional rat and mouse baits. We asked for a copy of the 2015 study. By email, Poché said that remains ""confidential business information,"" and that releasing it before publication would leave his company with no control of where it ends up. Poché otherwise provided two of his own March 2017 PowerPoint presentations on Kaput along with the printed program for the April 2016 International Wild Pig Conference program in Myrtle Beach, S.C. A section of the program, ""Feral hog control using a new bait,"" evidently describes a Scimetric study. It opens: ""An EPA Experimental Use Permit was obtained to conduct a field trial using a novel bait to control feral hogs. The product, 12-years under development, was used to determine the efficacy against feral hogs on test sites 50 miles east of Plainview, Texas. Two paraffin bait formulations were tested, containing 0.005% and 0.01% warfarin. Hog activity was monitored pre- and post-treatment using trail cameras near feeders, VHF and GPS transmitting equipment, and bait consumption."" Next, the summary says: ""Bait was applied in modified commercial feeders with heavy lids. Baiting initiated on June 1 and terminated June 30, 2015. After the 30-day exposure period efficacy on the 5-km treatment plot baited with 0.005% warfarin was 100%, 98.6%, and 97.8% using radio-tracking, trail camera images, and bait consumption. Efficacy on the 0.01% warfarin bait plot was not as effective. Ninety-seven non-target searches were conducted during the treatment and post-treatment phases to examine for mortality, for which none were found,"" an indication other animals weren’t killed by the bait. The text closes: ""The low warfarin concentrate bait proved effective in eliminating wild hogs while posing minimal exposure to non-target wildlife."" The longer of the PowerPoint presentations includes a slide stating that warfarin was approved as a rodent-killer in 1948 and as a human drug six years later. The presentation also has several slides titled: ""Field Efficacy of a Feral Hog Bait Containing 0.005% Warfarin,"" with a subtitle indicating the slides refer to research in North Texas from 2015 into 2017. Images include feral hogs wearing GPS collars or tagged for tracking by radio. One slide summarizes the research results by different methods of making hog counts:                  SOURCE: Presentation, ""Where we’ve been and where we’re going with Warfarin for controlling wild pigs,"" March 1, 2017, Richard Poché, Genesis Labs (received by email from Poché, March 9, 2017) Company: No independent research ‘necessary’ Poché, asked if independent research makes sense before Kaput goes commercial, emailed: ""Not necessary. We do research under what is called Good Laboratory Practices, which is required by the EPA. No one can match the quality and integrity of the work."" According to an EPA web page, the agency conducts audits to ensure companies developing pesticide products comply with those practices. EPA registration Our search of EPA’s web site led us to a Jan. 3, 2017, agency document indicating that on Jan. 3, 2017, Kaput Feral Hog Bait was registered with the agency under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. ""Registration is in no way to be construed as an endorsement or recommendation of this product by the Agency,"" the document further states. ""In order to protect health and the environment, the Administrator, on his motion, may at any time suspend or cancel the registration of a pesticide in accordance with the Act."" Also, the document says, the product is ""conditionally registered"" in accord with section 3(c)(7)(a) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act; the section says the EPA administrator may conditionally register a pesticide if the pesticide is ""identical or substantially similar"" to a registered pesticide and approving the registration wouldn’t ""significantly increase the risk of any unreasonable adverse effect on the environment."" Another agency web page says: ""If EPA finds that the pesticide meets the standard for registration, but there are outstanding data requirements, the Agency may, under certain circumstances, grant a ‘conditional’ registration pursuant to FIFRA section 3(c)(7). However, before granting a conditional registration, EPA must determine that, although an application lacks some of the required data, use of the pesticide would not significantly increase the risk of unreasonable adverse effects on people or the environment during the time needed to generate the necessary data."" We asked Poché about ""outstanding data requirements"" with Kaput, as mentioned generally by the EPA. By email, Poché said a ""1-year storage stability study"" for Kaput has been submitted to the EPA. Poché unpacked: ""An EPA-registered pesticide requires stability of the chemical in the formula available to the public. The product is stored in the marketing container on the shelf at room temperature over a one-year period. The bait is analyzed every 3 months for the warfarin concentration. That analysis is done at the beginning and at 3, 5, 9, and 12 months after manufacturing. The goal is to ensure the bait is good after 1 year and the concentration of warfarin is plus or minus 10% of what the EPA label requires. In our case the concentrations were within 1% of the label requirements,"" Poché said. Over a couple days, we did not draw an EPA response to Herring’s claim. Otherwise the National Pesticide Information Center, which partners Oregon State University with the EPA, responded to our inquiry by pointing out a 1991 EPA ""fact sheet"" on warfarin that states the EPA evaluates pesticides by obtaining from producers a ""complete set of studies showing the human health and environmental effects of each pesticide. The Agency imposes any regulatory controls that are needed to effectively manage each pesticide's risks,"" the sheet says. State intends limits Miller, the state agriculture commissioner, is a former legislator who authored the Texas law enabling hunters to shoot at feral hogs from helicopters. At the TDA, spokeswoman Jennifer Dorsett responded to our inquiry about the absence of public studies of Kaput. Dorsett said by email: ""Kaput is an entirely proprietary product, so studies on the Kaput Feral Hog Bait are owned by the company and you would have to contact them directly to see if they will release them to you."" Also by email, TDA spokesman Mark Loeffler stressed that while the state agency helped fund Kaput research, its role is generally limited to cataloging pesticides approved by EPA, including Kaput, though Miller applied his authority to make Kaput ""state limited use,"" to be sold by licensed dealers and used by licensed applicators, Loeffler said. ""We do not do state-paid studies of proposed pesticides,"" Loeffler wrote. ""We are not required to do lengthy study of a product because we have little discretion to reject or deny"" registrations, he said. Dorsett otherwise provided a document listing a dozen reports on poisoning feral hogs, issued from 1987 through 2002, including seven titles specifying ""warfarin,"" we tallied. Dorsett said the agency’s toxicologist, Michael Hare, used the reports as references in evaluating Kaput as a state-limited-use pesticide. Dorsett told us relevant research also has involved the Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service, which says it has officials in nearly every county demonstrating ""the latest technology and best practices to improve the state’s food and fiber system."" We didn't hear back from the service. Loeffler added that Miller has personally drawn on a 1995 post about warfarin’s history as a rat poison and its toxicity to animals put out by universities teamed in the Extension Toxicology Network. Excerpt: ""Warfarin is only slightly dangerous to humans and domestic animals when used as directed, but care must be taken with young pigs, which are especially susceptible."" Also, the post says, warfarin--which is insoluble in water--poses no threat to aquatic organisms and is ""practically non-toxic"" to game birds, with chickens ""relatively resistant."" Our ruling Herring said there’s no public study of Kaput, the product that might soon be available in Texas to attack feral hogs. There’s no public study of that EPA-registered product, we confirmed. But a 2015 study submitted to a science journal would become public if it’s accepted for publication. Also, the effects on feral hogs of warfarin, Kaput’s active ingredient, has been explored in published studies",Mostly True,"March 16, 2017"
"""It's important to pay attention to the Russian spy drama, but let's not ignore the fact that the following (10) bills have been introduced"" in the House.","If you inhabit the more liberal corners of social media, you may have seen a list of 10 Republican bills in your feed -- a reminder of the substantive changes that could result from unified GOP control of Washington. Here’s the text of a common version that’s circulating: OK - It's important to pay attention to the Russian spy drama, but let's not ignore the fact that the following bills HAVE been introduced: 1.

Call your House Representative and ask them to not only vote ""NO""...but to speak up for our rights, health & safety, and our beautiful country. How accurate is the post? All 10 bills cited do exist, and most (though not all) have been accurately described. But a majority of the bills mentioned haven’t advanced very far or attracted more than a few co-sponsors, so many are relative longshots for actually becoming law. How accurate are the descriptions? Most of the bills listed are described by their official title, or by a truncated version of the official title. So those strike us as being accurate. But for a few bills, the description is overly broad or misleading. One of those -- H.J.R. 69 -- is described as ""Repeal Rule Protecting Wildlife."" That’s on the right track, but whoever reads this wouldn’t know that it’s specific to certain types of federal land in Alaska. The measure is an effort to overturn a federal rule using the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to repeal executive branch regulations under certain circumstances. The measure in question would overrule an Obama administration rule governing non-subsistence taking of wildlife on National Wildlife Refuge land in Alaska. As it happens, this is the only one of the 10 measures that has passed the House already. It passed by a mostly party-line, 225-193 margin on Feb. 16, 2017. It is now awaiting action in the Senate. Another bill with a somewhat exaggerated description is H.R. 785, which is listed as ""National Right to Work (this one ends unions)."" Right-to-work laws say workers can’t be forced to join a union. They do this by making it harder to form a union, and it’s true that on average, states that have right-to-work laws have significantly lower unionization rates than states that don’t. But it’s an exaggeration to say that it ""ends"" unions. In fact six of the states that have right to work laws have between 10 and 16 percent of their workforces unionized -- Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Nevada, and West Virginia. And the remainder of right-to-work states do have unions -- they’re just less common than in the states that don’t have a right-to-work law. The third and last of the exaggerated descriptions refers to H.R. 147, which is listed as ""Criminalizing Abortion (‘Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act’)."" This bill would criminalize one particular kind of abortion -- one sought ""based on the sex, gender, color or race of the child, or the race of a parent."" That’s not to say it’s not controversial -- it is. Referring to last year’s version of the bill, then-Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., called the measure ""an affront to all minority women, especially Latinas and immigrant women, who already face disproportionate barriers to access health care and health education."" But contrary to the most obvious reading of the social media post, this bill would not criminalize abortion across the board. How much support do these bills have? A few are likely to go far. For the rest, probably not. Let’s start with the bills where eventual passage seems quite plausible. As we noted, the Alaska wildlife measure has already passed the House and must now be taken up by the Senate. Two other bills listed are unlikely to move in the version listed, but the ideas contained within them are likely to be taken up by the GOP leadership on a high-priority basis. One is H.R. 370, which would repeal the Affordable Care Act. H.R. 370 itself doesn’t have a single co-sponsor, but repealing Obama’s health care law is a high priority for House Republicans. An actual repeal-and-replace bill was released on March 6, and that is the likelier vehicle to be considered by the chamber. The other measure that’s likely to advance, but not in the version listed in the post, is H.R. 354, which would stop federal funding for abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood. Federal funding for abortions is already banned, but opponents of abortion say that federal funding should be stopped for non-abortion services provided by clinics that offer abortions. The draft of the Obamacare repeal bill unveiled on March 6 would stop funding for such organizations. Of the other seven bills, none has advanced beyond introduction, and all but one have a minimal number of co-sponsors, all of them Republicans. Here’s the rundown, as of March 7, 2017: • H.R. 861 -- ""Terminate the Environmental Protection Agency"" -- one sponsor, three co-sponsors. • H.R. 610 -- ""Vouchers for Public Education"" -- one sponsor, three co-sponsors. • H.R. 899 -- ""Terminate the Department of Education"" -- one sponsor, eight co-sponsors. • H.R. 785 -- ""National Right to Work (this one ends unions) -- one sponsor, 15 co-sponsors. • H.R. 83 -- ""Mobilizing Against Sanctuary Cities Bill"" -- one sponsor, nine co-sponsors. • H.R. 147 -- ""Criminalizing Abortion (‘Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act’)"" -- one sponsor, 59 co-sponsors. • H.R. 808 -- ""Sanctions against Iran"" -- one sponsor, four co-sponsors. So just one of these bills have attracted co-sponsorship of more than 15 out of the 435 House members. The one that did, on prenatal sex selection, has been introduced for several congresses running and has only moved beyond introduction once. That was in 2012, when the House leadership put it up under so-called suspension of the rules. That means that a bill is fast-tracked to a vote, but to pass, it needs to win two-thirds support. The bill failed to meet the two-thirds threshold; on a mostly party-line vote, it secured 246 votes in favor and 168 votes against. For the rest, it’s conceivable that these can pass, especially in an environment -- as we have now -- with unified Republican control. Many of these bills address issues that President Donald Trump has advocated. That said, the House has only a limited amount of time, and co-sponsorship and committee consideration are key indications of what ranks high on the leadership’s agenda. On these metrics, the remaining seven bills fall short of being considered top-tier priorities. Rather, these bills may have more of an impact in keeping the GOP base happy. John Feehery, a former aide to then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert, said most of the bills on the list seem ""like click-bait for fundraising to me. I find it it hard (to believe) that they go anywhere."" Feehery is now president of the bipartisan lobbying firm Quinn Gillespie Associates. Our ruling The social media post listed 10 bills that it said have been introduced in the House by Republicans. All 10 bills in the post have in fact been introduced. Seven were described accurately, while three had somewhat exaggerated descriptions. Meanwhile, one of the 10 bills has passed, and two seem to be on a fast track, while the other seven are more accurately considered longshots. So the post is largely correct, but it includes some exaggerated language, and it fails to distinguish between top-tier agenda items and priorities further back in the pack",Mostly True,"March 7, 2017"
"""We've repealed regulations for the first time in 20 years using the Congressional Review Act -- three regulations that were going to cost the economy hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs.""","With a powerful Republican ally in the White House, Sen. Rand Paul said Congress is moving fast to reduce the burden of government regulations. On ABC’s This Week on Feb. 19, Paul, R-Ky., held up the deregulatory action taken by Congress as an example of the administration’s earliest weeks not being as chaotic as they may have seemed. ""We repealed regulations for the first time in 20 years using the Congressional Review Act,"" Paul added. ""Three regulations that were going to cost the economy hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs."" We decided to review Paul’s claim about whether the moves saved money and jobs. His statement hinges on analyses by the government and industry advocates, but they also occasionally contradict his point. The rules Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress can disapprove a rule by a simple majority vote, and then the president must sign off. Trump signed one disapproval on Feb. 14, which rejected a provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulation law. The rule required publicly traded mining, oil and gas companies to disclose their payments to governments. Another, signed Feb. 16, nullified the Stream Protection Rule, a rule created by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (within the Department of the Interior) to limit coal mining companies from releasing waste into waterways. Opponents of the rule said that it would reduce jobs in an already-contracting industry. Proponents said it would help keep ecosystems free of the toxic waste. The third disapproval, which Trump signed on Feb. 28 after Paul’s interview, concerned some provisions of the 2007 National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Intended to stop the mentally ill from obtaining guns, the rule required the Social Security Administration to share information about beneficiaries who do not manage their own benefits to the national background check system. Expected financial toll Paul’s claim that these regulations could cost ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" is reasonable, said Brian Mannix, a research professor at the George Washington University Regulatory Studies Center. He said many federal rules can cost much more than that, though it is difficult to say without a detailed analysis. We found some reports on the effects of the financial and environmental regulations. We did not, however, find a government report assessing costs or job impact for the rule on guns. The SEC estimated that 425 companies might be affected by the new financial disclosure regulation, with average total assets of $6.4 billion. The SEC also set compliance costs for the companies at $54.7 million to upwards of $700 million (the variation is due to variations in fixed costs), though they acknowledged ""significant limitations"" on their analysis that might have made it much lower.    As for the cost of the Stream Protection Rule, the report prepared for the Office of Surface Mining and Enforcement’s estimated total U.S. compliance costs at $81.5 million (or 0.3 percent of estimated total annual revenue for the coal industry). That figure includes $63.6 million for operational costs, which includes commercial transport and reforestation. The government’s potential tax revenue loss to states was $995,000. Paul’s spokesman Sergio Gor sent us a study by Ranboll Environ that was prepared for the National Mining Association, a private group with public opposition to the rule. The study estimates the potential annual value of coal lost to production restriction is between $14 billion and $29 billion, with between $3.1 billion to $6.4 billion lost in state and federal tax revenue. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement declined to comment on the record. Expected jobs impact The question of whether these regulations would save ""tens of thousands"" of jobs is more complex. On the disclosure rule, the SEC report did not comment on potential job increases or losses. And again, there is no estimate for jobs lost as a result of reduced reporting to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. As for the Stream Protection Rule, an impact analysis prepared for the Office of Surface Mining in November 2016 said the rule ""would reduce employment by 124 jobs on average each year due to decreased coal mining,"" though the regulation might add 280 jobs in compliance efforts. The Ramboll Environ report stated that the Stream Protection Rule threatened 113,000 to 280,000 American mining jobs based on what it said was an independent analysis performed at 36 mines across the country. An expert said the government’s estimates are ""much more reasonable"" than the one completed for the mining association. ""My take based on the available research is that the impact of the rule would be minimal,"" said Robert Godby, the director of the University of Wyoming Center for Energy Economics and Public Policy, said about the Stream Protection Rule. He said he thought that the NMA study conflated the potential effects of the Stream Protection Rule with other regulations enacted in 2009, and that the study didn’t account for other market factors that have caused larger downward trends in coal production. Our ruling Paul said that repealing three rules will save ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" and ""tens of thousands of jobs."" Studies of the regulations partially back up Paul’s claim, particularly in terms of financial burden. The evidence is less strong for his point about ""tens of thousands"" of jobs lost. The only information we could find for a regulation with a job-killing aspect is the stream protection rule. The government’s estimate said the rule could result in 124 lost mining positions a year (though compliance could result in the creation of more than twice as many). An industry-backed study offered a much more dramatic outlook for lost coal jobs, but one expert questioned its methodology",Half True,"March 2, 2017"
"""I would imagine that there's probably a gun in the school (in Wapiti, Wyo.) to protect from potential grizzlies.""","President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for education secretary thinks some K-12 schools may decide they need a gun on campus — to protect themselves from bear attacks, for example. At her Senate confirmation hearing, education activist and major Republican donor Betsy DeVos mentioned a meeting she had with Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo. He told her about a rural public school in Wapiti, Wyo., that has a fence surrounding the schoolyard to keep grizzly bears out. Later in the hearing, DeVos suggested a fence might not be enough. When Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., asked DeVos if she thinks guns should be allowed on school premises, DeVos said that decision should be left up to local lawmakers who might have specific needs. Like grizzly bears.  ""I would imagine that there's probably a gun in the school to protect from potential grizzlies,"" she said, referencing the school in Wyoming. We couldn’t bear not knowing whether the elementary school in Wapiti, Wyo., keeps a gun on hand to defend against grizzlies. So we called up Park County School District No. 6, which includes Wapiti Elementary School. ""No, we do not,"" said Angie Page, assistant to the superintendent, citing the district’s no-weapons policy. The entire state of Wyoming actually has a policy banning weapons on elementary, middle and high school campuses, state Department of Education spokesperson Kari Eakins said. Decisions about wildlife defensive measures are made at the local level and not reported to the state. Even though Wapiti Elementary doesn’t keep a gun for use against a grizzly, there really is a fence to keep bears out.   Wapiti, an unincorporated community with a population of about 165, is located on the edge of Yellowstone National Park. More than 700 grizzlies live in the Greater Yellowstone area, according to the National Park Service. The Wapiti school put up a fence to keep the grizzlies out of the playground in 2002, according to the Billings Gazette, a newspaper in Montana. Between 1990 and 2000, 16 grizzly bears were captured within a 4-mile radius of Wapiti, the article said. The Denver Post reported in 2005 that a Wyoming Fish and Game biologist had recently captured two cubs hanging around the Wapiti school, and that a grizzly hide was nailed outside of the principal’s office. Even after finding that DeVos’ claim was incorrect, we wondered if it’s advisable to use a gun when faced with a potential grizzly bear attack. Adult males can weigh up to 700 pounds and are about 3.5 feet tall at the shoulder.   ""Without question, guns can protect people from bears,"" said Tom Smith, a wildlife sciences professor at Brigham Young University. ""But, and this is a big but, to be able to use a firearm under duress effectively is limited to a very small group of persons."" Smith told us that people would be much better off using some sort of bear spray (about $40 on Amazon). It’s non-lethal to the bear, it’s less cumbersome than a gun, and because it creates a plume of spray, the user’s aim doesn’t have to be as accurate as it would be if he or she were using a gun. A study of bear attacks in Alaska found that in 27 percent of cases involving guns that failed, the person couldn’t get their gun ready fast enough to shoot the bear, according to an article Smith wrote for Alaska Magazine in 2012. Firing a warning shot was only successful at getting the bear to leave in 33 percent of incidents. ""So while some may carry firearms for protection, and it certainly is their right, the vast majority of persons would do themselves — and bears and quite honestly the rest of us — a big favor by carrying bear spray,"" Smith said. Our ruling DeVos said, ""I would imagine that there's probably a gun in the school (in Wapiti, Wyo.) to protect from potential grizzlies."" The elementary school in Wapiti certainly faces the threat of grizzly bears, given its proximity to Yellowstone National Park. It has a fence surrounding the playground to keep bears out. However, the state of Wyoming and the school district ban weapons in K-12 schools, so Wapiti Elementary does not have a gun on hand to defend against potential bear attacks",False,"January 18, 2017"
"Says Rex Tillerson ""sued to keep a fracking project out of his backyard.""","Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of state, doesn’t have a problem with fracking until it affects him, says a consumer rights group. ""ExxonMobil is a major player in the fracking industry, and #ExxonKnew climate change was a problem for decades, but covered up the evidence,"" reads a campaign letter from Food & Water Watch. ""Tillerson infamously sued to keep a fracking project out of his backyard, but seems happy to profit off fracking in other people's backyards."" For this fact-check, we wanted to know if the head of the largest natural gas-producing company in the United States really said no fracking way to a drilling project in his own neighborhood. Food & Water Watch is right about Tillerson’s participation in the natural gas litigation, though its account misses a few details. Fracking-caused noise and traffic was one of many concerns listed in the lawsuit. Tillerson’s lawyer also told the Wall Street Journal that Tillerson himself cared the most about property devaluation. And the oil chief dropped out of the lawsuit after receiving attention for it. In 2012, Tillerson, his wife and their neighbors in Bartonville, Texas, sued to block the construction of a 160-foot water tower in their luxury community. The tower would, in part, supply water for hydraulic fracturing — which injects pressurized water as well as sand and chemicals under shale rock formations to extract natural gas.    The lawsuit contended the project violates the town’s zoning ordinance and will also be an ""unbearable nuisance."" ""A water tower will have lights on at all hours of the night, traffic to and from the tower at unknown and unreasonable hours, noise from mechanical and electrical equipment needed to maintain and operate the water tower, and creates and (sic) unsafe and unattractive nuisance to the children of the area,"" the suit reads. ""Furthermore, upon information and belief, (the Bartonville Water Supply Corporation) will sell water to oil and gas explorers for fracing shale formations leading to traffic with heavy trucks on FM 407, creating a noise nuisance and traffic hazards,"" it continues. In addition to joining the lawsuit, Tillerson sat for a three-hour deposition in May 2013 and protested the project at a town council meeting that November, according to the Journal’s report in February 2014. But the newspaper noted that Tillerson wasn’t ""the most vocal or well-known opponent of the tower."" That distinction belonged to the lead plaintiffs, former U.S. House Majority Leader Dick Armey and his wife. Environmentalists jumped on the story, with plenty pointing out the irony and hypocrisy but embracing Tillerson into their ranks. A former oil executive penned an open letter to Tillerson on NoFrackingWay.Us decrying the environmental impacts of the practice and wishing him ""good luck with that fracking water tank."" Credo Action, an online hub of progressive activists, dubbed Tillerson ""the highest-profile anti-fracking activist in the world."" And MoveOn.org offered Tillerson its ""FrackingFighter"" award. Under pressure and after a judge dismissed the claims, Tillerson dropped out of the lawsuit two months later in April 2014, the Dallas Business Journal reported. The Armeys and a few others continued to pursue legal action over the project, and the battle continued into at least November 2015, the last mention of the case we could find. Our ruling Food & Water Watch said Tillerson ""sued to keep a fracking project out of his backyard."" Tillerson joined a lawsuit that listed noise nuisance and traffic hazards among the plaintiffs’ many concerns, though he later dropped out of the litigation",Mostly True,"December 14, 2016"
"Says that when San Francisco banned plastic grocery bags, ""you saw the number of instances of people going to the ER with things like salmonella and other related illnesses"" spike.","Reused grocery bags made Californians sick, a conservative Texas analyst suggested. James Quintero, director of the Center for Local Governance at the Austin-based Texas Public Policy Foundation, brought up health implications of shoppers reusing bags during an Oct. 10, 2016, SXSW Eco panel discussion. ""There are health consequences in that,"" Quintero said. ""I believe this is in San Francisco: When they enacted their bag ban, you saw the number of instances of people going to the ER with things like salmonella and other related illnesses—you saw that number spike."" Someone on the panel responded: ""Wait, that’s curious. I never heard that before."" Quintero replied: ""So you have a reusable bag, right? And then of course, people don’t clean out these bags. So when you mix meat with vegetables and fruits and other goods, and you don’t clean out that bag on a regular basis, then people are susceptible to foodborne illnesses."" Take note: Health authorities recommend you wash bags regularly used to carry meats and vegetables. For this fact check, we were curious about what happened when San Francisco banned plastic bags. Quintero cites professors’ paper We asked a foundation spokeswoman, Caroline Espinosa, to share the basis of Quintero’s claim. By email, Espinosa pointed us to a November 2012 paper, ""Grocery Bag Bans and Foodborne Illness,"" by Jonathan Klick and Joshua Wright, law professors at the University of Pennsylvania and George Mason University, respectively. In their write-up, posted by a University of Pennsylvania research center, the authors noted that San Francisco County barred large supermarkets and pharmacies from using ""non-compostable plastic checkout bags,"" effective Oct. 20, 2007. In 2012, the county’s board of supervisors ""expanded the non-compostable plastic checkout bag ban to cover all retail and food establishments in"" the county, effective Oct. 1, 2012, the paper says, also requiring stores to charge at least a dime for any bag provided. ""To analyze emergency room visits,"" the authors wrote, ""we used the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development’s Emergency Department and Ambulatory Surgery Data for each quarter from 2005-2010. These data provide the county of residence of each person admitted to a California ER, as well as the principal diagnosis for the individual using ICD-9 codes. Given the prevalence of coliform bacteria, especially E. coli, in reusable grocery bags, we focus on ER visits involving E. coli,"" the two said. And? The San Francisco bag ban is ""associated with a statistically significant and particularly large increase in ER visits for E. Coli infections. We find increases between one fourth and two thirds, suggesting an increase in visits between 72 and 191 annually,"" the paper said. All told, the authors said, the bag ban there is ""associated with a 46 percent increase in deaths from foodborne illnesses. This implies an increase of 5.5 annual deaths for the county."" On the other hand, the study’s small sample size make ""any inferential claims"" tentative, the authors wrote. We emailed and telephoned each professor and didn’t hear back. San Francisco County memo Hunting perspective, we then ran the authors’ names through the Nexis news database. That query led us to a March 2013 story posted by Texas-based D Magazine stating a San Francisco health officer had spelled out flaws in the professors’ paper. That story included a web link to a Feb. 8, 2013, memo from a San Francisco County health officer, Tomás Aragon, to Eileen Shields, a county public health information officer. The memo said the county Department of Public Health had reviewed the professors’ paper which, the officer noted, ""has not been submitted for rigorous scientific peer review and publication."" Generally, the memo states, ""Klick & Wright’s conclusion that San Francisco’s policy of banning of plastic bags has caused a significant increase in gastrointestinal bacterial infections and a ‘46 percent increase in the deaths from foodborne illnesses’ is not warranted."" One weakness, the memo says, was that the professors presumed a link between reusable bags and a seeming spike in gastrointestinal bacterial infections--yet they failed to establish the link. ""Drawing causal conclusions from this type of study is called an ‘ecological fallacy,’"" the memo states. ""The basic study flaw is that persons that use reusable bags frequently may not be the same persons that were diagnosed with gastrointestinal bacterial infections in their study. This is the reason epidemiologists will not use ecological studies to test causal hypotheses. At best, ecologic studies raise epidemiologic causal hypotheses but cannot test them."" The memo continues: ""In testing causal hypotheses, it is necessary to measure the outcome (gastrointestinal infections) and exposure to the putative cause (reusable bags) in the same persons. Because of their study design, this was not possible."" Also, the memo says that in ""testing causal hypotheses, it is necessary to ‘control for’ alternative causal explanations (called ‘confounders’). Because of their study design, this was not possible. For example, gastrointestinal bacterial infections are not only caused from contaminated food, but also from contaminated water, improper food handling or preparation, or from person-to-person spread (such as sexual activity, especially in men who have sex with men). In any causal study, investigators always adjust for the ‘usual suspects,’"" the memo says. Moreover, the memo notes that the study’s focus on illnesses identified in emergency rooms misses that people seek care at other places--or not at all--leaving the data incomplete. Alternatively, the memo says, laboratory-confirmed diagnoses reported to the health department are ""the proper basis for surveillance of microbiological data on these infections in our population."" The official went on to say there had been increases in some illnesses oft linked to food. Specifically, according to the memo, health department data show an increase in campylobacteriosis, one of the most common causes of diarrheal illness. Then again, the memo says, there was no detected increase in salmonellosis or enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, which is transmitted by food or water contaminated with animal or human feces. ""Interpreting these changes is not straightforward,"" the memo continues. ""The epidemiology of enteric pathogens in San Francisco differs compared to surrounding counties because we are an urban center with a larger population of ethnic immigrants and men who have sex with men (MSM),"" the memo states. ""Research studies need to adjust for these population differences."" The memo also disputes the professors’ conclusions about deaths going up after the bag ban, mostly by declaring that 111 of the 140 San Francisco deaths from 2001 through 2010 figuring into the paper were attributed to Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile--an intestinal infection most commonly tied to exposure to antibiotics, particularly among hospitalized patients. ""Foodborne exposures is not yet an established cause of C. difficile enterocolitis, but is an active area of research,"" the memo says, going on to say the authors shouldn’t have included C. difficile deaths in their analysis. Summing up, the memo says ""the idea that widespread use of reusable bags may cause gastrointestinal infections if they are not regularly cleaned is plausible. However, the hypothesis that there is a significant increase in gastrointestinal foodborne illnesses and deaths due to reusable bags has not been tested, much less demonstrated in this study. It would be a disservice to San Francisco residents and visitors to alarm them by claiming that it has been. It could be useful, however, to remind people to use safe food-handling practices, including maintaining the cleanliness of everything they use to transport, handle, and prepare food."" We asked San Francisco County if there had been any response by the professors to the county’s memo. Nancy Sarieh of the public health department told us by email: ""They did respond. We agreed to disagree and they have not updated their paper."" In February 2013, we otherwise noticed, commentator Debra J. Saunders of the San Francisco Chronicle quoted Klick saying he cannot ""rule out the possibility that there was something peculiar that happened in San Francisco."" A Texas expert Separately, we asked Dr. Philip Huang, the medical director for the Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department, to take a look at the paper posted by Penn plus the San Francisco County memo. Huang said by phone that the Penn paper, limited to ER admissions, missed the fact that individuals who take sick from food are treated by private doctors or don’t even seek health care. Notably too, Huang said, the researchers failed to consider the health surveillance data later cited by the county. ""I mean, who knows? You can get a spike"" in illness ""and there could have been something else going on in the community that is totally unrelated,"" Huang said. ""I think the people who are closest to the data in their own community would have the best perspective."" From ER admissions alone, Huang said, ""certainly the data is not there to make any conclusions about this."" Foundation notes other accounts Next, we circled back to Espinosa, the foundation spokeswoman, about the memo disputing the professors’ analysis and Huang’s comments. By email, Espinosa pointed out a 2011 peer-reviewed study, partly supported by the American Chemistry Council, finding that among reusable bags randomly collected from consumers entering grocery stores in the San Francisco area, Los Angeles and Tucson, E. coli were identified in 8 percent of bags plus a ""wide range of enteric bacteria,"" according to the authors including Charles P. Gerba of the University of Arizona. ""When meat juices were added to bags and stored in the trunks of cars for two hours, the number of bacteria increased 10-fold, indicating the potential for bacterial growth in the bags,"" the authors wrote. ""Hand or machine washing was found to reduce the bacteria in bags by > 99.9%. These results indicate that reusable bags, if not properly washed on a regular basis, can play a role in the cross-contamination of foods. "" Espinosa also noted a May 2012 Los Angeles Times news story describing an Oregon outbreak affecting nine soccer players who had come in contact with a reused grocery bag. The story said one of the girls got sick shortly after arrival, from a norovirus she presumably acquired prior to the trip, Dr. Kimberly K. Repp of the Oregon Health and Science University and Dr. William E. Keene of the Oregon Public Health Division reported in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. ""The sick girl was then isolated in the room of one of the chaperones,"" the Times reported. ""Nonetheless, eight other girls became ill. The investigation showed that the virus was found on a reusable grocery bag that had been used to store snacks for the team. It had, unfortunately, been stored in the bathroom,"" the story said. When the sick girl used the bathroom, the norovirus was aerosolized and deposited on the bag, where it was later transferred to other girls when they got snacks. Our ruling Quintero said that when San Francisco banned plastic grocery bags, ""you saw the number of instances of people going to the ER with things like salmonella and other related illnesses"" spike. This declaration relied on a study that took a correlation between ER cases and San Francisco’s phased-in bag ban to declare ties between the reported illnesses and the ban. However, the county raised serious questions about the study methodology and conclusions, which were overly simplistic",Mostly False,"November 23, 2016"
"Says Donald Trump said he intends ""to open up additional areas off the coast to oil drilling"" during the campaign.","Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson spent the week after the 2016 election fighting against a bill that would have steered more royalties from oil drilling to some Gulf states. Nelson’s state of Florida already bans offshore oil drilling near its coasts. But Nelson feared that by dangling more royalties, state leaders would be more open to drilling near Florida in the future. In a speech on the Senate floor Nov. 16, Nelson said President-elect Donald Trump’s position on the issue is concerning to environmentalists.   ""Ever since I was a young congressman, I’ve been fighting to keep oil rigs off of Florida’s coast,"" he said, ""and now it's especially important at this time as we have a new administration coming in that took a public position in the election declaring the president-elect's intent to open up additional areas off the coast to oil drilling."" The American Energy and Conservation Act of 2016, sponsored by Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., failed to get enough Senate votes to move forward on Nov. 17. But the future of oil drilling along coasts in Florida and the United States will remain a hot topic of conversation under Trump’s administration and potentially in Nelson’s re-election campaign in 2018. Here we will look at Trump’s position on opening up additional coastal areas to drill for oil. We heard back from Nelson’s office but not from Trump’s transition team. Donald Trump’s campaign position oil drilling Trump generally spoke in favor of offshore oil drilling during the campaign, although his position wasn’t always clear. He sounded skeptical about a proposal in Congress to allow offshore drilling closer to Florida in an interview with the Tampa Bay Times in February. ""They've already got plenty in the Gulf,"" Trump said. ""It would be a little bit of a shame (to expand drilling closer to Florida), because there's so much fracking, and there's so much oil that we have now that we never thought possible. That's an issue I'd absolutely study and do the right thing."" In 2006, Congress -- with input and support from Nelson -- passed a bill to ban oil drilling within 125 miles off much of Florida’s coast and up to 235 miles at some points. The ban is set to expire in 2022. In 2015, Cassidy introduced the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act, which would allow drilling 50 miles off Florida’s Gulf shores. In response, Nelson filed a bill to extend the ban by five years. Neither bill reached a Senate vote. Trump was more forceful about his support for drilling since that time in speeches and press releases that we found through our own research and in Trump’s statements sent to us by Nelson’s Senate spokesman. During the campaign, Trump’s America First Energy Plan called for opening up onshore and offshore leasing on federal lands, eliminating a moratorium on coal leasing, and opening shale energy deposits. Trump called for unleashing ""America’s $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil, and natural gas reserves, plus hundreds of years in clean coal reserves."" In a May 2016 speech to the North Dakota Petroleum Council, Trump said that in his first 100 days in office, he would ""lift moratoriums on energy production in federal area. We’re going to revoke policies that impose unwarranted restrictions on new drilling technologies. These technologies create millions of jobs with a smaller footprint than ever before."" He reiterated those views during a September 2016 speech at the 2016 Shale Insight Conference. Trump’s position has remained the same since he won After Trump won Nov. 8, his transition team posted an energy policy that stated the administration will open onshore and offshore leasing on federal lands and waters and streamline the permitting process for all energy projects. A few days after Trump won, one of his economic advisers, Stephen Moore, told NPR that Trump’s administration believes it can raise ""hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years"" by opening up more federal lands for leases for oil and gas development and coal development. On Nov. 18, the Obama administration took the opposite approach, banning offshore drilling in the Arctic as part of a new five-year plan for energy development in federal waters. Trump won’t be able to instantly toss Obama’s ban. His administration will have to prepare a report which could take as long as two years, and then the federal government would have to organize a sale of leases for companies that want to drill there, the Washington Post reported. Although Trump wants more drilling, he may have to wait years for it. CNBC reported that Trump’s plan to expand oil drilling probably won’t happen until his successor is in the White House. Reasons for delay include the years it takes to start projects, local and state governments sometimes oppose drilling, and market forces. Our ruling Nelson said that Trump said during the campaign he intends ""to open up additional areas off the coast to oil drilling."" In official campaign and transition team statements, Trump repeatedly has called for making it easier to drill for oil. He called for opening offshore areas and reducing ""unnecessary restrictions."" Since he won, Trump’s administration has reiterated its pro-drilling stance. He hasn't been so clear about his specific plans for Florida. In one interview, he appeared skeptical about expanding offshore drilling closer to Florida. He is limited in the extent that he could expand drilling anywhere near Florida’s coasts because current law bans it within at least 125 miles",Mostly True,"November 22, 2016"

Johnson’s record When Johnson and Feingold first ran against each other in 2010, Johnson definitively told the Journal Sentinel’s editorial board his position at the time:  ""I absolutely do not believe in the science of man-caused climate change. It’s not proven by any stretch of the imagination."" The far more likely cause, he said,  is ""sunspot activity or something just in the geologic eons of time where we have changes in the climate."" Ben Voelkel, a Johnson campaign spokesman, told us Johnson later acknowledged humans played a role in climate change in a 2014 interview with Boston Public Radio. ""There are other forces that cause climate to change,"" Johnson told Here and Now’s Robin Young. ""So climate does change and I don’t deny that man has some effect on that. It certainly has a great deal of effect on spoiling our environment in many different ways."" But Johnson softened his view as soon as the next sentence: ""I’ve got a very open mind, but I don’t have the arrogance that man can really do much to affect climate."" The next year, Johnson voted against a Senate amendment to affirm that human activity significantly contributes to climate change. While all but one senator supported an earlier amendment affirming the existence of climate change, only five Republicans this time voted to acknowledge there is a human impact. The amendment, seen as a symbolic effort by the Democrats to force GOP senators to take a position, failed 50 to 49 (it required a 3/5 majority). Meanwhile, an energy policy position that appeared on Johnson’s campaign website in 2015 questioned human’s impact on climate change: ""Man-made global warming remains unsettled science. World-renowned climate experts have raised serious objections to the theories behind these claims. I believe it is a bad idea to impose a policy that will raise taxes on every American, will balloon energy prices and will hurt our economic competiveness (sic) – especially on such uncertain predictions."" That passage has since been removed. In August 2016, when asked about global warming on WRJN-AM radio in Racine, Johnson seemed to think it settled — before tempering his response. ""Listen, man can affect the environment; no doubt about it,"" he said. ""The climate has always changed, it always will. … The question is, how much does man cause changes in our environment, changes in our climate, and what we could possibly even do about it?"" Since Feingold made the claim, Johnson’s statements have been a similarly mixed bag: He called himself a ""skeptic"" of man-made climate change in a meeting with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s editorial board Oct. 21, 2016. He downplayed the issue of global warming three days later — saying mankind flourishes in warmer weather — while admitting humans ""obviously"" play a role. But these statements aren’t relevant to a claim made weeks earlier. Our rating Feingold said Johnson ""doesn't even believe that there's a man-made role in climate change."" Johnson did not support a Senate amendment to acknowledge a man-made role in climate change and expressed skepticism each of the few times he acknowledged humans might contribute. He has acknowledged at times that humans can play a role but downplayed how significant that role might be",Mostly True,"October 31, 2016"
"""We are now, for the first time ever, energy independent.""","Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump says President Barack Obama’s administration has hindered energy production in the United States. ""Energy is under siege by the Obama administration,"" Trump said at the second presidential debate Oct. 9. ""Under absolute siege. The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies."" Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton replied that on the contrary, ""We are now, for the first time ever, energy independent."" Clinton’s claim that the United States is energy independent raised some eyebrows, so we decided to see if it was accurate. Some energy experts we spoke with said the United States is close enough to energy independence that it could prosper without importing energy from unstable or unfriendly countries. Others said the United States isn’t quite there yet, even though it’s trending that way. If the United States only used foreign energy sources, it would clearly be energy dependent. And if it only used domestic energy sources, it would clearly be energy independent. On this spectrum, the United States is definitely closer to independence than dependence, and getting closer every year. But it’s not at full energy independence yet. The United States still consumes about 11 percent more energy than it produces, so it has to import from other nations to meet that need. In 2015, the United States produced 87.9 quadrillion BTUs of energy and used 97.3 quadrillion BTUs, according to the Energy Information Administration, an office of the federal government. The United States imported about 11 quadrillion more BTUs of energy than it exported in 2015. This means ""the U.S. is not energy independent,"" said Kenneth Medlock, senior director of the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University. That said, imports have been trending down significantly since the mid 2000s. The EIA has projected that the United States will switch from a net importer of energy to a net exporter sometime between 2020 and 2030. ""The U.S. is not currently energy independent and, while it is moving toward energy independence, it is not expected to be so for about a decade,"" said Paul Holtberg, leader of the EIA’s Analysis Integration Team.  This shift is happening because of changes in both supply and demand. Domestic natural gas and oil production has skyrocketed since hydraulic fracturing, the extraction method known as fracking, came into regular use in the late 2000s. At the same time, Americans are using less energy as a result of growing efficiency. Clinton said the United States is energy independent for the ""first time ever."" However, going by net imports vs. net exports, the United States is currently a larger net importer than it was from the 1950s (as far back as the EIA data goes) through the 1970s, and again in the mid 1980s. So current net import levels are not unprecedented.  When people think of energy independence, they often think of oil because it’s the one source of energy that the United States has historically imported from potentially unstable areas. While the United States is essentially self-sufficient as it pertains to coal, natural gas and renewable energy sources, it still imports about 24 percent of its oil needs, even with the increase in fracking. Even so, Marilyn Brown, a professor of sustainable systems at Georgia Institute of Technology, told PolitiFact that she thinks the United States is energy independent because it could meet its oil needs from a friendly country, like Mexico or Canada, if the oil market in one of its other top supplier countries became unstable. North America as a whole is arguably energy independent, in that it produces all the energy it consumes on a net basis, several experts pointed out. While Clinton’s claim that the United States is at present energy independent might not be fully correct numerically, the spirit of the claim is on target because the country is becoming less and less dependent on foreign sources, said global energy expert Amy Myers Jaffe, executive director for Energy and Sustainability at University of California, Davis. While the United States is interwoven with the world energy market, if for some reason ""all our fuel had to be produced in the United States, we could do it,"" she said. Our ruling Clinton said, ""We are now, for the first time ever, energy independent."" The United States imports more energy than it exports, and it consumes more energy than it produces domestically. So the United States still relies on foreign energy sources for about 11 percent of its energy consumption needs. However, this import-export gap is trending down. The EIA predicts the United States’ energy exports and imports will balance in the not-so-distant future. That said, imports and exports have been balanced in previous decades. The United States is on track to energy independence, but it’s not there yet",False,"October 11, 2016"
"Says ""Hillary Clinton set aside environmental and labor rules to help a South Korean company with a record of violating workers’ rights set up what amounts to a sweatshop in Haiti.""","Hillary Clinton is facing criticism for her role in facilitating the creation of an industrial park in post-earthquake Haiti that has been accused of displacing farmers and failing to live up to rosy job creation projections. Among the charges, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said Clinton pushed aside regulations to create sweatshop-like conditions. ""Hillary Clinton set aside environmental and labor rules to help a South Korean company with a record of violating workers’ rights set up what amounts to a sweatshop in Haiti,"" Trump said Sept. 6, 2016. Clinton, as secretary of state, certainly lauded the project as part of a plan to revitalize Haiti following the devastating earthquake in 2010, and the U.S. government financially supported it. But did she help a company create a sweatshop? The evidence is thin. The Caracol Industrial Park In 2010, Haiti’s leaders unveiled a plan to spur growth beyond the capital city of Port-au-Prince. One project that emerged was to build an industrial park on the country’s northern coast a little over a mile from Caracol Bay. It was going to bring tens of thousands of good-paying jobs, government officials said. Getting it off the ground took a collaboration among the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, the government of Haiti, and a South Korean clothing maker, Sae-A Trading. Sae-A, under the name of S&H Global, would be the anchor tenant of the new industrial park, producing clothes for clients such as Target and Walmart. Bill and Hillary Clinton, champions of that vision, came to the park’s grand opening. In fact, both of them lobbied hard for the project. Bill Clinton in his role as special envoy to Haiti pushed for expanded garment making. Sae-A said Clinton herself invited the company to build a factory at the industrial park. The U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $170 million to support the industrial park by building a power plant and improving the port. ""What is happening here in Caracol is already having ripple effects that will create jobs and opportunities far beyond this industrial park,"" Hillary Clinton said at the Caracol opening ceremony. But that really hasn't happened. The industrial park has been beseiged by criticism of millions of dollars wasted, displaced farmers and sluggish job growth. Today, four years, later, total employment is about 8,100. (The State Department told us after publication that new data show the facility now employs about 9,400 people.) That's the background. Now, we'll look at the specifics of Trump's claim. Clinton's role in environmental and labor rules  Trump said Clinton ""set aside environmental and labor rules"" to make the project a reality. The Trump campaign pointed to an article that appeared in the New York Times. That report cited environmentalists decrying the placement of the industrial zone near a sensitive marine habitat. The U.S. Treasury Department abstained from voting on the project due to concerns over the limited environmental impact studies that had been prepared. That's not the same as Clinton setting aside rules, and people involved with the project said Clinton played no role. Charles Krakoff, managing partner of the consulting firm Koios Associates, created the environmental impact report in an assessment for the government of Haiti and the Inter-American Development Bank. Krakoff told us that the Haitians, the development bank and USAID pressed for a quick turnaround, and he agrees that his firm did not produce a full long-term analysis. But he said he did address the immediate impacts and laid out the sort of studies needed later. The Inter-American Development Bank followed through. It commissioned a more comprehensive study in 2014, which was completed in August 2016. ""Environmental standards were not changed for this project,"" Krakoff said. USAID produced a separate environmental impact study for the power plant alone. Importantly, Krakoff said the key decision to place the industrial park in Caracol was made by the government of Haiti not Clinton. Whatever environmental issues that raised flowed from that point forward and Clinton played no role. ""We told them two other locations would be better, but the government wanted it in Caracol,"" Krakoff said. ""The Haitians and the Inter-American Development Bank had more say in this project than the United States."" Sae-A's record on workers' rights Clinton, as we already said, did play a part in getting Sae-A to Haiti, and Sae-A does not have a perfect record with workers. The company had a significant dispute with the union at a factory in Guatemala. The AFL-CIO accused it of anti-union repression including ""acts of violence and intimidation."" Sae-A ultimately abandonned that Guatemalan factory. But, in 2008, the International Trade Union Confederation highlighted the company as one of only three in Guatemala that had unions at all and met with union representatives weekly to discuss working conditions. We found an academic article that accurately described an episode when Sae-A managers at one plant in Guatemala used police to intimidate union organizers. The researcher cited a WikiLeaks cable from 2005 as proof, but failed to note that the cable went on to say that when the government and the company found out what happened, it fired all the managers involved and reinstated the workers with back pay. In Nicaragua, a 2013 investigation of a clash between union supporters and non-union workers found that Sae-A did nothing to prevent the unrest. So, the evidence that Sae-A violated workers rights is limited. The company had a dispute with its unions in Guatemala and allowed a fight to break out between union and non-union workers in Nicaragua. Is Sae-A running a sweatshop? Many factories in Haiti are subject to six-month inspections by Better Work Haiti, a project of the International Labor Organization. The latest assessment raises a few points of concern, but nothing that would in any way meet the definition of sweatshop conditions. On the contrary, the report lists several strengths, including providing ""free, first-class education to the workers’ kids."" The company provides paid sick and maternity leave, which according to the company, has been used in 6,336 and 220 cases respectively in 2016. There are three unions in the factory representing about 30 percent of all workers. Safety and health conditions passed muster in the assessment. The issues raised were isolated, or due more to workers not using safety equipment (ear plugs) that the company gave them (and trained them on why they should use them.) Inspectors and the company have a dispute on the legal definition for holiday, sick and maternity leave pay that has been referred to the government for resolution.Of workers who are paid based on how much they produce, only 41 percent make the government’s target minimum wage, which suggests much improvement is needed, although the inspectors did not say this made the company non-compliant with the law. Pay is a point of broader concern. The advocacy group Worker Rights Consortium issued a report in 2013 that accused Sae-A of ""ongoing theft of legally-earned wages."" But when we asked the executive director if this met the criteria of operating a sweatshop, he declined to comment. The AFL-CIO also failed to respond to questions about Sae-A. Our ruling Trump said Clinton ""set aside environmental and labor rules to help a South Korean company with a record of violating workers’ rights set up what amounts to a sweatshop in Haiti."" There is no evidence that Clinton set aside environmental and labor rules and Trump exaggerated about the record of the South Korean company in question",Mostly False,"October 11, 2016"
"Says ""Rob Portman voted for the bipartisan bill to affirm climate change is real, humans significantly contribute to it and it needs to be addressed.""","ClearPath Action Fund, a conservative clean-energy and environmental PAC, cheered U.S. Sen. Rob Portman in a digital ad, calling him a ""clean energy champion."" The ad said of the Republican senator, ""Rob Portman voted for the bipartisan bill to affirm climate change is real, humans significantly contribute to it and it needs to be addressed."" PolitiFact previously looked into how many Republicans in Congress say they believe that climate change is real, and caused by human activity. The Republican lawmakers we identified who affirm climate change included Rep. Michael Grimm, N.Y.; Sen. Susan Collins, Maine; Sen. Lamar Alexander, Tenn.; Sen. Mark Kirk, Ill.; Rep. Chris Smith, N.J.; Sen. Bob Corker, Tenn.; Sen. John Thune, S.D.; and Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, N.J. Portman didn’t make PolitiFact’s list, so we wanted to clarify his climate change stance. We asked ClearPath Action Fund for the sources they used to champion Portman’s position, and a spokesman sent us three links. The first two were votes on amendments to the Keystone XL Pipeline Act in January 2015 (which was after PolitiFact did its roundup of Republicans who believe in climate change). The climate change amendments were only symbolic gauges of the ""sense of the Senate."" Portman voted ""yea"" on the first, introduced by Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, ""to express the sense of the Senate that climate change is real and not a hoax."" That amendment passed. Portman also voted in support of a second amendment by Republican Sen. John Hoeven, a Keystone bill sponsor, which said that human activity affects climate change, but still supported the passage of the pipeline bill. That amendment fell short of the required 60 by one vote, and Hoeven himself voted against it.   So far, so good for ClearPath Action Fund. Here's how one wrong word — ""significantly"" — pulls the PAC's praise for Portman's record into negative territory.  A Democrat, Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, inched the global warming language a step further, calling for a vote on an amendment that stated ""human activity significantly contributes to climate change."" The adverb represents the crux of the partisan divide over climate change. The word ""significantly"" was significant enough for Portman to vote against that amendment, along with almost all of his fellow Republicans. Collins, Kirk, Alexander, Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and Kelly Ayotte (N.H.) broke party lines and voted in favor.  Portman has explained in interviews that he doesn’t want to qualify the impact that human activity has on the climate because ""scientists have different views on that."" These word gymnastics are necessary for Portman because of his large constituency in Ohio coal country. Coal-burning power plants provide 44 percent of the electricity used in the U.S., but are the biggest contributor to air pollution, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.  ""Sense of the Senate resolutions are done for messaging reasons, either in an attempt to move the policy debate, or to provide political cover of some sort. I think you had both types in play with the Keystone vote,"" said David Jenkins, president at Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship. More recently, Portman voted for an amendment proposed by Graham that stated, ""Climate change is real; human activity contributes to climate change,"" and that ""the United States should be a world leader in addressing climate change…(and) Congress has a responsibility to take actions that reduce emissions and combat climate change..."" Absent, again, is the word ""significantly."" But it is in the language of the ClearPath Action ad: ""Rob Portman voted for the bipartisan bill to affirm climate change is real, humans significantly contribute to it and it needs to be addressed."" ClearPath Action’s communications director, Darren Goode, responded immediately to PolitiFact via email, and said the group had made an ""honest mistake"" by including the s-word. ""We have already pulled that video down and will fix it to reflect that,"" Goode wrote.   While ClearPath Action confers ""clean energy champion"" status to Portman, at least two other environmental groups beg to differ. The National Resources Defense Council has regularly hammered Portman for sponsoring such measures as a budget amendment to allow states to opt out of the 1970 Clean Art Act and Clean Power Plan requirements for cutting carbon pollution. Likewise, the League of Conservation Voters gives Portman a low rating on their scorecard for his voting record on environmentally impactful measures. Our ruling An ad by ClearPath Action said, ""Rob Portman voted for the bipartisan bill to affirm climate change is real, humans significantly contribute to it and it needs to be addressed."" While Portman did vote for a bipartisan bill recognizing climate change as a threat in need of action, that bill did not include the word ""significantly."" Portman has voted against other amendments when they include the word ""significantly,"" and has voted for amendments that do not quantify how much human activity affects climate change. ClearPath Action has since discontinued the ad, admitted the mistake and pledged to release a corrected version",Mostly False,"October 10, 2016"
"Says she ""voted for a statewide fracking ban.""","In an attempt to position herself as a more environmentally-friendly candidate, state Rep. Dana Young, R-Tampa, has sent mailers touting her vote for a recent bill targeting fracking. The effects of the legislation Young voted for are not as clear cut as the claim Young makes. A third-party group supporting Young, who is facing Democrat Bob Buesing for state Senate in the newly created District 18, sent the mailer in the last weeks of September that says she ""voted for a statewide fracking ban to protect our water."" The group, the Florida Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, paid for the mailpiece, but the mailer says that Young approved the message. So we are putting Young on the Truth-O-Meter.  The mailer refers to Young’s vote on House Bill 191, legislation aimed at regulating fracking in Florida. We were curious about the Young’s statement and the specifics of the measure. As we looked further into the bill, we found the mailer is somewhat misleading. What Young voted for would have regulated fracking, but it wouldn’t have permanently banned it. A closer look at House Bill 191 HB 191, dubbed ""Regulation of Oil and Gas Resources,"" was sponsored by Rep. Ray Rodrigues, R-Estero, and passed 73 to 45 on Jan. 27 in the Florida House. Young voted in favor of this bill, along with 72 other Republicans, while 38 Democrats and 7 Republicans opposed the bill. Young reasoned that HB 191 could have been the first step to a permanent ban on fracking. However, the bill only called for a temporary moratorium on the process, not a ""ban"" like her mailer says. Democrats who voted against the bill echoed arguments of environmental groups and said a temporary ban doesn’t go far enough to protect Florida’s water. Had the bill passed (it was defeated in a Florida Senate committee), the measure would have allowed Florida to regulate fracking — a process that involves pumping large amounts of water, sand and chemicals into the ground to harness oil and gas reserves. Per the bill, fracking permits would not have been issued until a study was completed in 2017 by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. The DEP would have proposed rules based on the study’s results, which would have been subject to approval of the Legislature. Point being, the bill was never intended to ban fracking permanently, but place a moratorium on the practice while its effects were studied. Democrats also took issue with the fact the bill would have prohibited Florida's counties and cities from passing local bans against fracking. According to the Miami Herald, 41 cities and 27 counties oppose fracking. St. Petersburg has passed a resolution against hydraulic fracturing, along with Broward County, which outlawed fracking in January. In addition, there were several amendments to HB191 offered up by Democrats that would have created more safeguards against fracking, including a restriction on what chemicals can be used and studies on prenatal health, but they didn’t pass. Young voted against some of these, but her spokesperson said those issues were unnecessary, trusting the DEP study would have addressed those concerns. Young’s office said she strongly opposes fracking in Florida and will continue to seek a statewide ban. Our ruling A mailer from Young says she ""voted for a statewide ban on fracking."" That vote is in reference to HB 191, which would have set up a temporary moratorium on fracking in anticipation of future regulations. The bill would have authorized a study on which to base further regulation. It was not an outright ban on fracking.

"""Not one penny of (California’s Prop 67) bag ban tax goes to the environment.""","A ‘Yes’ vote on California’s Proposition 67 would ban thin plastic carryout bags at grocery and convenience stores statewide. The ban is supported by environmental groups that argue the bags choke wildlife and cause problems for recycling centers when they wrap around machinery. Along with imposing the ban, Prop 67 would also mandate that stores charge customers a minimum 10 cent fee on the other carry-out options they supply, such as paper or heavy duty plastic bags. The No on 67 campaign has seized on this 10 cent charge, calling it a tax and claiming it does nothing to fund environmental protections. ""Don’t be fooled: Not one penny of the bag ban tax goes to the environment,"" the No on 67 campaign claimed in its official ballot argument against the proposition. No on 67 is led by a plastics industry trade association. The same group introduced a competing ballot measure, Proposition 65, which would redirect the bag fee money to an environmental fund administered by the state Wildlife Conservation Board. We wondered if the No on 67 claim is accurate. Does any money from the charge go to environmental causes?  California's Prop 67 would ban thin plastic grocery carryout bags statewide and impose a 10 cent fee on other store options such as paper or heavy duty plastic. Photo by Jae C. Hong / Associated Press Our research Prop 67 is a referendum on a law Gov. Jerry Brown signed two years ago banning plastic carryout bags statewide. The plastics industry challenged it, placing the law on hold. The measure is also known as the ""California Plastic Bag Ban Veto Referendum."" It would apply to grocery and convenience stores, large pharmacies and liquor stores. Notably, the No on 67 campaign uses the word ""tax"" rather than charge or fee in its claim. The term doesn’t fit, as the revenue goes to stores, not a government agency. A spokeswoman for the No on 67 campaign said its claim is backed up by the text of the ballot measure, which says the 10 cent charge (it doesn’t use the term ‘tax’) would be ""retained by the store and … used only for specified purposes."" The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office examined Prop 67 and found ""stores would retain the revenue from the sale of the bags."" It went on to say: ""They could use the proceeds to cover the costs of providing carryout bags, complying with the measure, and educational efforts to encourage the use of reusable bags."" Steven Maviglio, a spokesman for the Yes on 67 campaign, acknowledged there’s no requirement for stores to fund beach cleanups, land preservation or similar environmental efforts. That doesn’t mean there’s no environmental upside to the 10 cent charge, he said. ""The environmental benefit of charging for the actual average cost of bags (versus) giving those bags for free, is that consumers use substantially fewer bags,"" Maviglio said in an email. ""Fewer bags, even fewer recycled paper bags, means a smaller environmental footprint."" He pointed to a 2012 report by the city of San Jose to back up that statement. San Jose is among the more than 100 cities or counties in California that already ban plastic grocery bags. The city’s plastic bag ordinance includes a 10 cent charge on paper bags retained by stores. Comparing periods before and after the ban, the report found an 89 percent reduction in bag litter in San Jose’s storm drain system; and about a 60 percent reduction in the city’s creeks, rivers, streets and neighborhoods. In Santa Cruz County, Laura Kasa of Save our Shores told the Santa Cruz Sentinel in 2013 her group has witnessed a reduction of bags collected during cleanups ""because of the four bans which took effect (in the county) in 2012."" Our ruling The No on 67 campaign claims ""Not one penny of the bag ban tax goes to the environment."" A large portion of this is correct: Nothing requires the bag fee revenue be spent directly on environmental causes, as found by the state’s nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. But the claim ignores the indirect benefit the fee could have on the environment. Supporters make a fair point that the fee will persuade customers to use reusable bags, thus cutting down on river- and creek-choking plastic bags.

"""No fracking waste is being dumped in New York State""","When New York State officials banned fracking in late 2014, environmentalists celebrated a victory against the controversial natural gas extraction method. Then last year, a report said waste from the process was still coming into the state. Lawmakers grilled Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Basil Seggos at a water quality hearing in Albany. He contradicted the report. ""No fracking waste is being dumped in New York State, and those who perpetrated that are wrong,"" Seggos said at the hearing. ""There's no high volume hydraulic fracturing going on in New York. It's going on in other states. No waste from those other states is coming into New York."" Environmental advocates, however, point to information from Pennsylvania’s Department of Environmental Protection that indicates trucks carry fracking waste from the Keystone State to landfills in upstate New York. So do upstate landfills accept fracking waste? The Department of Environmental Protection in Pennsylvania confirmed that landfills in New York State took in fracking waste. We looked into what kinds of waste comes into the state, and which ones do not. Waste brought into New York Fracking is different from traditional gas drilling. Instead of drilling a well straight into the ground, a company first drills vertically, then directs the well horizontally. The drillers then blast porous rock with fluid to extract natural gas. Regulations by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation block any waste more than 80 percent liquid from being dumped into landfills. That prevents liquid fracking waste, like flowback water, from being brought into the state for disposal. But any solid waste that may have come in contact with fracking liquids is permitted under current regulations. Data from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection shows three New York State landfills this year accepted waste from high volume hydraulic-fractured drilling.  According to a database from the Pennsylvania agency, the Chemung County Landfill took more than 15,000 tons of waste, including what’s listed as drill cuttings, synthetic liner materials, servicing fluid, soil contaminated by oil- and gas-related spills, and ""other oil and gas wastes."" Hakes C&D Landfill in Steuben County took in about 1,900 tons of drill cuttings. Hyland Facility Association in Allegany County took 550 tons of soil contaminated by oil- and gas- related spills. The definitions of this waste from the state of Pennsylvania are vague. We spoke with Scott Perry from the Pennsylvania environmental agency for a better understanding. Perry said any soil contaminated by an oil- or gas-related spill more often than not comes in contact with flowback water - a mixture of fluids and chemicals used during the fracking process. ""The most commonly spilled material is flowback water,"" Perry said. ""Drilling fluids and diesel are probably the next most common."" Companies are not required to detail what they include in the ""other oil and gas wastes"" category. Perry said it’s considered a catch-all for waste that does not fit any other description. He said it could mean anything from the packaging used to store chemicals before they are used for fracking to broken equipment. Synthetic liner materials are thick mats or liners used to prevent chemicals and other waste from leaking into the ground. Perry said any residue is washed from the liners before they’re transported for disposal. Servicing fluid is used to maintain the wells and can include a water/oil-based mud and foam. All three New York State facilities that received waste this year are owned by Casella, a landfill operator. When we contacted one of the landfills, they said they do perform analytics on the waste as it’s brought to the facility, but a message to Casella for details was not returned. We also reached out to both companies that operate the wells where the waste came from, but neither responded to our request for more information. As recently as last year, one facility in Syracuse was still accepting fluid that the Pennsylvania agency says includes brine from fracking. But no records indicate any New York State facility has accepted the fluids this year. Landfills accepted flowback waste from fracking as recently as 2013. The state's response We contacted the Department of Environmental Conservation about the contradiction between Seggos's statement and the Pennsylvania database. In a statement, the department said any drilling waste brought into the state was strictly regulated. In the same statement, the department said waste from fracking was not allowed in the state. ""Given recent public statements from advocates, it is important to set the record straight regarding the disposal and use of high volume hydraulic fracturing waste,"" said Kevin Frazier from the Department of Environmental Conservation. ""Under Gov. Cuomo’s leadership, New York State banned high volume hydraulic fracturing and prohibits the use and disposal of any high volume hydraulic fracturing waste or fluids, including brines, anywhere in the state."" ""DEC also strictly regulates the State’s four landfills that currently accept drill cuttings from drilling operations. These landfills employ radiation detectors to ensure that no regulated radioactive materials are received by the facility. In addition, DEC staff provide on-site oversight and inspection to ensure operations are in compliance with state regulations."" The DEC said it is ""in the process of strengthening these already robust regulations."" A public review and comment period about the proposed revisions ended Sept. 13, Frazier said. When asked to clarify the confusion over banning some waste while accepting others, the DEC did not offer a clear response. Our ruling During a hearing on water quality, Basil Seggos, the New York State commissioner for environmental conservation, said ""no fracking waste is being dumped in New York State."" Data from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection indicates waste from fracking is transported from Pennsylvania’s wells to three landfills in New York. The waste was transported as recently as earlier this year. Well operators did not report sending any flowback or fluid waste from fracking to New York State this year, but they have in years past",False,"September 30, 2016"

The ad then shows a clip of Curbelo talking about protecting the environment and then pivots to a clip of him on an oil rig. The narrator continues: ""Curbelo supports drilling offshore just like Trump, and Curbelo repeatedly voted against President Obama's ability to fight pollution and combat climate change."" Curbelo represents a Democratic-leaning Westchester-to-Key West district. He faces a rematch Nov. 8 with former U.S. Rep. Joe Garcia, D-Miami. (Curbelo does not support Trump but said he won’t vote for Hillary Clinton, either.) We found that Curbelo supports current drilling but opposes an expansion near Florida’s coasts. And while Curbelo has taken some votes related to pollution and climate change that Democrats criticize, he has been one of the more outspoken Republicans about combating climate change.   Trump on drilling Trump has generally spoken in favor of offshore oil drilling in recent months, although his position hasn’t always been clear. He sounded skeptical about expanding offshore drilling in an interview with the Tampa Bay Times in February. ""They've already got plenty in the Gulf,"" Trump said. ""It would be a little bit of a shame (to expand drilling closer to Florida), because there's so much fracking, and there's so much oil that we have now that we never thought possible. That's an issue I'd absolutely study and do the right thing."" But Trump has been more forceful about his support for drilling since that time. ""We’re going to revoke policies that impose unwarranted restrictions on new drilling technologies,"" he said in North Dakota in May. In September, Trump said in a fact sheet that he will ""open up vast areas of our offshore energy resources for safe production"" and will eliminate ""unnecessary restrictions"" on offshore oil and gas. ‘Curbelo supports drilling offshore’ While Curbelo defended current offshore oil drilling in 2015, he has fought against efforts to expand it closer to Florida than the current 125-mile restriction. Curbelo made a video of himself standing on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico in 2015: ""The offshore oil industry in the United States fuels about 20 percent of our economy and assets like this are an important part of an all-of-the-above energy strategy that will grow the American economy and make our country more secure,"" he said. But Curbelo has voted three times in favor of Democratic amendments to protect coasts from drilling by banning funds, research or testing. He also got the House to pass a bill to force companies that spill oil in foreign waters to clean up any damage to Florida coasts. ‘Repeatedly voted against President Obama's ability to fight pollution and combat climate change’ The Democrats point to a handful of votes that Curbelo took that were contrary to Democratic efforts to fight pollution and climate change. In all four cases, Curbelo sided with Republicans in party line votes on legislation or a resolution. But the votes are cherry-picking Curbelo’s record, which also reflects his efforts to combat climate change and pollution. • In January Curbelo took a stand along with virtually all Republicans against a controversial proposal by the federal government to define which bodies of water fall under its jurisdiction. Curbelo thought the ""Waters of the United States"" rule was too vague and it was later stayed by the courts. • In 2015, Curbelo voted in favor of a bill Republicans said would prevent the EPA from using ""secret science"" and require transparency. The EPA argued it already is transparent and uses sound science. • The only vote directly about climate change was minor. The House, along with Curbelo, barred funds for a government climate model program in 2015. Curbelo opposed it because he said it was duplicative, National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Chris Pack said. • Curbelo also voted in favor of a bill to limit environmental reviews to move projects along in 2015. Importantly, the ad omits that Curbelo has been one of the leading Republican voices in Congress to come up with solutions to combat climate change. In September 2015, Curbelo signed onto a congressional resolution acknowledging climate change’s existence and later, along with U.S. Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., formed the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus. ""It is vital for Congress to acknowledge the reality of climate change as a legitimate issue requiring feasible solutions, and we need leaders on both sides of the aisle to pursue policies that will make a difference,"" Curbelo wrote in an op-ed in the Miami Herald Oct. 24, 2015. We found other actions that Curbelo took in an effort to fight pollution. In December 2015, Curbelo was one of 10 Republicans to vote against a resolution to nullify the EPA’s rules to regulate carbon emissions from new power plants. In July 2016, Curbelo opposed a vote by a Florida commission to increase allowed levels of toxins for over two dozen known chemicals in waterways.   Our ruling The DCCC said,""Curbelo supports drilling offshore just like Trump and Curbelo repeatedly voted against President Obama's ability to fight pollution and combat climate change."" Curbelo supports current drilling, but the ad omits that he has repeatedly voted against expanding drilling off Florida’s coasts. Trump, though not always consistent, has sounded more favorable to drilling than Curbelo. Curbelo has taken votes against Democratic efforts to curb pollution and to model climate change, but that is cherry-picking his record. The ad omits that Curbelo has been a leader among Republicans speaking out about the need to combat climate change",Mostly False,"September 29, 2016"
"""I did not — I did not — I do not say that. I do not say that"" climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.","Amid a discussion about how to boost the U.S. economy, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said her opponent Donald Trump ""thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese."" ""I think it’s real,"" she said during a Sept. 26 debate in New York. ""I think science is real."" Trump interrupted. ""I did not — I did not — I do not say that. I do not say that,"" he said. Well, it turns out he did say that climate change is a ""hoax"" of Chinese origin — as we’ve found in previous fact-checks. On Nov. 6, 2012, Trump tweeted, ""The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.""  So Trump clearly did say, at least once, that climate change was a Chinese hoax. The subject of this 2012 tweet came up during a Jan. 18, 2016, episode of Fox & Friends. In that interview, Trump indicated the tweet was a joke. ""Well, I think the climate change is just a very, very expensive form of tax,"" Trump said. ""A lot of people are making a lot of money. I know much about climate change. I'd be — received environmental awards. And I often joke that this is done for the benefit of China. Obviously, I joke. But this is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change. They burn everything you could burn; they couldn't care less. They have very — you know, their standards are nothing. But they — in the meantime, they can undercut us on price. So it's very hard on our business."" (Emphasis added.) Trump may call the mention of China’s role a joke, but he certainly has a lengthy record of using the word ""hoax"" to describe climate change. (For the record, in 2014 we rated a claim that climate change is a ""hoax"" Pants on Fire.) Here are a few examples: On Dec. 30, 2015, Trump told the crowd at a rally in Hilton Head, S.C., ""Obama's talking about all of this with the global warming and … a lot of it's a hoax. It's a hoax. I mean, it's a money-making industry, okay? It's a hoax, a lot of it."" On Jan. 25, 2014, Trump tweeted, ""NBC News just called it the great freeze — coldest weather in years. Is our country still spending money on the GLOBAL WARMING HOAX?""  On Jan. 29, 2014, Trump tweeted: ""Snowing in Texas and Louisiana, record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond. Global warming is an expensive hoax!""  That same day, he tweeted, ""Give me clean, beautiful and healthy air - not the same old climate change (global warming) bullshit! I am tired of hearing this nonsense.""  Trump also called climate change a ""hoax"" on the Jan. 6, 2014, edition of Fox & Friends. In addition, he said on the Sept. 24, 2015, edition of CNN’s New Day, ""I don’t believe in climate change."" Our ruling Trump said,  ""I did not — I did not — I do not say that. I do not say that"" climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. He certainly did say it — in a tweet four years ago. While he has since described that remark as a ""joke,"" Trump has repeatedly called climate change a ""hoax"" in speeches, tweets and media appearances. And he has said as recently as Jan. 18, 2016, that action on climate change ""is done for the benefit of China."" Because he hasn’t pushed this exact theory in recent years, as far as we’ve seen, there’s a tiny grain of truth to Trump’s claim. But it’s still inaccurate",Mostly False,"September 26, 2016"
"Says Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine ""want to shut down shale, and shut down natural gas.""","The weekend before the first presidential debate, Donald Trump went to Roanoke, Va., to talk about energy. ""Here, in Virginia, we are going to end the war on American energy and on our miners. Hillary Clinton says she wants to put the miners out of work,"" Trump said. ""Clinton and (vice presidential candidate Tim) Kaine also want to shut down shale, and shut down natural gas. What they've done is incredible."" Shale has become a dominant source of fossil fuels in the United States, thanks to a controversial process known as fracking. It wrings natural gas out of bedrock in a process that was once not considered profitable for extracting oil or natural gas. The process is efficient enough that the country's dependence on petroleum imports has declined precipitously. We wondered if the Clinton team wants to shut down fracking and the natural gas it produces. Trump's evidence Natural gas, composed mostly of methane, is extracted from shale rock by injecting it with pressurized water, sand and chemicals. Supporters note that burning it produces far less pollution than other types of fossil fuel. Critics say the process can cause earthquakes, water contamination and the unwanted release of methane, a gas renowned for trapping heat, which makes it a big player in climate change. When we contacted the Trump campaign, spokesman Jeff Wood sent us to a transcript of the March 6, 2016, Democratic presidential debate in Flint, Mich., where Clinton and her primary opponent, Bernie Sanders, were asked about fracking. Sanders said he opposed it unconditionally. Clinton, who had come under fire by Sanders for her support of the technology, was less absolute. ""I don’t support it when any locality or any state is against it, number one,"" Clinton told the crowd. ""I don’t support it when the release of methane or contamination of water is present. I don’t support it — number three — unless we can require that anybody who fracks has to tell us exactly what chemicals they are using."" ""So by the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place,"" she continued. ""And I think that’s the best approach, because right now, there are places where fracking is going on that are not sufficiently regulated. So first, we’ve got to regulate everything that is currently underway, and we have to have a system in place that prevents further fracking unless conditions like the ones that I just mentioned are met."" When we looked at this issue previously, we found evidence that Clinton had been supportive of fracking as secretary of state. She promoted it for Latin America, China, India and the European Union. In a 2009 speech, Clinton said: ""Now, I know that in some places it's controversial. But natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel available for power generation today, and a number of countries in the Americas may have shale gas resources."" She did, however, call for ""smart regulations"" on the practice. In an April debate against Sanders in Brooklyn, N.Y., Clinton was asked about her past statements as secretary of state. Clinton characterized natural gas as a ""bridge"" between dirty fuels, such as coal, and clean renewable energy, and said she was promoting it to other countries as a way to get European countries away from Russian sources. ""So we did say natural gas is a bridge. We want to cross that bridge as quickly as possible, because in order to deal with climate change, we have got to move as rapidly as we can,"" she said. Shut down fracking? Only a minority of states have banned fracking. Vermont was the first in 2012 and New York followed in 2014. Maryland has a moratorium on the practice through next year. Some municipalities have banned it as well. As for places with the unwanted release of methane — known as ""fugitive emissions"" — a 2015 study found that would apply to roughly one in 25 facilities. On the issue of water pollution, fracking critic Robert Howarth of Cornell University has estimated that 4 percent of production wells pollute water. And a 2015 EPA study said there were 151 cases of fracking spills in 11 states between 2006 and 2012.. When it comes to disclosing the chemicals used in the process, the impact of Clinton's rules would not be large. According to the American Chemical Society, 26 of the 28 states where fracking is done already have some disclosure rules, although those rules may not provide complete disclosure because they often drilling companies to protect what are regarded as trade secrets. It seems likely that if Clinton's ideas were put in place, drillers in the remaining two states could simply disclose the ingredients of their fracking solution the way drillers in other states have. When we asked the Clinton campaign about Trump's allegation, spokesman Josh Schwerin directed us to her campaign website and this statement: ""Switching to natural gas has avoided thousands of premature deaths and more than 100,000 asthma attacks by improving air quality, while creating good paying jobs and careers and helping reduce U.S. carbon pollution to its lowest level in 20 years,"" Clinton is quoted as saying. ""With strong safeguards in place, natural gas can play an important role in our transition to a clean energy economy . . . As President, I will ensure natural gas production is safe and responsible in those communities that choose to pursue it."" The Clinton campaign said she and Kaine agree on fracking and natural gas. Our ruling Trump said that Clinton and Kaine ""want to shut down shale, and shut down natural gas."" Trump's campaign points to Clinton's statements that she wants to put restrictions on the fracking process used to extract natural gas from shale, and she wants to move the world away from petroleum sources as quickly as possible. But a review of Clinton's statements also make clear that she supports natural gas as a cleaner alternative to coal and oil. Her restrictions would not shut down fracking or natural gas production",Half True,"September 25, 2016"
"Says ""Patrick Murphy’s ‘Pay More’ energy agenda means you could pay another $500 a year for your utility bills!""","An anti-regulation group is accusing U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy of wanting to use the Senate to adopt policies that would raise the cost of just about everything, starting with your utility bills. ""Vote against Patrick Murphy,"" reads a mailer we received Sept. 12, 2016, from Americans for Prosperity Florida. ""We can’t afford his ‘Pay More’ agenda."" The flier cautions electricity and grocery prices will go up as wages go down with Murphy in the Senate. ""Patrick Murphy’s ‘Pay More’ energy agenda means you could pay another $500 a year for your utility bills!"" the flier warns. The group behind the attack is the Florida affiliate of the main political committee for the anti-tax industrialists and billionaires Charles and David Koch. We wondered just what Murphy would be planning that would make utility costs go up $500 annually. There’s a tenuous link between what the Jupiter Democrat supports and the future of energy costs, but it’s not nearly as charged as AFP claimed. Shockingly high The ""Pay More"" Murphy nickname, which is being used by AFP in other attacks, is borne of Murphy’s support for President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan. The plan was a proposed environmental rule announced by the White House in August 2015. The new regulations would require power plants to reduce carbon emissions, from 2005 levels, by 32 percent by 2030. (A 2014 draft of the plan had sought a 30 percent reduction. We’ll get back to why this is important in a moment.) The idea was largely to promote cleaner sources of energy than coal-fired power plants, fostering more renewable energy while pushing utilities to upgrade existing infrastructure. But the U.S. Supreme Court put the rule on hold on Feb. 9, 2016, in the face of opposition from corporations and industry groups. Murphy has publicly supported its implementation, signing an amicus brief supporting the plan and calling the court’s decision to block the rule ""misguided."" But as a congressman, Murphy has no direct say over the fate of the final rule, which was created by the Obama administration and would be enacted by the Environmental Protection Agency. So what’s this about surging utility prices? Critics of the Clean Power Plan say it would be expensive for utilities to comply with the new emissions standards, and those costs would be passed on to consumers. An array of reports that examine just how much customers may end up paying resulted. AFP’s mailer points to one specific study from a firm called Energy Ventures Analysis. That study said that by 2020, the average Floridian’s annual gas and electric bills could potentially go up by a combined $464 from what they were in 2012. AFP rounded that up to $500, and made the connection that since Murphy supports the plan, he wants your bill to go up. That’s already a stretch, since Murphy has little to do with the Clean Power Plan. But there’s much more to all these analyses, which make a wide range of assertions about how the plan could affect utility customers. Energy Ventures Analysis’ estimate is near the top end of the scale, but the firm told us it’s already outdated. The analysis was done on the proposed Clean Power Plan from 2014 we mentioned before. Revisions have been made to the rule since the initial proposal. A lot has happened in the energy sector since then. Gas prices have dropped, utility rates have changed, electricity demand has largely decreased, and solar and wind energy is in wider use today, among other factors. ""If they (AFP) are linking it to our website, that’s from some time ago, during the original proposal, and that has now changed,"" Energy Ventures Analysis principal Thomas Hewson told PolitiFact Florida. Because of all the factors involved, predictions on how the plan would affect utility rates are in constant flux, he said. Hewson added that the company had since revisited the Clean Power Plan in a 2015 report for the National Mining Association. Energy Ventures Analysis hasn’t re-evaluated utility rates on a state-by-state basis, Hewson said. The National Mining Association study was about wholesale electricity prices, although it did say those would go up in Florida. Their estimates are on the high end of how much the Clean Power Plan would cost and have been attacked by groups that favor renewable energy. The Natural Resources Defense Council called Energy Ventures Analysis, which has some ties to the coal industry, a ""fossil industry mouthpiece."" Few other studies look at the specific impact on individual states, although most say the plan’s results largely depend on how utilities in individual states supply their power and charge their customers. Those decisions are usually made on a state level, and can drastically change how the Clean Power Plan’s standards come into play. Some of the rosier reports are the complete opposite of the Energy Venture Analysis study. The group Advanced Energy Economy predicted there will be no real change to energy prices at all in Florida. The EPA’s own analysis predicted that the plan will eventually result in electricity prices going down, although most groups predict a modest increase. ""Our modeling shows average annual changes in Florida retail prices of less than 1 percent between the baseline and the policy,"" said Dallas Burtraw, senior fellow at Resources for the Future, a think tank that tracks energy policy. ""Our results are consistent with those from the Bipartisan Policy Center and the Nicholas Institute (at Duke University)."" Our ruling Americans For Prosperity Florida said, ""Patrick Murphy’s ‘Pay More’ energy agenda means you could pay another $500 a year for your utility bills!"" The group is attempting to link Murphy’s support for the Clean Power Plan to the possibility of higher gas and electric rates for consumers. But Murphy has no control over the rule, and the study AFP cited is disputed and outdated. Economic impacts of the Clean Power Plan, which is currently on hold by order of the U.S. Supreme Court, are a hotly debated subject with no clear result",Mostly False,"September 20, 2016"
"North Carolina’s coast ""is possibly the best place in (the) U.S. for an offshore windfarm.""","Some lawmakers want to ban wind turbines from much of North Carolina’s soil, citing concerns about interference with the flight paths of military and civilian aircraft. The N.C. Senate approved regulations in June to do just that. The House of Representatives didn’t vote on the regulations. But regardless of whether they are revived and become law in future legislative sessions, some Democrats are already touting opportunities for wind power that aren’t on land. ""NC's coast is possibly the best place in U.S. for an offshore windfarm,"" Rep. Duane Hall of Raleigh tweeted in August, responding to news of an offshore wind farm being built in Rhode Island. ""We need to do this!"" Beachgoers tend to hate the winds that stir up sand and send umbrellas tumbling away. But we wondered whether the energy industry views windy days at the North Carolina coast differently, or whether Hall’s claim was nothing but hot air. Energy potential First, we need to ask whether Hall’s claim is even relevant. It wouldn’t matter how good North Carolina’s potential for offshore wind power is compared with the rest of the country if no one is seriously interested in offshore wind power. Even though it’s a new industry in the U.S., it makes sense for wind power advocates to focus offshore. Winds tend to be stronger and more uniform over water than over land. Several offshore wind farms are in various stages of development, and the federal government wants 20 percent of the country’s power to come from wind by 2030. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, ""offshore wind is a crucial renewable resource to be incorporated in the country's clean energy mix"" because 80 percent of energy use is in coastal states. The federal Bureau of Ocean Energy management has identified three developable sites off the North Carolina coast that contain up to 3,740 megawatts of wind energy potential. That’s nearly twice as much as the solar energy North Carolina produced in 2015, when it ranked third in the nation in solar output. So the potential is there. But is it the best? The best states for wind Hall didn’t respond to our questions asking for evidence backing up his claim. So we looked up various maps and charts on our own, trying to find ""possibly the best place"" for offshore wind energy. A 2010 study by the federal government’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory measured offshore wind power potential in each state. North Carolina ranked fifth behind Hawaii, California, Michigan and Louisiana. Here's a map from the lab:  The study measured total wind power and did not factor how much space would be realistically unusable due to developmental or environmental issues. But taking reality into consideration, Cristina Archer, a University of Delaware professor who studies renewable energy, said North Carolina is ""a pretty awesome state for offshore wind."" While it doesn’t have the most total wind or the highest wind speeds, she said, North Carolina might have the best actual potential due to the geography of the coast. ""I would agree that it is possibly the best in the country, because of the ideal combination of high winds, relatively shallow waters, and a long coastline,"" Archer said. ""Other states, like California, might have higher winds, but the waters are too deep. Or Massachusetts is windier and shallow too, but it does not have the long coastline."" The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management agrees: ""Wind speeds off the Atlantic Coast and in the Gulf of Mexico are lower than wind speeds off the Pacific Coast. However, the presence of shallower waters in the Atlantic makes development more attractive and economical for now."" Factors against North Carolina There are a few reasons why North Carolina might be passed over, however. While North Carolina has more total offshore wind potential than any other East Coast state, some spots in New England have stronger winds. Hurricanes could also scare off some companies. Turbines can only handle winds up to certain strengths, and very fast winds can damage or destroy them. A 2012 study of the risk of hurricane damage in four counties with appealing offshore wind prospects – one each in North Carolina, Texas, New Jersey and Massachusetts – found that the second-riskiest was Dare County, in northeastern North Carolina. The silver lining is that most of the risk in Dare County would be from category 4 and 5 hurricanes. No storm that strong has hit Dare County since at least 1851, when hurricane tracking began. North Carolina as a whole has experienced only one storm that strong – Hurricane Hazel, with category 4 winds, hit southern North Carolina in 1954. Ocean auctions None of the pros or cons matter, however, if companies can’t access the swaths of ocean where they want to build wind farms. The only way to get that access is to lease it from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management at auction. The BOEM has identified three areas in North Carolina for auction – one in Dare County, near Kitty Hawk, and two near Wilmington. The only other such sites in the U.S. are in New York, South Carolina, Hawaii and Oregon. A BOEM spokeswoman said the two Wilmington areas won’t be put up for auction for some time, since they’re being combined with the South Carolina areas. The Kitty Hawk site could be auctioned next year. Our ruling Hall said North Carolina’s coast is ""possibly the best place"" in the country for offshore wind. We appreciate Hall’s use of the word ""possibly."" He’s right to acknowledge some uncertainty. North Carolina has neither the country’s best individual spots for wind power nor the most total potential. But it’s near the top and further benefits from a uniquely long, shallow and uniformly windy coastline that gives it competitive advantages",Mostly True,"September 9, 2016"
"""The climate hasn't warmed in quite a few years. That is proven scientifically.""","On a Wisconsin radio talk show on Aug. 1, 2016, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson was asked about global warming. ""Listen, man can affect the environment; no doubt about it,"" Johnson replied. ""We all want a clean environment. It's a goal we all share. I understand that."" Then the Republican incumbent, who faces Democrat Russ Feingold in the November 2016 election, made a statement we want to check, saying: ""First of all, the climate hasn't warmed in quite a few years. That is proven scientifically."" Johnson’s comments on WRJN-AM in Racine prompted stories in the national media, including Talking Points Memo, Slate and the Huffington Post, each of which referred to 2015 being the hottest year on record. The rate of global warming has slowed in recent years, particularly since 1998, but Johnson’s declaration is, well, overheated. Johnson’s evidence To back Johnson’s statement, his campaign pointed us to a global ""temperature anomaly"" chart from NASA. A temperature anomaly means a change, up or down, from a long-term average.  Source: NASA 
Johnson’s campaign argued that the chart shows the anomalies rose sharply from the 1950s to the 1990s, then leveled off. The trend on the chart, however, is steadily upward since the 1960s. And there was a ""positive anomaly"" in each of the past four years. Past fact checks Previous fact checks have found global temperatures hitting record highs in recent years. In 2013, when President Barack Obama said that ""the 12 hottest years on record have come in the last 15 years,"" PolitiFact National’s rating was True. And in 2014 and 2015, our colleagues rated Mostly False two claims that there had been no global warming in the past 17 years. Global surface temperatures remained relatively flat during that period, since the last powerful El Niño, in 1998. But the first decade of the 21st century -- even as it’s been relatively stable -- has been the warmest on record. NASA/NOAA In January 2016, NASA reported that separate, independent analyses by its own scientists and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found that Earth’s 2015 surface temperatures were the warmest since modern record keeping began in 1880. The globally-averaged temperatures in 2015 ""shattered the previous mark set in 2014,"" NASA said.

The 2015 temperatures, NASA added, ""continue a long-term warming trend"" -- most of the warming has occurred in the past 35 years, with 15 of the 16 warmest years on record occurring since 2001 (as is shown in the chart below).  Source: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration So, the warmest year on record was 2015, followed by 2014. Moreover, Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist National Center for Atmospheric Research, told us that temperatures in the first six months of 2016 are even higher. Our rating Johnson said: ""The climate hasn't warmed in quite a few years. That is proven scientifically."" He argues that temperatures rose sharply from the 1950s to the 1990s, then leveled off, but it’s wrong to say there hasn’t been warming in many years. In fact, 15 of the 16 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001, with the two highest years being 2014 and 2015",False,"August 12, 2016"
"""The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs.""","During an economic address at the Detroit Economic Club, Donald Trump tailored some of his statistics to the local audience. ""As a result of recent Obama EPA actions, coal-fired plants across Michigan have either shut down entirely or undergone expensive conversions, making them non-competitive in many cases,"" Trump said. ""The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs."" Trump has often criticized efforts by the Obama administration -- and those who find climate change to be a serious concern -- to wean the United States from fossil fuels by tightening federal environmental regulation of coal-fired power plants. Here, we’ll take a look at the second part of Trump’s statement: ""The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs."" This assertion initially caught our eye because we’d never thought of Michigan as one of the premier coal-producing states. Our suspicion was correct: According to the National Mining Association, Michigan is not on the list of 26 states that currently produce any amount of coal. Meanwhile, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of workers engaged in any type of mining in Michigan over the last decade has varied between 5,000 and 7,000, making it essentially impossible to have lost 50,000 existing jobs in that sector. And as the Washington Examiner has noted, Michigan has fewer than 20,000 people working in the electricity generation sector today. So the scale of the job losses Trump cites seem, at least at first blush, to be unlikely. So what was Trump trying to say? The prepared version of his speech includes a footnote that points to a news release from the National Mining Association published almost five years ago, on Sept. 7, 2011. Here are some excerpts from that news release, which criticized ""Beyond Coal,"" a campaign against coal-fired power plants coordinated by the environmental group the Sierra Club and cited a study the group released: ""The destructive impact of the ‘Beyond Coal’ campaign is most clearly evident in the following 10 states where power plants blocked by the club represent the highest number of potential jobs (construction and permanent) foregone: Illinois (126,612), Texas (122,065), Montana (114,102), Nevada (75,194), Florida (75,055), Ohio (70,371), Colorado (55,620), Michigan (53,587), Oklahoma (42,581) and Kentucky (38,824)."" In response to an inquiry from PolitiFact, Andrew Wheeler, an energy adviser to the Trump campaign, also pointed to a U.S. Chamber of Commerce analysis that found that 10 delayed or canceled projects in Michigan -- most of them coal-fired plants -- would have created 56,000 jobs up front had they been built. Between the 53,000 jobs cited by the National Mining Association and the 56,000 jobs cited by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Wheeler said, ""it is obvious that the ‘over 50,000 jobs’ cited by Mr. Trump is accurate."" But just because a campaign is able to footnote a specific number doesn’t mean that the number is meaningful, or as fully contextualized as it ought to be. Here are a few important things to know about this number. • The number refers to ""potential"" jobs lost, not actual jobs lost. This is an important point that would not be obvious from the way Trump phrased his statement. By leaving the impression that these were actual jobs lost, Trump’s statistic invites a degree of outrage that isn’t warranted. And there are good reasons to be cautious about future job projections, especially when they have been framed so broadly as to include vendors to the industry, rail transport, ports and machinery manufacturers. Any job projections of this sort are subject to rosy estimates -- especially if a group has a vested interest in the issue. In making an argument to the public, all groups will put forward their most favorable case. Trey Pollard, the national press secretary for the Sierra Club -- which has its own dog in the fight -- said the number of plants being counted by the mining association are essentially ""the coal industry’s wildest dreams"" -- a reflection of circumstances in which they can build coal plants ""in any community they want to."" • The number doesn’t reflect that coal is increasingly being replaced by natural gas. Trump’s decision to use this number tells only part of the story of how the electricity sector has been developing. In recent years, according to federal statistics, coal has been losing ground to natural gas and, to a lesser extent, renewable energy when it comes to electricity generation. A July 2016 analysis by Sam Evans of the School of Business and Economics at King University in Bristol, Tenn., found that environmental regulation has been a factor in this switch, but a ""secondary"" one. ""The recent decline in the generation share of coal, and the concurrent rise in the share of natural gas, was mainly a market-driven response to lower natural gas prices that have made natural gas generation more economically attractive,"" Evans wrote. • This isn’t just about Obama or Clinton. Trump ignores that much of the impetus in Michigan for switching away from coal has come from the state’s Republican governor, Rick Snyder, and from utilities themselves. Snyder has generally continued his support for steps to shift away from coal that began under his Democratic predecessor as governor, Jennifer Granholm. In 2015, Snyder said at an energy conference that ""now is the time to look at a long-term transition away from coal,"" adding that because of the state’s natural gas infrastructure, ""we're well positioned to actually have a fair amount of that coal demand go to natural gas."" And Gerry Anderson, the chairman and CEO of DTE Energy, an electric utility that serves more than 2 million customers in the state, has written that ""we plan to retire older, less efficient coal plants and build new, cleaner natural gas power plants over the next decade."" Our ruling Trump said that ""the Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs."" However, this claim is problematic on several levels. While the number matches one projection of how many potential jobs could be lost from the blockage of coal-fired plants, there’s a difference between actual jobs lost and potential future jobs lost. And the number cited -- an impossible-to-confirm projection based on broadly construed calculations released by a pro-coal group -- should be taken with a big grain of salt. Trump also ignores that market forces, not just environmental regulations, have driven many of the job losses in the coal sector, and he also ignores that Michigan Republican officials and utilities themselves -- not just the Obama administration -- have pushed the switch away from coal",False,"August 9, 2016"
"""The mosquito population in South Florida is larger than it is in many other communities in the country.""","The Zika outbreak in Miami has pointed out what Floridians and vacationers have known for years: There is no shortage of mosquitoes in the Sunshine State. White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters at an Aug. 3 briefing that the region’s experience in fighting the bloodsucking insects will help efforts to prevent the further spread of the virus. At last count, the state had 338 travel-related cases of Zika, but there have been at least 15 locally transmitted instances — 13 in Miami and two in Broward County. ""We know the mosquito population in South Florida is larger than it is in many other communities in the country,"" Earnest said. He added that prior experience dealing with other mosquito-borne diseases has established the expertise for how to deal with outbreaks like this one. As anyone who has ever attended an outdoor concert or Little League game can confirm, Florida sure does have a lot of winged menaces. But do we really have more than most other communities? PolitiFact Florida didn’t have to go camping in July to quickly learn that the answer is unequivocally yes, for many reasons. A vacation for vectors Zika is a virus named after the Zika Forest in Uganda, where it was first discovered in 1947. Several cases were documented in Africa and Asia over the decades until the disease made it to a couple of Pacific island nations in 2007 and 2013. The current pandemic took off in May 2015, when Brazil reported cases of Zika in connection with an increase in babies being born with abnormally small heads, a condition called microcephaly. With evidence that the disease can be spread both through sexual contact and via mosquito bites, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there are more than 50 countries and territories with active Zika transmissions. The World Health Organization provides periodic updates of cases, and has tracked hundreds of thousands of confirmed and suspected infections in the Americas. Symptoms of the virus include fever, rash, joint pain and headaches or muscle pain, although almost four out of five infected people don’t show symptoms. There is no treatment or vaccine for the disease, so focus has been on prevention. The CDC has issued a travel warning for pregnant women and their partners to not travel to Wynwood, the neighborhood north of downtown Miami where the new cases appeared. About those mosquitoes A main culprit for the spread of the disease is mosquitoes, especially a species called Aedes aegypti. It is known for carrying tropical maladies like yellow and dengue fevers. Aegypti is not a fan of cold, northern winters. It lives across the southern United States, where it can generally survive all year long. That means the insect is just as fond of Florida as the snowbirds and sunbelters it feasts upon. The White House did not specify to us whether Earnest meant Florida had the most mosquitoes or the most different kinds of mosquitoes, but experts told us that’s largely irrelevant. What Earnest said is that the mosquito population in South Florida is larger than many other places in the United States, and that’s undoubtedly correct. The Sunshine State is a veritable mosquito encyclopedia, with about 80 species found here. American Mosquito Control Association technical adviser Joe Conlon, a retired Navy entomologist, pointed out Texas has 85 species, but ""when you’re talking about 80 versus 85, it doesn’t matter; it’s a lot."" Exactly how many individual mosquitoes are in any one place is an uncountable number. There’s no way to take a comprehensive mosquito census, although there are ways to get a rough idea. Various traps can count eggs and larvae in standing water, or the number and species of captured adult mosquitoes and extrapolate from there. Florida’s 61 mosquito control programs regularly conduct such surveys to determine if they need to spray or raise public awareness about preventing mosquito populations from growing. Of course, aegypti is an especially sneaky species that is notoriously difficult to count, Conlon said. Individuals can breed in multiple places, and adults tend to avoid traps. (Note: Only female mosquitoes bite.) If you’re wondering whether Florida is the most popular home for the particular aegypti species, there’s just no way to know that. New Orleans, for example, historically has more aegypti in terms of sheer numbers. That city and Memphis, Tenn., have experienced major mosquito-borne outbreaks in the past. That’s because mosquitoes flourish in hot climates with lots of standing water. Florida’s heat, humidity, rainfall and topography combine to make the state a garden spot for more than just New Yorkers escaping state income taxes. With salt marshes, the Everglades and plenty of man-made pools of water, South Florida faces an even bigger threat. ""Indeed, they have some of the worst mosquito problems on Earth there,"" Conlon said. Even if there were a way to take a comprehensive count of mosquitoes in an area, that number would never remain constant. ""Mosquito populations fluctuate over time and at any given point in time the mosquito population in Newburyport, Mass., may be greater than that in North Miami,"" University of Florida Entomologist Jonathan Day, of the Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory in Vero Beach, told us in an email. ""However, over the long run (for example, an entire year), South Florida mosquito populations are likely consistently higher than those observed in other communities in the country."" Our ruling Earnest said, ""The mosquito population in South Florida is larger than it is in many other communities in the country."" There’s little doubt about that. Mosquito populations can go up or down anywhere, but experts said the conditions in South Florida sustain a large and diverse collection of the insects essentially all year long.

"Says Debbie Wasserman Schultz ""has voted for huge subsidies for the sugar industry ... as well as for delays in cleanups.""","A nasty-looking toxic algae bloom on Florida’s coasts has oozed into political races, including U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s Democratic primary. Her opponent, Tim Canova, toured the mucky scene in Stuart wearing a surgical mask. He says that Wasserman Schultz shares in the blame for the algae that extends from Lake Okeechobee to Florida coastlines on the Treasure Coast and west coast. Canova said Wasserman Schultz, who represents South Florida, has sided with the main polluters of the water that flows into the Everglades: the sugar industry. Wasserman Schultz doesn’t ""want us to know that she has voted for huge subsidies for the sugar industry and other agribusinesses, as well as for delays in cleanups, while failing to deliver federal funds for any real solution,"" he said on Medium July 9. Wasserman Schultz defended her environmental record to the Sun Sentinel, concluding, ""I will continue to walk the walk on fighting to restore our precious River of Grass while my opponent just continues to talk."" Time for PolitiFact Florida to weigh in. Algae and Big Sugar Everybody agrees that the algae is bad for the environment and business. But they disagree on who is to blame. Pollution from fertilizer, manure and septic waste from suburbs and farms poured into Lake Okeechobee. That pollution stimulated the growth of algae, so when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released water from the lake to avoid a breach of the surrounding dike, the algae-ridden water traveled to other waters in Florida. Some politicians blame the federal government for the water release as well as its failure to raise the dike. Others blame the state of Florida for siding with the sugar industry and resisting calls to redirect water through sugar land. In Florida, Big Sugar has given generously to state and local politicians and to federal candidates, including Wasserman Schultz. ""The sugar industry is completely ambidextrous as far as its ability to penetrate the Republican and Democratic camps,"" said Charles Lee, director of advocacy for Audubon Florida. Everglades delay vote Canova’s campaign points to Wasserman Schultz’s vote in the state Senate to delay Everglades cleanup and to votes on two farm bills while in Congress. In 2003, then state Sen. Wasserman Schultz voted to delay for seven years the requirement for sugar companies to clean up polluted discharges that had hurt the Everglades. It passed the state Senate 38-0 and the House 96-18, and Gov. Jeb Bush signed it into law. The well-financed sugar industry fought for the delay, while environmental groups opposed it. Two days later, Wasserman Schultz changed her vote to ""no"" because she said she was ""betrayed and misled"" about the facts. The Senate passed amendments that they believed were offered by the U.S. Justice Department but had actually been written by state environmental officials. Changing a vote is ceremonial only and carries zero practical effect -- except public relations. Ryan Banfill, Wasserman Schultz’s spokesman, said that she initially supported the bill because it included a provision to buy sugar lands for filtration and was better than a 20-year-delay alternative. Sugar votes in Congress Canova’s campaign also says Wasserman Schultz supported the sugar industry because of her votes to renew the 1981 Farm Bill in 2008 and 2014. The legislation is a sweeping bill that funds an array of nutrition and agriculture programs for multiple years. So if Wasserman Schultz voted against the farm bill, she would have also voted against food stamps, assistance to food banks and economic development programs in rural areas such as providing broadband internet service. But if Wasserman Schultz had opposed the sugar portion of the bills she could have said so and she didn’t, Canova’s campaign said. The farm bill gives lucrative benefits to the sugar industry. Specifically, it gives loans to processors and limits sugar imports to the United States. The government can also buy the surplus sugar and sell it for ethanol production. These benefits amount to market controls that reduce the supply of sugar, thus making it more expensive, said Josh Sewell, a policy analyst at Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that is critical of the sugar policy. The industry disagrees with the term ""subsidy."" ""A direct subsidy -- a check -- we do not get that,"" said Ryan Weston, executive vice president of the Florida Sugarcane League. But Sewell said the price controls, marketing allotments and limits on imports are all government manipulations designed to provide an economic benefit to a set group and function as subsidies. ""Any governmental action that reduces the cost of doing business or increases prices beyond the normal functioning of a free market is a subsidy,"" he said. ""In this case consumers, food manufacturers, and sugar producers outside of the United States are on the losing end."" The industry argues it needs the aid to compete globally with other countries that subsidize sugar and that the aid helps save jobs. Critics, including candy companies and consumer watchdogs, argue that it drives up prices for consumers and amounts to corporate welfare. In recent years, there have been several national proposals by Democrats and Republicans to change the sugar program, but votes are rare. In June 2013, however, the House and Senate voted on sugar amendments that would have scaled back the industry’s benefits. The amendments failed in both chambers with Wasserman Schultz voting ""no."" Most of the Florida delegation voted against the amendment, including both of Florida’s senators Marco Rubio, a Republican, and Bill Nelson, a Democrat. Banfill said Wasserman Schultz voted against the amendment because she said it would keep the market stable, protect American jobs and maintain the program allowing the government to buy and then sell surplus sugar to ethanol producers. Lee, of Audubon Florida, says Wasserman Schultz isn’t alone in her support of the federal government’s sugar policy: ""The same attack could be applied to virtually every member of Congress from Florida and it could be applied to virtually every member of the Legislature."" Banfill pointed to other efforts by Wasserman Schultz to clean up the Everglades and her 92 percent lifetime rating from the League of Conservation Voters. She has supported a clean water rule proposed by the EPA and helped get the authorization included in the budget for multiple segments of the Tamiami Trail to restore natural water flow to part of the Everglades. She is one of many cosponsors of the Central Everglades Planning Project that includes restoration projects but hasn’t received a vote yet. Those are all steps that could help the Everglades and the environment, but the sugar industry’s benefits from the government remain in place. ""Yes, these positions were important and significant,"" Lee said. ""However, these positions did not really challenge the sugar industry. On core issues for ‘big sugar’ they have her support."" This is no different from every other major political leader in Florida, he added. Our ruling Canova said Wasserman Schultz ""has voted for huge subsidies for the sugar industry ... as well as for delays in cleanups."" In 2003, while in the state Senate, Wasserman Schultz was part of a unanimous vote for a seven-year delay to clean up the Everglades. Canova omits that two days later she changed her vote, but the vote had no practical effect and the measure passed anyway. Canova also said Wasserman Schultz voted to subsidize the sugar industry when she voted for the farm bill in 2008 and 2014. The farm bills didn’t contain actual cash subsidies, but they clearly contained lucrative benefits for the industry. The farm bill is a sweeping bill that benefits a long list of programs -- not just sugar. Wasserman Schultz has taken other steps to support Everglades cleanup. But Canova’s point about her specific actions is largely accurate",Mostly True,"July 25, 2016"
"""(Koch Industries) is among the worst in toxic air pollution in the entire United States ... and churns out more climate-changing greenhouse gases than oil giants Chevron, Shell and Valero.""","Charles and David Koch might be two of the people happiest about Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid’s impending retirement. The Nevada Democrat’s undisguised disdain for the billionaire brothers’ bankrolling of conservative groups is well-documented, and Reid’s long crusade against the Kochs isn’t letting up as he nears retirement. Kicking off a coordinated effort to draw attention towards conservative-leaning nonprofits and climate change skeptics, Reid zeroed in on the Kochs and accused them of being worse polluters than major oil companies. ""The company is among the worst in toxic air pollution in the entire United States,"" he said during a July 11 floor speech. ""Koch Industries churns out more climate-changing greenhouse gases than oil giants Chevron, Shell and Valero."" This isn’t the first time Reid has tried to connect the Kochs’ business operations with climate change, but we were curious to see which company has the worst environmental record. Measuring pollution Reached by email, a Reid spokesperson cited a 2014 Rolling Stone article detailing the history behind the Koch family’s ""Toxic Empire,"" particularly a line stating ""Koch's climate pollution ... outpaces oil giants including Valero, Chevron and Shell."" Rolling Stone cites a corporate polluter study published by the University of Massachusetts, Amherst’s Political Economy Research Institute. The ""Greenhouse 100 Polluters Index"" ranks Koch Industries 22nd on its list of polluters, creating more than 28 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions in 2014. The survey puts them ahead of the oil companies mentioned by Reid — Chevron (32nd), Royal Dutch Shell (27th) and Valero (26th) all produced fewer emissions in 2014 than Koch Industries, according to the report. Pretty clear, right? Koch Industries spokesman Ken Spain says Reid makes an unfair comparison between Koch and companies in essentially different industries with fewer facilities. ""It is misleading to compare Koch Industries — one of the largest and diversified manufacturers in the US — to much smaller companies,"" he said in a statement. ""Koch operates more than 200 manufacturing sites that employ 60,000 people in the U.S. Therefore, it is only logical that our GHG emissions are greater than a company that has far fewer facilities."" Koch lands somewhere in the middle compared to the oil giants mentioned by Reid in terms of total revenue and employees, though they do own more facilities than the other three.  Spain does have a point that Koch is more involved in manufacturing and refining goods that actually extracting and selling fossil fuels. The corporation is ranked 13th on the ""Toxic 100 Air Polluters"" list due to the roughly 31 million pounds of toxic air releases reported by the facilities owned by the Kochs. But Koch Industries does have many more facilities than Shell, Chevron and Valero. Koch Industries’ sites actually emits millions more toxic air releases than the 12 companies ahead of them on the list, such as top polluters Dow Chemical and ExxonMobil. But the company ranks lower than those because the survey adjusts the rankings to include levels of toxicity in the pollution, not just the total amount. Still, out-ranking just 12 companies isn’t exactly an environmental badge of honor. The corporation has a long history of violating environmental rules. In 2000, the company was fined a record $30 million due to repeated violations of environmental law, including more than 300 oil spills in six states. Koch Petroleum and other major polluters also reached an accord with the EPA that same year over air pollution, agreeing to spend $80 million to reduce refinery emissions and pay a $4.5 million penalty in return for a ""clean slate"" from the EPA. Invista, a Koch-owned subsidy, agreed in 2009 to a $1.7 million penalty and promised to spend up to $500 million to fix more than 680 self-reported violations of EPA standards at 12 facilities owned by the subsidy. PolitiFact also rated Charles Koch’s comments about the corporation being a ""model for other companies"" in terms of environmental regulation Mostly False, largely due to the numerous environmental crimes committed by the company throughout the late ‘90s and early 2000s. But Koch appears to be turning the corner. Rolling Stone acknowledges that the company has improved its regulatory compliance over time, which in the words of Charles Koch required a ""monumental undertaking to integrate compliance into every aspect of the company."" In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, Koch environmental director Sheryl Corrigan said the company had reduced air emissions at its refineries by 76 percent since 1997. They’ve also downsized their oil pipeline business from a high of 37,000 miles of pipeline in the late 1990s to around 4,000. Spain also pointed out a 2014 EPA Toxics Release Inventory analysis, which tracks U.S. facilities that manage and release toxic chemicals. Koch-owned businesses managed 667 million pounds of production-related waste in 2014, but the company reported implementing 240 ""Source Reduction Activities"" over the same time period — more than Shell and Chevron (though the corporation listed many more facilities than the oil giants). Our ruling Reid said, ""Koch Industries churns out more climate-changing greenhouse gases than oil giants Chevron, Shell and Valero."" Reid’s claim accurately calls on facts established in a well-respected study of corporate pollution. Koch Industries does produce more greenhouse gas emissions than the oil companies listed by Reid. But it's a somewhat misleading, apples-to-oranges comparison, because there are more Koch facilities that cover more industries compared to the oil companies. The statement is accurate but needs additional information",True,"July 19, 2016"
"""John Faso took money from fossil fuel companies as they tried to take your land by eminent domain for a fracked gas pipeline.""","Zephyr Teachout came out swinging against Republican John Faso after winning the 19th Congressional District’s Democratic primary. During a speech to supporters in Kingston on primary night, Teachout focused on Faso’s role in a controversial natural gas pipeline project. ""I stood with you against fossil fuel lobbyists, and together we protected our water and our land against fracking,"" Teachout said. ""And John Faso took money from fossil fuel companies as they tried to take your land by eminent domain for a fracked gas pipeline."" High-volume hydraulic fracturing, better known as fracking, emerged as a huge issue in upstate New York, particularly in the Southern Tier where the 19th Congressional District stretches. Was Teachout right about Faso taking money from fossil fuel companies that planned to use eminent domain? Faso’s background John Faso left his post as Assembly minority leader to run for state comptroller in 2002. He lost that election. He unsuccessfully ran for governor as the Republican nominee in 2006. After his failed comptroller bid, Faso worked for the Albany lobbying and consultant firm Manatt, Phelps & Phillips. In 2014 he left to start his own firm. He worked as a public affairs consultant for the Constitution Pipeline project until 2015. That project was called off earlier this year. The pipeline would have run through parts of the congressional district Faso now seeks to represent. The Constitution Pipeline Co. paid Faso for his work on behalf of the Constitution Pipeline project. The project The proposed pipeline would have transported natural gas from Pennsylvania - which allows fracking - through New York State - which has banned fracking. The pipeline would have transported gas extracted from fracking. So that part of Teachout’s statement checks out. The company that proposed the project pointed to the estimated economic benefits for local communities. Aside from the tax revenue, municipalities would have had the option to tap into the pipeline to supply natural gas to local residents.  Environmental advocates argued against the pipeline by warning about its potential impact on the state’s infrastructure and environment. They were also concerned for the safety of residents who would have lived near the pipeline. The pipeline had to be approved by the state and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Homeowners would have received compensation if the pipeline crossed their land. If they had not come to an agreement with the company, the resident’s land could have possibly been used anyway through eminent domain with compensation set by a court. The title of the property would still belong to the owner. The state has blocked the pipeline, but the company has appealed the decision. Faso’s role Faso’s campaign says he worked with the company as a public outreach consultant for three years from 2012 to 2015. In that role, he was a liaison to communities that would have been affected by the Constitution Pipeline project. Part of his role was to speak at public meetings about the project. Faso did not lobby lawmakers and regulators on behalf of the project. He only handled relations between the company and the public. No one would have lost land had the project gone forward. The company would have paid residents to use their land, but the title would have remained in their name. A call to the Constitution Pipeline company was not returned. Our ruling Zephyr Teachout claimed that John Faso ""took"" money from fossil fuel companies while they were trying to use eminent domain to build a pipeline on the properties of residents in the 19th Congressional District. He was paid for his work with the company, but landowners would still hold the title to their property if the company used it for the pipeline",Half True,"July 18, 2016"
"""When he served as governor, Schwarzenegger preserved more land than any other gubernatorial administration in California’s history."""," Arnold Schwarzenegger’s achievements are many: Body builder. Movie star. Governator. Honorary Forest Ranger. Yes, he was named an Honorary Forest Ranger by the federal government. But was he California’s environmental champion, its greenest governor in history, in terms of protecting the state’s natural beauty through land conservation? That’s what a top official with the USC Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy, Bonnie Reiss, claimed in a recent opinion column. ""When he served as governor, Schwarzenegger preserved more land than any other gubernatorial administration in California’s history,"" Reiss, the institute’s global director, wrote in the Malibu Times on June 8, 2016. She continued: ""He established the Sierra Nevada Conservancy that oversees more than 25 million acres of land in Northern California, reached an agreement to preserve Hearst Ranch with its 13 miles of pristine coastline in Central California and brokered the Tejon Ranch Conservation Agreement that permanently preserved 90 percent of the 270,000-acre ranch in Southern California."" Schwarzenegger’s publicist made the same claim about protecting ""more land"" than any other California governor recently on Twitter.  Reiss, who served as a senior advisor to then Gov. Schwarzenegger, also highlighted the recent completion of the National Park Service’s Backbone Trail project near Malibu, to which Schwarzenegger donated 40 acres of his personal property. On the big screen, the Hollywood icon regularly saves the day. So we decided to fact-check whether he’s saved ""more land"" than any governor ""in California’s history."" Our research Environmentalists and state officials said they are not aware of records that track land conservation by a governor. Reiss told us she knows of no official rankings. To back up her claim about Schwarzenegger, she pointed to articles by Wikipedia and an environmental nonprofit that describe the Sierra Nevada Conservancy as the largest of its kind in California and the nation. It operates across a huge swath: 25 million acres stretching from the Oregon border to Kern County. But that’s the boundary inside which land can be protected. The total acreage conserved by the agency is much less -- about 58,000 acres over the past decade, according to a conservancy spokeswoman. That is still a large patchwork of protected land. But Reiss’ emphasis on the 25 million acre boundary muddies the water. ""It’s not like they created a new park,"" said Bill Magavern, who was director of Sierra Club California at the same time Schwarzenegger was governor. ""They established a new government entity."" Schwarzenegger did not originate plans for the conservancy -- he signed a bill into law in 2004 creating it. The state agency administers grants to local governments and trusts seeking to preserve land. Also in response to our questions, Reiss pointed to the conservation of Hearst Ranch along the Central Coast and Tejon Ranch north of Los Angeles, two mammoth conservation deals, both completed during Schwarzenegger’s tenure. Those protected 80,000 acres and 240,000 acres, respectively, according to websites for each. Environmentalists say Schwarzenegger deserves credit, not as the architect of the deals, but as a significant player in both. The Tejon Ranch Company describes its agreement as the largest private conservation deal in California history.  Then California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger speaks in May 2008 at Tejon Ranch. State officials we spoke with, including researchers at the California State Library, said they are not aware of any other governor whose administration protected larger collections of land. Conservation money While it’s difficult to track governors by acreage protected, there’s another way to measure their green works: Money raised for land conservation. During the early and mid-2000s, California voters approved nearly $20 billion for conservation through six bond measures. This was ""a huge influx of money,"" dwarfing amounts raised in previous decades, said Bryan Cash, who serves as deputy assistant secretary of the California Natural Resources Agency under current Gov. Jerry Brown and also worked for the agency under Gov. Schwarzenegger. Four of the bond measures were approved under Gov. Gray Davis, but later implemented by Schwarzenegger. The voter-approved bond money led to the preservation of 1.5 million acres across California from 2000 to 2011, Cash said. ""The statement,"" about Schwarzenegger protecting more land than any California governor, ""is probably true,"" Cash added. Cash said money still flows to conservation under the Brown Administration, but significantly less than in the 2000s.  The USDA named Schwarzengger an 'Honorary Forest Ranger' in 2013. Our ruling Bonnie Reiss of the USC Schwarzenegger Institute said: ""When he served as governor, Schwarzenegger preserved more land than any other gubernatorial administration in California’s history."" State officials and environmentalists agree Schwarzenegger helped protect vast tracks of California’s hills, forests and coastline. No other governor, they said, compares in this category. They also said Schwarzenegger benefitted from conservation efforts initiated before he took office, including plans for the Sierra Nevada Conservancy and state bond measures that helped fund much of the land protected under his watch. Also, Reiss’ emphasis on Schwarzenegger’s establishment of the ""25 million acre"" Sierra Nevada Conservancy needs the clarification that only a small fraction of that acreage has been preserved over the last decade",Mostly True,"July 1, 2016"
"""There are tens of thousands of homes right here in California where you turn on the faucet but you can't drink the water.""","The wisdom of using hydraulic fracking, the controversial process of squeezing oil and gas out of rock using pressured fluid, has been one of the issues that separates Democrats Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, with Sanders advocating an outright ban on the technique. Sanders repeated his opposition during a news conference in Spreckels, Calif., in Monterey County, and said it was part of a larger concern about the availability of clean water, which he characterized as ""one of the looming crises"" in the United States and around the world. ""It is not just Flint, Mich., that is struggling with clean water. It is hundred of communities all over this country,"" he said. ""There are tens of thousands of homes right here in California where you turn on the faucet, but you can't drink the water."" ""They have to bring in bottled water, and, by the way, at great expense,"" Sanders said. ""And if we do not act aggressively on fracking and other issues, this problem will only spread."" (There was a moment of confusion during Sanders' comments when someone to Sanders' left injected a comment and, based on that, Sanders said it was tens of thousands just in that county. When we contacted that other person, environmental lawyer Gary Alan Patton, he told PolitiFact that he and Sanders misunderstood each other and the ""tens of thousands"" was not a county number.) For this fact-check, we will look at whether Sanders correctly reported the scope of the problem in California as a whole. The short answer: We couldn't find any clear data. The federal Environmental Protection Agency — with a budget of over $9 billion — said it doesn't have a running tally of households or individuals in the United States or by state who can't drink their tap water. EPA referred us to California's EPA and its State Water Resources Control Board. They don't have a tally either. What the control board does have is an annual report covering 2014 with numbers that are only suggestive of the scope of the drinking water problem in California's 7,789 public water systems. It focuses on the 167 water systems in the state that have had drinking water violations. The only time it counts people is in the sections that list water systems with arsenic, nitrate and nitrite contamination. By our tally, in 2014, 168 water systems serving 158,354 residents were cited at least once for high arsenic concentration. An additional 124 systems serving 36,652 residents were cited for high concentrations of nitrate or nitrite, substances common in fertilizers. In total, those water systems serve just over 195,000 people. With an average household size of 2.58 people, that would be about 75,600 households, putting Sanders in the ""tens of thousands"" ballpark. The problem is saying a water system has been cited for violations in 2014 doesn’t mean those households don’t have drinkable tap water. Some of those violations may have since been corrected. Some of those water systems may have adjusted for the contamination. Consider contamination with arsenic, the legendary poison that, in small doses over a long period of time can cause diabetes, heart disease and cancer. The element usually comes from the erosion of natural deposits. We contacted people in two of the largest systems cited for arsenic contamination. In Arvin, Calif., the levels are so high, the 18,000 or so residents supplied by local water district are drinking bottled or filtered water provided by the city. The schools, parks and the library, for example, have their water filtered. The city is working on three new wells to try to correct the longstanding problem. Yet a few miles northwest, in Lamont, which serves a population of 18,290, people are drinking the water in spite of one well with high arsenic levels. That well is shut down, so the tap water is drinkable. Water district officials are hoping a new well will have low levels so they can blend it with the now-offline well to dilute the arsenic. ""We never had a case where people had to purchase water because it was unsafe to drink,"" said Rolando Marquez, water system supervisor. Point being, they shouldn't be included in any count to assess whether Sanders is correct. But there's another factor that makes the state report even less reliable as a gauge of how many California residents have tap water that's not safe to drink. Between 660,000 and 2 million people in the state rely on unregulated water from home wells that may also be polluted and don't have to be tested. People may be drinking it because the cost to homeowners to treat that water may be prohibitively high. The only official estimate we could find for the state was a 2013 news release from the state water board reporting that, ""More than 95 percent of California’s 38 million residents get their drinking water from a public water supply and, of that number, 98 percent are served safe drinking water, according to CDPH,"" the acronym for the California Department of Public Health. If that means 2 percent are served unsafe drinking water, that works out to about 722,000 residents or roughly 280,000 households. That's hundreds of thousands, not tens of thousands. If that estimate is correct, Sanders is low-balling the tap water pollution problem in The Golden State. When we contacted the Sanders campaign, they didn't have any hard numbers either, just media reports, including an Associated Press story about 2 million people living near groundwater containing uranium (but that's untreated water and the number goes beyond California), another AP story reporting that 57 water systems in California had too much lead in their drinking water (but no indication on how many households they served) and a story from the Visalia Times Delta saying that nearly one fifth of groundwater used for public drinking supplies is polluted (again, that's before treatment). Our ruling Sanders said, ""There are tens of thousands of homes right here in California where you turn on the faucet, but you can't drink the water."" But surprisingly, neither the federal nor state governments has a reliable tally for public water supplies, never mind private wells that are not regulated. Clearly California has a lot of polluted water, but in many cases that water can be treated or mixed with unpolluted water to bring the contaminants down to safe levels. Thus, the number of households with undrinkable tap water remains uncertain. Sanders is right about the problem but his assessment of its scope — tens of thousands of households — lacks good data",Half True,"June 14, 2016"
"Says it's not true that Florida black bears are an ""apex predator.""","A Hillsborough County commissioner who opposes declaring open season on Florida black bears said the animals aren’t the threat hunting advocates make them out to be. Stacy White, a self-proclaimed ""avid outdoorsman"" who hunts, backed a resolution to symbolically oppose a state-sanctioned bear hunt in Florida this year. The commission approved the resolution 6-0 at its June 2 meeting. The state will decide June 22 whether to allow another hunt. Some opponents of the measure had spoken in favor of a bear hunt. Phil Walters of GatorGuides.com said Hillsborough County didn’t need to pass the resolution, because the county didn’t even have a black bear population. But commissioners ran that risk if there was no bear hunt. ""Do you really want bears being brought into this county?"" Walters asked. ""If you think you’ve got problems with wildlife now, wait until you have a top apex predator in close proximity to people."" White later responded by saying Walters had mischaracterized bears as apex predators — meaning they are at the very top of the food chain. ""One of the folks that spoke during the public comment portion of the meeting called the Florida black bear a top apex predator. That is absolutely, unequivocally false,"" White said. He followed up with Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (or FWC) statistics that said a black bear’s diet ""usually consists of 80 percent plants, 15 percent insects and 5 percent animal matter."" White told PolitiFact Florida he meant apex predator in the figurative sense, to refute what he saw as Walters’ implication that bears may hunt down humans. Bears ""certainly don’t actively hunt animal prey,"" White told us. He has a point there, bear experts said, but using the term ""apex predator"" largely depends on how it’s being applied. Bear complexities Florida’s black bear population had dwindled to 300 some four decades ago before the species was protected and hunting was outlawed. In 2012, the FWC removed bears from the ""threatened"" list as their numbers rebounded. Recent estimates say there are about 4,350 bears statewide today. As more people moved into bear habitat, the state fielded thousands of complaints about them hanging out in hot tubs, swinging in hammocks and raiding garbage bins. Then, beginning in 2013, bears attacked and mauled four women. That led to a decision in 2015 to schedule the first hunt in 21 years as a way to control the population.  A 320-bear limit was set for the weeklong hunt, but the state shut it down after just two days when permitted hunters had killed 304 bears. Among the reasons bears venture into populated areas (beyond loss of habitat and increased numbers) is that bears are omnivores, and will eat just about anything they can find — including what’s in humans’ garbage cans, barbecue grills and pet-food dishes.   Their diet mostly includes berries, acorns, grasses, seeds, plant shoots, and even moss and ferns. If they do eat other animals, many times they are of the six-legged variety, such as ants, wasps and beetles. If a bear digs into a beehive, chances are they want the bees and not their honey. Bears also will eat the odd armadillo or possum, but often those are scavenged from already dead carcasses. Playing dead is not a safe way to avoid being eaten by a bear. ""Bears definitely are carnivores and predators. Whether they are a ‘top predator’ is open to one’s perspective,"" said Thomas Eason, the FWC’s director of wildlife and habitat conservation. ""That connotation is not commonly used in the scientific arena for black bears."" That leads to an interesting juxtaposition: Bears are, by the standard definition, apex predators. They’re at the top of the food chain, and practically nothing can or would even try to kill an adult bear for food. But how you use the term apex predator matters, too. ""If you are thinking about apex predators being a danger to people that they might see as food, as a polar bear might, then black bears are not a big issue,"" University of Florida wildlife biologist Bill Giuliano said. ""However, their omnivorous tendencies and ability to live in close proximity to people is a concern."" Bears don’t look to hunt people down, as the term apex predator may evoke, but events can potentially turn sour quickly if they are around people. If bears, especially a sow with cubs, get startled or cornered (perhaps by a dog you’ve let out of the house), they will try to escape. That escape route may be through you. In that case, we asked, what could kill a 300-pound adult black bear, short of hitting it with a car? ""Nothing besides a bullet,"" Giuliano said. Our ruling White said it's not true that Florida black bears are an ""apex predator."" That’s overstating the case a little bit. Experts said bears are apex predators in the sense that nothing in their ecosystem naturally hunts them for food. Bears are definitely capable of injuring or even killing someone, but they don’t normally seek out humans. Bears are omnivorous, and any interaction between hungry bears and people most often involves the bear getting caught rooting in the trash",Half True,"June 8, 2016"
"In California, ""the windmills are killing hundreds and hundreds of eagles.""","Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, says he favors energy from all sources to power America. Wind is on his list, but in remarks in Bismarck, N.D., Trump emphasized that wind turbines are not without their drawbacks. ""There are places for wind but if you go to various places in California, wind is killing all of the eagles,"" Trump said. ""You know if you shoot an eagle, if you kill an eagle, they want to put you in jail for five years. And yet the windmills are killing hundreds and hundreds of eagles. … They’re killing them by the hundreds."" Setting aside Trump’s exaggeration about killing all of the eagles, we wondered, are wind turbines in California killing ""hundreds and hundreds,"" as he said? The truth is, we lack complete data, but Shawn Smallwood, California’s leading ornithologist for the study of raptors and wind turbines, told us Trump is exaggerating. Smallwood says about 100 eagles die each year due to impacts with the spinning blades on windmills. ""Mr. Trump could not have arrived at his number (hundreds and hundreds) from any reliable source, unless he is referring to all eagles killed by industrial-scale wind turbines since they were installed in the early 1980s,"" Smallwood said. ""Cumulatively over time, there have been hundreds of eagles killed, probably about 2,000."" We reached out to the Trump campaign and did not hear back. Smallwood has worked intensively on one of the country’s first wind farms at Altamont Pass in Northern California. At one time, nearly 7,000 windmills churned out power there. But a combination of lawsuits and public pressure has cut that number by more than half. ""My best estimate for golden eagle fatalities in the Altamont Pass was 60 per year until the last couple of years when the old turbines started getting replaced by larger turbines that are being more carefully sited to reduce eagle fatalities,"" Smallwood said. Today, Smallwood said the number of eagle fatalities is much lower. Altamont Pass lies in Alameda County. Government figures show 14 golden eagles killed there in 2013. And that was two years before one of the leading operators in the wind farm announced it was shutting down over 800 turbines. By the way, bald eagle deaths appear to be rare. Also, as a species, there is less concern because their population, about 70,000, is growing, while the population of golden eagles, about 20,000, is at best holding steady and could be declining. To be sure, Smallwood said much information is missing statewide. Several facilities fail to provide regular monitoring reports, or at least, they fail to make them public. Audubon California agrees with Smallwood’s estimate. Spokesman Garrison Frost told us ""this is about as accurate as you’re going to get."" A spokesman for the American Bird Conservancy told us that they believe the number remains high. ""It is unknown how many golden eagles are being killed each year in California, but based on what we know from Altamont, it is likely that over 100 are dying each year at wind farms,"" said Steve Holmer. ""Many of these birds could be saved with proper siting and mitigation measures."" Our ruling Trump said that in California, windmills are killing hundreds and hundreds of eagles. The best estimate is that about 100 golden eagles die each year from collisions with wind turbine blades. The data are not perfect, but the people most concerned about the welfare of the eagles do not go along with Trump’s figure. While the data are sketchy, the information at hand tells us that windmills were more deadly in the past, but today, fewer turbines, new designs and better siting have reduced fatalities. Trump is correct that California wind farms are a threat to eagles but not on the magnitude he suggested. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression",Mostly False,"May 31, 2016"
"""I believe we should have tax on carbon and deal aggressively with climate change. That is not (Hillary Clinton's) position.""","Bernie Sanders still doesn’t want to talk about Hillary Clinton’s damn emails. Asked for his reaction to the State Department report of Clinton’s use of a private email server, Sanders told Meet the Press’ Chuck Todd that he’d rather talk policy differences. ""Our campaign is about defeating Secretary Clinton on the real issues,"" he responded. ""I want to break up the Wall Street banks. She doesn’t. I want to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. She wants $12 an hour. I voted against the war in Iraq. She voted for the war in Iraq. I believe we should ban fracking. She does not. I believe we should have tax on carbon and deal aggressively with climate change. That is not her position. Those are some of the issues that I am campaigning on."" Sanders is right about Clinton’s Iraq war vote and where she stands on breaking up banks, a $15 minimum wage and fracking. (For more of their policy differences, read this.) But is he also right about their differences on carbon tax and climate change? There’s no doubt that Sanders’ rhetoric on climate change and his plan to deal with it are aggressive and, unlike Clinton, he has advocated for a carbon tax. Clinton does, however, have a climate change plan. While some environmentalists have said it isn’t tough enough, others have given it positive reviews. Both the Sanders and Clinton campaigns referred us to each candidate’s climate change plan. Sanders’ plan is long and comprehensive. Beyond a tax on carbon, it includes an array of proposals from banning certain drilling and mining practices to improving the national public transit system.   Clinton’s plan is shorter and, though it doesn’t include a tax on carbon, contains similar provisions on renewables. Here’s an overview: Sanders’ plan Clinton’s plan Fossil fuel influence • Cut tax subsidies for oil and gas companies • Prohibit fossil fuel lobbyists from working in the White House • Investigate climate change deniers • Cut tax subsidies for oil and gas companies Environmental standards • Enact a tax on carbon • Ban fossil fuel leasing on public lands and promote conservation and habitat preservation • Ban Arctic oil drilling, offshore drilling, fracking, mountaintop removal coal mining and pipeline projects • Stop exports of natural gas and crude oil • Defend and close loopholes in the Clean Air Act • Increase fuel efficiency standards • Begin a moratorium on nuclear power • Create a national environmental and climate justice plan • Reform fossil fuel leasing and expand clean energy production on public lands • Defend and extend environmental standards like the Clean Power Plan • Eliminate lead poisoning, clean up brownfield sites, and create an Environmental Justice Task Force Renewables • Invest in clean energy infrastructure and modernize the energy grid • Invest in clean energy, alternative fuels and energy efficiency programs • Invest in clean energy infrastructure • Launch a $60 billion local-state-federal clean energy partnership As in her plan, Clinton prefers to focus on renewables on the stump. In a January Medium post responding to the Sanders camp, Clinton’s campaign manager highlighted her pledge to ""make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century"" in her launch speech. Clinton, who played a role in negotiating the Paris climate change agreement, herself touted her goals for more solar panel and clean electricity as ""big"" and ""bold."" Clinton has gotten her best reviews from the League of Conservation Voters, who endorsed Clinton last fall (to some controversy). The green group considers Clinton’s plan strong and aggressive and, more importantly, achievable, Tiernan Sittenfeld, its senior vice president of government affairs, told PolitiFact. ""Hillary is focused on practical solutions,"" Sittenfeld said, pointing out that there are many lawmakers in Congress who still deny climate change science. ""So (a carbon tax) is pretty remote possibility."" But some are skeptical of Clinton’s ""boldness."" Pulitzer Prize-winning website InsideClimate News called Clinton’s plan ambitious but said it ""falls short of bold."" The Washington Post’s editorial board said her ideas are ""second best."" Environmental news magazine Grist summed up her positions as not bad but ""not quite the climate hawkishness we need.""   Our ruling Sanders said, ""I believe we should have tax on carbon and deal aggressively with climate change. That is not her position."" Unlike Sanders, Clinton doesn’t advocate for a carbon tax. And while Clinton doesn’t go as far as Sanders in her climate change plan, she does have one.

"""By the time you drink your coffee, an elephant is killed for its ivory tusks.""","By the time you drink your coffee, an elephant is killed for its ivory tusks, according to an image shared by actress Minka Kelly. Kelly (Friday Night Lights) posted the statistic by the International Fund for Animal Welfare on her Instagram, along with a note urging her followers to sign IFAW’s petition asking wildlife authorities to list African elephants as endangered and give the species more protections. ""#Elephants are being killed at an alarming rate, both by #ivory poachers and by wealthy American trophy #hunters,"" Kelly wrote May 10. ""It's estimated that on average, an #elephant is killed every 15 minutes for its ivory. That's 96 animals a day!"" Is it true that elephants are killed at the rate it takes to down a cup of joe? The estimate is derived from a reputable academic study, but IFAW is oversimplifying the complexities of that research to score a good soundbite. Every 15 minutes Beth Allgood, IFAW’s director for U.S. campaigns, told us the 96 elephants figure comes from a 2014 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences study that provided the first reliable continent-wide estimate of illegal kills. The researchers used data at carcass-monitoring field sites maintained by CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) to model the Africa-wide number of illegal elephant deaths. The study determined the percentage of elephants estimated to be killed by poaching. It then took that percentage and applied it to current estimates of the total number of African elephant species total. The study used two different approaches to calculate the total number of African elephants killed over three years — reaching 99,997 in one version and 101,784 in the other. (For context, the entire species had an estimated population size of 420,000 to 650,000 in 2012.) Averaged over three years, that’s an annual rate of 33,630 elephants, researchers said. That's a daily rate of 92 elephants (not 96) or the equivalent of one elephant illegally poached every 15 to 16 minutes. We spoke to the lead author of the study, George Wittemyer of Colorado State University, about his findings and the IFAW claim. Wittemyer said the IFAW calculation was ""plausible,"" but he also said that ""confidence intervals around the numbers are a bit wide."" In other words, IFAW is taking a fairly shaky estimate and describing it as a certainty. The better take-away from the paper is the order of magnitude (tens of thousands of elephants killed per year), rather than exact figures, said Julian Blanc, the data analyst for CITES’ elephant monitoring program. ""I therefore cannot vouch for the ‘96 elephants a day’ figure,"" Blanc told us. About that coffee comparison Whether that translates to one elephant ""by the time you drink your coffee"" depends on if you sip or chug. Yes, we understand the line is a rhetorical flourish, but hey, we’re fact-checkers so we conducted an unscientific Twitter poll to gauge caffeination speeds.  Out of nearly 2,200 respondents, a third said it takes them 15 minutes to finish their java. For these coffee drinkers, that does correspond to one elephant poached by the time they’re done. But for a third of respondents who drink faster, the claim doesn’t hold up.  And for the other third who were more indolent, the claim actually lowballs the amount of elephant deaths. Ivory and elephants Various wildlife groups list demand for ivory as one of, if not the, main reason for the decimation of African elephants. But recent reports suggest poaching may be on the decline, which may push this coffee factoid further from reality. When Europeans began colonizing Africa in the 1800s, there were an estimated 26 million elephants before the world gained an appetite for their tusks. Americans consumed 200 tons of ivory — used to make combs, art, pool balls and piano keys — per year in the early part of the 20th century and the elephant population had declined to an estimated 10 million. According to the first comprehensive survey of the species conducted by zoologist Iain Douglas-Hamilton, the population had dwindled to 1.3 million in 1979 and fell to 600,000 within a decade. This poaching crisis, said Allgood of the IFAW, led CITES to ban the international ivory trade in 1989. Then the overall elephant population rebounded from just 286,000 in 1995 to 472,000 in 2007 before a resurgence of the crisis.  According to a CITES report, illegal ivory trade activity and the weight of the ivory more than doubled since 2007 as a result of rising demand from growing Asian economies. The area hardest hit has been Central African countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon, where illegal sales help fund war and terrorism. Today, the outlook looks slightly brighter for elephants as killings have declined since the peak in 2011, CITES reports. That’s important to note for two reasons. First, the Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences study cited by IFAW includes the peak year of 2011. Second, a decline in more recent years would knock down the total number of elephants poached. Furthermore, China, the world’s biggest ivory consumer, and the United States agreed to enact a complete ban on ivory in the fall of 2015. Our ruling Kelly said, ""By the time you drink your coffee, an elephant is killed for its ivory tusks."" The group behind this claim, the International Fund for Animal Welfare, is trying to draw attention to a real problem by boiling down complex research into a simple-to-use factoid. But they are testing limits of the research they’re citing. The study measured three years and estimated that about 100,000 elephants were killed by poachers in that time period. Experts caution against taking those figures -- which rely on estimates -- and boiling them down in the way IFAW did. And since that study concluded, other research suggests that poaching has declined. And, it should be obvious, but this only really matters if you take 15 minutes to drink a cup of coffee",Half True,"May 17, 2016"
"Says Katie McGinty ""actually agrees with Hillary Clinton and the most liberal wing of the Democrats on everything.""","Correction appended During a recent broadcast of Dom Giordano’s Philadelphia talk radio show on 1210AM, as Buzzfeed reported, U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., called it outrageous that Democratic nominee Katie McGinty tied him to GOP Presidential frontrunner Donald Trump. The two have wasted no time battling it out ever since McGinty won the Democratic primary April 26 to take on Toomey in the general election. As a comeback, Toomey compared McGinty’s campaign stances to those of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. ""She actually agrees with Hillary Clinton and the most liberal wing of the Democrats on everything,"" said Toomey. We reached out to Toomey’s campaign for more background. ""The only times McGinty has publicly deviated from the Obama and Clinton agenda are when she's gone even further to the left, like embracing Bernie Sanders-style single-payer healthcare and defending sanctuary cities,"" Communications Director Ted Kwong said to PolitiFact PA in an email statement. Many observers would dispute aligning Clinton with party’s most liberal faction. Nevertheless, we looked through issues backed by two candidates, and we found that Toomey’s claim doesn’t hold up entirely. Sure, there are plenty of things McGinty and Clinton agree on. Both cite a need for good-paying jobs and strengthening America’s clean energy economy — just two examples out of many. But, we haven’t found evidence to prove that Clinton and McGinty agree on each issue. Actually, we were able to find a couple on which their views don’t align. One of Clinton’s big campaign issues is that ""climate change is an urgent threat,"" and she says we need to ""invest in clean energy innovations."" McGinty has the same stance. However, when you look at fracking, McGinty’s views set her apart from much of the party. Clinton’s position has evolved some, but at present she believes fracking should only be permitted if the local residents approve. McGinty on the other hand thinks, with proper taxation and regulation, fracking should get the green light. The two democratic nominees also have had very different histories with free trade. Clinton’s position on NAFTA is complicated, to say the least. When Bill Clinton first signed the agreement into law in 1993, Hillary Clinton publicly supported it, but that support has waned over time. She most recently publicly backed NAFTA in her autobiography written in 2003 and in a teleconference that took place in 2004. Since that time, Clinton has not made public statements defending the free trade agreement. In fact, in 2008 Clinton called herself a ""critic of NAFTA from the very beginning."" In reality, Clinton’s public position on NAFTA has certainly shifted over the past few years. McGinty’s stance on NAFTA has also evolved, but her present position is much less convoluted. In a democratic debate live from the University Park campus of Penn State last month, McGinty called NAFTA ""something that hasn’t worked in 30 years."" So, it’s not the case to say that the two candidates agree on everything. It would be more accurate to say they share the vast majority of issues that they’ve endorse publicly. This is pretty common in Democratic races. In the lead-up to the primary, polling expert G. Terry Madonna told TribLive that McGinty differed little in stances from her fellow Democratic candidates, John Fetterman and Joe Sestak. ""This campaign is about personalities and style,"" Madonna said. ""On 100 issues in the Senate, these candidates would probably vote the same way on 98 of them. I don't think the issues are as defining as who these candidates are."" Richardson Dilworth, director of the Center for Public Policy at Drexel University, argued that campaign stances aren’t always directly representative of a candidate’s personal beliefs, but of the campaign’s stakeholders, of the constituencies the politician is aiming to attract. Looking beyond established platforms, two candidates can differ on more than their common planks would suggest. ""There’s a distinction between [Clinton’s] personal opinions and what she promises as a candidate. Those two things don’t have to agree. There’s no reason to expect that she’s going to have the same personal opinions as she would have about positions she publicly takes because the positions she has to take as a candidate are going to be negotiations among many stakeholders,"" Dilworth said. Dilworth thinks McGinty’s and Clinton’s strong similarities are no coincidence, though. ""Pennsylvania is, to a certain extent, representative of the country, more so than many other states,"" said Dilworth. ""In that respect, McGinty will be making a lot of the same pitches as Hillary Clinton because she’s going for the same kinds of voters."" Our ruling Senator Pat Toomey stated that Katie McGinty agrees with Hillary Clinton on everything. After closer inspection, it has become clear that although McGinty and Clinton share similar positions on many issues, there are a couple of significant instances where their opinions differ. Furthermore, many of their shared opinions can be attributed to the similarities in their intended audiences. McGinty and Clinton have expressed similar public opinions on many issues, but it wouldn’t be wholly accurate to say that they agree with each other on everything",Half True,"May 16, 2016"
"Under a new federal regulation, it will cost Pinellas County ""$31 million to fix a single ditch.""","A voter at an Orlando debate asked U.S. Reps. David Jolly and Alan Grayson whether climate change presented the greatest threat the world currently faces. That’s when Jolly steered the conversation into a ditch. The Indian Shores Republican answered that ""agents of terror"" are the greatest threat against America, but the effects of climate change are real and will need to be addressed. He said he preferred tax credits and federal money for research instead of stricter environmental and energy regulations from Washington. ""What won't work is the president's Waters of the United States regulation that's going to cost Pinellas County, just one county, between $400 million and $2.5 billion,"" Jolly said on April 25, 2016. ""It will cost them $31 million to fix a single ditch."" We wanted to know if there was a new regulation forcing Pinellas County to spend $31 million to fix a ditch. What we found out is that the price is an old estimate, and there's little consensus how the Environmental Protection Agency is actually changing the rules. Ditch debate Jolly’s campaign said his example came from a letter the business lobbying group Associated Industries of Florida sent to members of Congress on Aug. 12, 2014. The letter asked the state’s congressional delegation to support changes AIF wanted for a new rule concerning the Clean Water Act. Before we get swept up in regulatory minutiae: The original Clean Water Act was passed in 1972 after pollution issues and disasters like Cuyahoga River fire in Ohio of 1969 and Lake Thonotosassa fish kills in Florida. The legislation was supposed to regulate discharges into waterways and wetlands, but environmentalists and industry groups have long debated which bodies of water the act encompassed. U.S. Supreme Court rulings in 2001 and 2006 raised questions about the law’s reach, so the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers aimed to clarify what waters were federally protected, or ""waters of the United States"" (known as WOTUS, really). The agencies published a proposed rule change on April 21, 2014, that addressed several issues, including whether the law applied to ditches and in which circumstances. That did anything but dry up debate. Groups like the National Association of Counties and Republican attorneys general from several states flooded the EPA with objections to the rule. (Florida later joined the call for courts to review the rule.) We’re sticking to ditches for this fact-check. Opponents were concerned that if the rule reclassified a ditch as a water of the United States, county governments could be on the hook for upgrading them to meet EPA rules. In its letter to Congress, AIF said upgrades would be costly. AIF’s initial assessment was based on a ""preliminary analysis"" commissioned by the Florida Stormwater Association, a group of the state’s stormwater management officials. The analysis looked at eight waterways and the estimated cost to bring them in line with the new regulation. Among the eight examples was ""Pinellas Park Ditch #5,"" a 1.3-mile-long flood control canal known as Bonn Creek that empties into the Joe’s Creek Watershed. The ditch, with mostly concrete banks, was designed to handle stormwater runoff. The analysis said the ditch wasn’t currently under the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act, but it would be under the proposed rule change. The report estimated it would cost $31.3 million to make the ditch compliant with the Clean Water Act’s accepted phosphorous and nitrogen discharge levels. Whether any upgrades to that ditch would be that expensive — or even necessary — is still up in the air. Jon Devine, senior adviser to the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund, said the analysis Jolly cited doesn’t say why it would cost $31.3 million, and is out of date as a talking point. ""It’s based on the proposed rule, not the final rule, and the final rule took account of a lot of input — including that of municipal stormwater dischargers,"" Devine said. Critics did manage to alter the current of the discussion. After the rule was announced in April 2014, the public was invited to comment. Their concerns about ditches led to changes in the final rule, which was announced in May 2015, and published in June. Among the revisions was that ""the rule further reduces existing confusion and inconsistency regarding the regulation of ditches by explicitly excluding certain categories of ditches, such as ditches that flow only after precipitation.""   The short version: If a ditch that handles stormwater wasn’t under federal jurisdiction before, it wouldn’t be under the new rule. When we contacted AIF for comment on the revised rule, the group said they were not currently working on the issue and had nothing to add. ""The bottom line is that the final Clean Water Rule does not change, in any manner, the way stormwater systems have always been covered under the CWA and, therefore, does not result in any new costs for CWA compliance,"" EPA spokeswoman Enesta Jones told us in an email.  If the EPA doesn't require a status change, that would leave the ditch in local control. Devine noted that the EPA usually allows state agencies to decide most of their own policies. ""The states establish what criteria apply to particular waterways, based on their state-designated uses,"" he said. ""Though this is subject to EPA oversight, in my experience (the) EPA is extremely deferential to state judgments."" But EPA reassurances haven’t settled these turbulent waters. Kelli Hammer Levy, chairwoman of the Florida Stormwater Association’s legislative committee and a section manager for Pinellas County watershed management, disagreed with the EPA’s assertion. She said the rule’s reach was not yet fully known, and provisions in it would change the ditch’s status. ""Bonn Creek would be classified as a tributary in this case because it has a bed, bank and high water mark and discharges into a (water of the United States),"" Levy said in an email. Pinellas County isn’t alone in not accepting what the EPA says. Many state officials across the country still didn’t trust the parameters of the final rule, which was set to go into effect in August 2015. It has been put on hold nationally because of pending litigation from more than a dozen states. Our ruling Jolly said that under a new federal regulation, it will cost Pinellas County ""$31 million to fix a single ditch."" His figure comes from a 2014 report that claimed it would cost the county that much to make a stormwater ditch in Pinellas Park compliant with Clean Water Act pollution guidelines under a new rule. But the report didn’t specify why it would cost so much, and didn’t reflect changes the EPA made to the rule in 2015. Jolly didn’t make up the $31 million estimate, but his wording makes it sound as if the EPA is definitely forcing crippling regulatory costs on the county. The agency denies the rule change affects how ditches are classified, but the scope of the new rule is still far from settled. Debate abounds about how specific waterways would be affected by the final rule, which currently is under a court stay pending litigation. There’s no irrefutable evidence of an imminent (and expensive) federal takeover of the ditch in question",Mostly False,"May 9, 2016"

But the use of lead-based paint has been banned in the United States since 1978 because the element is a poisonous neurotoxin. It’s especially harmful to children, even at tiny levels of exposure. Could a U.S. company still be making paint containing lead? Unleaded, please The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency enforces the rules against lead-based paint. Because many pre-1978 homes and buildings still contain lead paint, the EPA also cracks down on improper renovation and demolition activity, because inadequate abatement can release lead particles into the air, soil and water.  But the executive director of Occupational Knowledge International, Perry Gottesfeld, says American firms still make paint with lead. Reports suggest that global lead production is up more than 70 percent. The petition is aimed at protecting consumers around the world -- Occupational Knowledge International says that 2.5 billion people live in countries where lead paint is still sold for residential use. Many countries don’t have regulations concerning lead in paint. A 2014 article in the National Institute of Health’s publication, Environmental Health Perspectives, charts 40 countries worldwide where decorative paint containing lead is still sold. Sherwin-Williams director of corporate communications, Mike Conway, said the company does not produce lead-based paint intended for residential use anywhere in the world. That’s accurate. But Sherwin-Williams does have 16 licensees who produce and sell Sherwin-Williams branded paint overseas, in places like Haiti, Indonesia, Thailand, El Salvador, Peru, and Guatemala. Those licensees control what’s in their product, and sign agreements that their formulas will not contain lead, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer.   And in 2015, the Plain Dealer reported that ""researchers from the University of Cincinnati and IPEN, an international non-governmental organization network, found lead at 360 times the acceptable limits in the Dutch Boy residential paint produced and sold by one of those licensees, Lebanon-based ChemiPaint."" ""We had one isolated case in Lebanon with a licensee who received a contaminated raw material from a Chinese supplier,"" Conway told PolitiFact. ""When he mixed it into the batch, that caused the lead level to rise. We responded immediately and made sure they rectified the problem. No issues since then."" Why lead in the first place If the downside is that it’s a poison, what’s the upside to using lead in paint? Tami Lasseter Clare, an associate professor of chemistry at Portland State University, said that it comes down to durability and cost. ""Paint is composed of two things, the pigment and the binder,"" Clare said. ""The pigment is the thing that gives it color and opacity, and the binder is the glue that sticks the pigment particles together."" When lead is in its basic form, lead carbonate, it is a white mineral, making it a good pigment. But other stuff is white too, like zinc oxide, the white stuff in sunscreen, or titanium dioxide. Zinc is not as good at covering and hiding surfaces, Clare said, so titanium dioxide has become the main lead alternative.   Titanium dioxide has hiding power, but the downside is its price, which fluctuates like crazy. ""Major paint companies may be motivated to move away from materials having volatile prices to give better profit predictability,"" Clare said. But litigation is costly, too. In 2014, a judge in California ordered Sherwin-Williams and two other paint manufacturers to pay $1.15 billion into a fund for lead abatement, ruling that the companies created a public nuisance by promoting the use of lead paint in homes prior to 1978, while knowing the dangers it posed. The decision contained an excerpt from a Sherwin-Williams publication from 1900 that read, ""It is also familiarly known that white lead is a deadly cumulative poison, while zinc white is innocuous. It is true, therefore, that any paint is poisonous in proportion to the percentage of lead contained in it."" The World Health Organization joined with the United Nations Environment Programme to form the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint. Its objective is ""to promote a phase-out of the manufacture and sale of paints containing lead."" Conway, Sherwin-Williams’ spokesman, told PolitiFact Ohio that the company supports the global lead alliance program to eliminate lead in paint. The lead alliance’s goal for phasing out lead is gradual, and its first priority is to convince industry partners to stop using lead in decorative and residential paints that consumers buy off the shelf. There's another wrinkle to the paint debate.  Sherwin-Williams also makes industrial coatings that are intended to be used only on outdoor metal surfaces such as cars and bridges. Sherwin-Williams does make industrial paint products that contain lead.  Conway said the practice is not only legal but can be necessary to protect against corrosion. Gottesfeld wrote in Front Public Health that there are safer alternatives available for companies like Sherwin-Williams to use. The other paint manufacturer named in the petition, PPG International, held its shareholder meeting April 21, 2016, and the company’s CEO announced plans to eliminate lead from all PPG products by 2020. Our ruling Occupational Knowledge International, a group dedicated to eliminating lead paint, posted a petition on Change.org that says Sherwin-Williams is ""making lead paint and poisoning people around the world."" There is some truth to the claim but also some spin. Sherwin-Williams continues to make industrial paint products that contain lead, but those paints are exempt from the U.S. lead ban. Sherwin-Williams does not directly make or directly sell residential paint products that contain lead, but they have licensees who might. In one case, in Lebanon, Sherwin-Williams acknowledged a mistake that allowed lead into a residential paint product. Occupational Knowledge International’s claim about Sherwin-Williams is partially accurate but leaves out important details",Half True,"April 26, 2016"
"""In last week’s debate, Bernie questioned Hillary’s commitment to fighting climate change because a whopping 0.2 percent of the money given to our campaign has come from employees of oil and gas companies. Not even 2 percent, mind you: 0.2 percent.""","In a recent post on Medium, Robby Mook -- Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager -- countered accusations from Bernie Sanders that Clinton has been tainted by taking money from oil and gas interests. ""In last week’s debate,"" Mook wrote of the April 14 Democratic presidential face-off in Brooklyn, ""Bernie questioned Hillary’s commitment to fighting climate change because a whopping 0.2 percent of the money given to our campaign has come from employees of oil and gas companies. Not even 2 percent, mind you: 0.2 percent."" We have taken a look at this general topic before but haven’t rated this particular assertion, so we’ll do it here. A look at the numbers We turned to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent clearinghouse for campaign finance data. Clinton has raised $307,561 from people employed by the oil and gas industry. It’s worth noting that not all this money comes from people with deep pockets; this total includes donations from everyone employed by the industry, from CEOs to gas-station employees. Altogether, Clinton’s campaign has raised more than $180 million, so the percentage raised from employees of the oil and gas industry works out to 0.17 percent -- which is actually a bit less than Mook said. By comparison, Sanders has raised less from oil and gas employees than Clinton has -- $53,760 -- which amounts to 0.03 percent of the $182 million his campaign has raised. In any case, this particular statistic looks solid on the math. That said, we’ll raise a caveat. Mook’s narrow focus Mook has worded the claim carefully to exclude other donations, which amounts to a bit of cherry-picking. Mook refers to ""employees."" But as the Sanders campaign has argued -- citing analyses by Greenpeace and the Huffington Post -- Clinton’s campaign has also received donations from lobbyists who have ties to oil and gas interests. These donations would not be reported as having come from employees of oil and gas companies and thus aren’t included in the total we calculated above. The Huffington Post article, from July 17, 2015, found that ""nearly all of the lobbyists bundling contributions for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign have at one time or another worked for the fossil fuel industry."" It links to 40 registered lobbyists but only offers details on some donors who still work for the industry. The Greenpeace report says that when you add in donations by lobbyists with an alleged tie to the fossil fuel industry, Clinton's total would rise to nearly $1.8 million. The fossil fuel industry's share of the Clinton coffers would go up to about 0.8 percent. The Sanders campaign added that the Greenpeace report goes a step further to include more than $4 million to Priorities Action USA, the super PAC that supports Clinton. And the Sanders team said that Chevron, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil have donated at least $2.5 million to the Clinton Foundation. ""I understand the Clinton campaign objects to these figures, because some of the fossil fuel lobbyists who have bundled huge sums of money for their campaign also represent clients in other industries,"" said Sanders spokesman Warren Gunnels. ""In our view, that makes these contributions even more objectionable. It's the lobbyists in Washington who write the bills and curry special favors for the firms they represent. You can't reform big oil and gas companies by taking bundled campaign cash from their lobbyists."" The Sanders critique is not a slam-dunk, however For starters, it’s a stretch to draw a direct line between those super PAC donations and Clinton’s campaign. Under federal law, the candidates have no control over super PAC spending. In addition, it’s up for debate how significant these lobbyists’ donations are. It’s not clear how much of influence the oil and gas industry would wield through a donor who once lobbied for them but doesn’t any more. In some cases, the lobbyists advocated for clients in multiple industries, not just oil and gas.  Finally, Clinton’s stances on oil and gas issues is not exactly in tune with the industry. She has said that if individuals from the industry want to donate to her, they should know that they may be wasting their money. She favors policies the oil and gas industry doesn’t like, and she is a big supporter of renewable energy, a philosophy Sanders has also embraced. Our ruling Mook wrote, ""In last week’s debate, Bernie questioned Hillary’s commitment to fighting climate change because a whopping 0.2 percent of the money given to our campaign has come from employees of oil and gas companies. Not even 2 percent, mind you: 0.2 percent."" Mook’s statement is accurate, though it’s carefully constructed to exclude donations by lobbyists who have at one time represented the industry -- a point made by Sanders, though its relevance is up for debate",Mostly True,"April 22, 2016"
"""Every bit of plastic that has ever been created still exists.""","Paper or plastic? It's not just a question being posed at the checkout counter anymore. Activists have been arguing for years that plastic bags harm the environment, but now there's also concern that  plastic products may be a detriment to the planet because they break down so slowly -- or not at all. That's the point made by actor Jeff Bridges in a March 28 Facebook video that he narrates on behalf of the Plastic Pollution Coalition. When last we checked, it had over 453,000 shares. A statement at the beginning caught our attention: ""Plastic is a substance the Earth cannot digest, and every bit of plastic that has ever been created still exists,"" he says. ""Plastic never goes away."" Every bit still exists? Never goes away? We wondered how quickly that claim would degrade under scrutiny. Unlike some types of plastic, it fell apart pretty quickly. Yes, some types of plastic are very slow to decompose, and under some conditions plastics can persist for decades or centuries. Bridges has a point that these types are pollutants and major causes for concern. But all the researchers we talked to said plastics have gone away. Eric Grulke, associate dean for research in the college of engineering at the University of Kentucky, said a lot of plastic products are no longer around because they've been burned. Incinerators consume them, sometimes to generate electricity, he said. That's most often done in Europe and Japan, where about 12 percent of solid waste is plastic, said Anthony Andrady, a chemical and biomolecular engineer at North Carolina State University. Other plastic decomposes at varying rates, depending on the type of plastic and where it is. Polyethylene, ""which is your basic hefty bag material, breaks down really, really slowly, and in a landfill it might not break down at all because it's typically starved of oxygen and water. So a polyethylene bag made in 1960 might still be with us, particularly if it's in a landfill,"" said Eric Beckman, a chemical and petroleum engineer at the University of Pittsburgh. ""On the other hand, if  you're talking about polylactic acid, which is popular in disposable tableware these days, that's actually designed to degrade,"" he said. ""And if it's in a composting environment, it will go away in a matter of weeks to months."" ""If it's sitting out in the environment, within a year it would be dust,"" said Grulke. Sheets of polylactic acid that line rows of crops on a farm, allowing the plants to poke through but deterring the growth of weeds, are made to decompose in sunlight. The same ultraviolet light that damages our skin ""chops up organic molecules fairly efficient,"" said Beckman. Not a lot of microscopic bugs have a talent for breaking apart the strong bonds that make many plastics so durable. But they exist, said Rigoberto Advincula, chairman of the polymer chemistry division of the American Chemical Society. And not all decomposition is good. In the ocean, there's two types of degradation, said Beckman. ""The good type is when it's actually chemically falling apart. When you have water and sunlight, that helps things go faster. There's also mechanical degradation, where you have a bottle that slowly gets ground down by bumping into other things and becomes chips. That's bad because fish will eat that. You can find fish with bits of plastic in their stomach."" Andrady said it's not universally desirable to have plastics break down or be burned because it takes a lot of energy to make them, energy that could be saved if they were recycled. To throw away a styrofoam cup or plastic cutlery ""is a waste,"" he said. And someday, if we run out of the oil that serves as the raw material for making resilient plastics and there are landfills with high concentrations of plastic waste, ""I can imagine people mining the landfills to get that resource. That is not inconceivable at all."" Andrady said. We contacted Bridges' press spokeswoman, called the Plastic Pollution Coalition (their voicemail wasn't accepting messages) and emailed the group two different ways. None of our inquires produced a response. Our ruling Bridges' statement was absolute: ""Every bit of plastic that has ever been created still exists."" The experts say that's rubbish. ""It's too all-encompassing,"" said Beckman. Although far too much plastic persists in the environment in places and in forms that are unwanted, too much has been burned or degraded to make the assertion accurate",False,"April 14, 2016"
"Says Hillary Clinton supported and continues to ""support fracking.""","Looking to out-green Hillary Clinton in New York, Bernie Sanders charged that Clinton’s position on fracking was at odds with voters. New Yorkers ended the practice in the state in 2014, and Sanders called for a nationwide ban during an April 11 rally in Binghamton. Clinton, in contrast, remains on the side of the frackers, Sanders said on NBC’s Meet the Press, when he launched a multipart attack on Clinton’s positions on fracking, trade and campaign finance. ""Well, when you vote for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs, when you support and continue to support fracking, despite the crisis that we have in terms of clean water,"" he said April 10, ""and essentially, when you have a super PAC that is raising tens of millions of dollars from every special interest out there, including $15 million from Wall Street, the American people do not believe that that is the kind of president that we need to make the changes in America to protect the working families of this country."" Was Sanders telling the fracking truth? (We examined Clinton’s support for free trade in a separate fact-check.) While Clinton’s past support of fracking is well documented, her current position leaves more wiggle room than Sanders’ statement suggests. Shale promoted 'round the world To refresh, fracking or hydraulic fracturing means producers are blasting pressurized water, sand and chemicals into shale rock miles underground to extract natural gas. The Environmental Protection Agency considers shale gas to be clean energy. Some environmentalists, though, are doubtful that it’s that much better than coal or oil, given reports that fracking can cause methane leaks (a greenhouse gas that’s much more potent than carbon dioxide) and earthquakes and set water ablaze. Clinton clearly supported the practice as secretary of state. Her special envoy for international energy affairs launched the Global Shale Gas Initiative encouraging other countries to explore shale as an energy source. An in-depth investigation by progressive magazine Mother Jones said that Clinton’s support of fracking was ""part of a broader push to fight climate change, boost global energy supply, and undercut the power of adversaries such as Russia that use their energy resources as a cudgel."" We found instances of Clinton and the State Department talking up fracking to Latin America, the European Union, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Bulgaria, Pakistan, China and India. ""The United States will promote the use of shale gas. Now, I know that in some places is controversial. But natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel available for power generation today, and a number of countries in the Americas may have shale gas resources,"" Clinton said in a 2009 speech to the Inter-American Development Bank. After Clinton left the State Department in 2013, she continued to support fracking but repeatedly called for ""smart regulations"" in speeches and in her book, Hard Choices. Fracking with nuance in 2016 Compared with Sanders’ unequivocal opposition and the Republicans’ strong support, Clinton has a more complicated answer when it comes to fracking. Essentially, she supports it as long as there’s environmental oversight and no local opposition. Here’s how Clinton detailed her position during the March 6 debate in Flint, Michigan: ""I don’t support it when any locality or any state is against it, No. 1. I don’t support it when the release of methane or contamination of water is present. I don’t support it — No. 3 — unless we can require that anybody who fracks has to tell us exactly what chemicals they are using. So by the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place. And I think that’s the best approach, because right now, there are places where fracking is going on that are not sufficiently regulated."" (""My answer is a lot shorter,"" responded Sanders. ""No, I do not support fracking."") Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin referred us to Clinton’s plan ""to address the fracking-related risks people are concerned about."" ""This is particularly important given that the federal government doesn’t get to say where fracking occurs and where it doesn’t, but can put new safeguards in place,"" Schwerin said. Katie Brown of Energy in Depth, the research and education arm of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, told PolitiFact that Sanders’ position to ban all fracking is outside the mainstream. ""Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, joins Democrats across the county such as Sen. Chuck Schumer, and California Gov. Jerry Brown, and Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (just to name a few), who have all touted strong regulations by the states and supported fracking for its environmental and economic benefits,"" Brown said. Warren Gunnels, Sanders’ policy director, referred us to a Reuters article, in which supporters of fracking cast Clinton’s comments as campaign rhetoric and opponents urged her to cut the caveats and ban it outright. But what exactly would Clinton’s caveats mean for frackers? A portrait of regulated extraction Clinton’s three conditions would uphold existing bans and add new ones to the mix. But they wouldn’t amount to a universal ban. The first condition leaves local and state bans in place, such as those in Vermont, New York and a few dozen cities and counties across America. Her second condition would add dozens of sites that have methane emissions or water contamination. Natural gas is primarily methane, so we’ll assume Clinton is talking about ""fugitive emissions"" or leaks. Estimates for fugitive emissions, typically expressed as a percentage of the total production, vary widely. A round up of studies by watchdog blog Carbon Brief found estimates ranging from 0.6 to 9 percent (the threshold for being cleaner than coal is 3.2 percent). Various industry and independent research has indicated that a good chunk of leaks come from a small number of ""super-emitters"" (roughly one in 25 facilities, according to a 2015 Colorado State University study). Clinton could ostensibly shut down these methane spewers, which include, for example, about 50 production sites in northern Texas and four lift wells in the Gulf Coast. Water contamination is not systemic, according to a controversial 2015 EPA study, which nonetheless identified 151 cases of fracking fluid spills in 11 states from 2006 to 2012. Robert Howarth, a noted critic of fracking and biogeochemist at Cornell University, estimates at least 4 percent of production wells pollute water, but contends that the problem is widespread given the sheer number of wells. Under Clinton’s condition, fracking could be banned in, for example, at least 25 counties in Pennsylvania and at least 12 counties in Colorado, if not in all 11 states with noted cases of spills. Frackers are already meeting Clinton’s third condition, to an extent. At least 26 states have some rules on chemical disclosure on the books, though most allow frackers to protect ""trade secrets,"" according to the American Chemical Society. In addition, the Obama administration now requires drillers on federal and tribal lands to report the composition of their fracking fluid to FracFocus, an industry-backed registry of more than 100,000 wells across America. (Here’s an example.) Environmentalists contend that these rules are not nearly enough. Howarth told PolitiFact that chemical additives are ""a small part of the problem."" ""The frack return fluids are full of really nasty materials in addition to the additives, and the precise nature of this toxic brew is seldom known,"" he said. ""Clinton's focus on just the additives is misguided."" That being said, Clinton’s condition could ban fracking in Virginia and Missouri, two states with fracking activity but no disclosure rules in place at the time of this report. Here’s a map that shows how Clinton’s conditions could affect fracking in America:  Our ruling Sanders said that Clinton supported and continues ""to support fracking."" As secretary of state, Clinton supported and promoted fracking around the world. As a 2016 candidate, her support comes with conditions such as local choice, stronger environmental regulation and chemicals.

"Says Chris Abele ""has had five years and he’s done nothing"" about the Estabrook Dam.","The fate of the Estabrook Dam on the Milwaukee River has played an outsized role during the 2016 campaign for Milwaukee County Executive. That’s especially true because, despite a 6-year-old order from the state Department of Natural Resources to either repair or replace the 80-year-old structure, and a circuit court order declaring the dam a nuisance, the issue has not been resolved. County Executive Chris Abele wants to tear the dam down, but the County Board has voted to repair the structure. When Abele challenger Chris Larson was on the board, he voted to repair the dam, but now says he’s willing to consider removing it because public sentiment seems to have changed. But Larson, a state senator, also has been sharply critical of Abele’s leadership on the issue. Both are Democrats running for the nonpartisan office in the April 5, 2016 election. Abele ""has had five years and he’s done nothing"" about the dam, Larson said during a March 29, 2016 appearance before the Rotary Club of Milwaukee and the Milwaukee Press Club. That echoed what he wrote in a March 15, 2016 email to supporters: ""The current county executive has provided no leadership in forging a consensus on what to do with the dam, he has no urgency in addressing this problem."" Is Larson correct that Abele has ""done nothing"" on the matter? The options There are two major alternatives before county officials. Removal: The Milwaukee Riverkeepers, a coalition of environmental groups, has urged the removal of the dam. They note that the removal of the North Avenue Dam, a few miles downstream, led to improved water quality and a thriving fish and wildlife population. Advocates also argue the Estabrook Dam primarily benefits a small number of property owners who enjoy the impoundment, or lake, that the dam creates. They say that is unfair -- even illegal -- because a public facility is creating benefits for a few private property owners. Repair: The Milwaukee River Preservation Association, a group that includes riverfront property owners, and others, including County Board Chairman Theo Lipscomb, favor repairing the dam. They argue the dam creates an important water recreational area and say its removal could lead to the release of toxins built up behind the structure over the decades. Under orders by the federal government, the county hired a consultant, AECOM, to conduct an environmental assessment of the dam. The $250,000 report, released in early 2015, did not recommend an option. But it did note public sentiment at meetings held in September 2014 was about 2-to-1 in favor of removal and said that over time it would cost twice as much to repair and continue operating the dam than it would be to remove it. The report also cited the environmental benefits to allowing water to flow freely and called removal the most ""environmentally protective alternative."" The report was conducted during Abele’s tenure, under orders from the federal government, because it was believed, at the time, that the feds owned an island that is connected to the dam. Abele’s tenure There’s considerable disagreement between Abele and some members of the County Board -- especially Lipscomb, who represents the area -- over how to address the dam. If you had to describe Abele’s record on the dam in one word, it would be ""hamstrung."" On at least two occasions involving the 2015 budget, Lipscomb succeed in getting the board to insert money into the county budget -- first to repair the dam and later to build a fish passage, which is a component of one of the rebuilding options. Abele vetoed both, with one overridden and one sustained. In between the votes and vetoes, Abele’s parks department sent a memo to the board urging it to take action and noting the board itself had changed its position from remove to replace several times. Abele also sent the board a resolution to remove the dam, noting that repairs had become increasingly expensive. And Abele’s chief of staff, Raisa Koltun, followed up with several emails to Lipscomb, but the matter was never scheduled for a vote. Beyond the stalemate with the County Board, Koltun said Abele has worked to forge a consensus with local units of government that have an interest in the dam, including the city of Milwaukee, villages of Shorewood and Brown Deer and the Metropolitan Milwaukee Sewerage District. He has also worked with groups like the Sierra Club, Trout Unlimited and the Milwaukee Riverkeeper, as well as pursued private and federal funding to help pay for the dam’s removal. Our rating Larson says Abele has had five years in office and ""done nothing"" about the Estabrook Dam, with an earlier statement blaming him for a lack of consensus. But records and news accounts show Abele has been consistent in wanting the dam removed, has taken steps to make his wishes known and to build support for removal among nearby communities and other groups. Along the way, he has been thwarted by the County Board. Larson’s statement was that Abele has done nothing",False,"April 1, 2016"
"""The EPA has tried to define a puddle or a drainage ditch on your farm to be navigable waters and thus subject to massive environmental regulations.""","Ted Cruz says the Environmental Protection Agency has gone overboard in regulating farms by regulating even puddles and ditches. ""They're hurting from a federal government whose policies have been making it harder and harder for farmers to survive. They're hurting from an EPA who is imposing massive burdens on farms,"" Cruz said in a March 29 CNN town hall in Milwaukee, Wis. ""For example, the Waters of the United States Rule (is) where the EPA has tried to define a puddle or a drainage ditch on your farm to be navigable waters and thus subject to massive environmental regulations."" Are puddles and drainage ditches regulated by the EPA? We’ll wade through the research to find out. A Cruz spokesman did not answer our questions for this fact-check. What a water rule said about puddles  The Clean Water Act passed in 1972 after high-profile disasters and pollution problems, including the Cuyahoga River fire in Ohio and fish kills at Florida’s Lake Thonotosassa in 1969. The goal of the act was to regulate discharges into water, but for years industry groups and environmental advocates debated which bodies of water should be included. U.S. Supreme Court rulings in 2001 and 2006 created uncertainty about the law’s reach. In May 2015, the EPA announced a new rule intended to clarify which bodies of water fall under the act. But within months it was put on hold nationwide pending litigation and remaind on hold as of the writing of this fact-check -- a key point that Cruz omitted. The crux of the rule wasn’t the size of the bodies of water, but whether a body of water could carry pollution into other larger waters. The EPA wants to regulate tributaries, ponds, streams and wetlands to prevent businesses, farms or other entities from dumping waste into the water. Before the rule was finalized, the EPA invited public comment and the regulation of puddles became a talking point for conservatives and business advocates who bashed the rule as federal overreach. To clear up matters, the final rule explicitly addressed the question of puddles: ""The proposed rule did not explicitly exclude puddles because the agencies have never considered puddles to meet the minimum standard for being a 'water of the United States,' and it is an inexact term. A puddle is commonly considered a very small, shallow, and highly transitory pool of water that forms on pavement or uplands during or immediately after a rainstorm or similar precipitation event. However, numerous commenters asked that the agencies expressly exclude them in a rule. The final rule does so."" The American Farm Bureau Federation has argued that the rule language was so broad that it could ultimately include something not much larger than a puddle. Spokesman William Rodger says that puddles could be classified as ""vernal pools"" or ""wetlands"" and then fall under the EPA’s jurisdiction. ""We stand by our assertion that puddles – as commonly understood by the average person – can be regulated under the Waters of the United States rule,"" he said in response to our questions about Cruz’s statement But multiple environmental experts have told PolitiFact Florida that they were skeptical that the EPA would end up regulating puddles. ""It is an absurd assertion,"" William L. Andreen, University of Alabama law professor, told PolitiFact Florida in October. ""There are no cases on point because the agencies have never asserted jurisdiction in such fantastical situations."" What the water rule said about ditches The EPA had previously interpreted the Clean Water Act to include jurisdiction over ditches but sought to provide clarity with the new rule, which also contained the puddle exclusion. The rule does not regulate most ditches, according to the EPA. Here is what it does say about ditches: ""The rule continues the current policy of regulating ditches that are constructed in tributaries or are relocated tributaries or, in certain circumstances drain wetlands, or that science clearly demonstrates are functioning as a tributary. These jurisdictional waters affect the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of downstream waters. The rule further reduces existing confusion and inconsistency regarding the regulation of ditches by explicitly excluding certain categories of ditches, such as ditches that flow only after precipitation."" Farmers feared that ditches that flow only during or after a rain would be classified in a way that would put them under enforcement. U.S. Rep. Dave Loebsack, D-Iowa, raised that concern in a March 22 congressional hearing. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said that even if it rains hard and looks like there’s streams everywhere, those don’t count, she said. ""It only has to be something that is constructed or natural that really can impact the downstream water. After that, there's no connection,"" McCarthy said. The EPA wrote in a response to comments about ditches: ""The agencies do not intend to increase the number of ditches that are jurisdictional. In fact, by clarifying and expanding the specific exclusions for ditches, the agencies anticipate that more ditches will be clearly excluded in comparison to previous regulations and guidance related to waters of the U.S."" Our ruling Cruz said, ""The EPA has tried to define a puddle or a drainage ditch on your farm to be navigable waters and thus subject to massive environmental regulations."" The EPA’s water rule specifically excludes puddles. It only applies to ditches that are constructed out of streams or ditches that function like streams and could carry pollution to downstream waters. Cruz omits that the water rule was put on hold by the courts in 2015 pending litigation",Mostly False,"March 31, 2016"
"An image in a Chris Abele TV ad depicts ""wealthy citizens"" who would benefit from a ""lake"" created by the controversial Estabrook Dam.","A new television ad from Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele shows a large body of water with a sizable boat tied up in front of a two-story boathouse. That image forms the backdrop for a statement printed on the screen about his opponent’s support of repairs to the Estabrook Dam on the Milwaukee River: ""Chris Larson: $5 million of taxpayer money to benefit a few wealthy citizens."" The narrator takes the claim further, saying the repairs give the wealthy residents ""their own lake."" The message conveyed by the image is clear: These are the properties of those wealthy residents living along the lake created by the Estabrook Dam. Only they’re not. A deeper dive Before we, um, dive into this one, here is some background on the long-running debate over whether to repair the dam. Built in the 1930s, the dam -- which sits on the river just north of Milwaukee, at the border of Shorewood and Glendale -- was installed to help control flooding and to maintain swimming and water recreation in an urban setting, especially in and around Lincoln Park. It has also created generations of what amounts to lakefront living for some people. When the dam gates are closed, the river forms a 100-acre impoundment upstream. There are about 165 property owners in the area whose property abuts the water, according to a 2015 report prepared for the county. Today, the dam is in poor condition,. The state Department of Natural Resources has ordered the county to keep the gates open until the structure is either repaired or abandoned. That means the lake has been, in effect, drained, and it’s a plain-old river again. Abele and the County Board have disagreed about how to proceed. Larson himself was a member of the board before he was elected state Senator. Abele sides with the Milwaukee Riverkeepers, a coalition of environmental groups that wants the dam removed so the river can be kept in its natural state. Years ago, the North Avenue Dam, several miles downstream, was removed and experts have said the faster current has led to improved water quality, a thriving fish population and new wildlife habitat. A majority of the County Board disagrees and wants to spend about $3.4 million on repairs and $2.2 million in operating and maintenance costs over the next 20 years. As a county supervisor, Larson voted in 2009 to repair the dam. That’s the genesis of the $5 million figure Abele used in the ad. However, in a recent  interview, Larson said he’s willing to consider removing the dam. Image is all wet That leads us to the image used in the ad. It looks more like Door County than the Milwaukee River. And that’s not the kind of boat or property you’d find in that area. The boat pictured is either a fishing boat or cruiser and could be up to 36-feet long, said Charles Plueddeman, an Oshkosh-based freelance writer who focuses on the marine industry. ""A boat this size could be used on large lakes or offshore in salt water,"" he said. ""When I looked at the photo my first thought was ‘this does not look like Wisconsin,’"" Plueddeman said. ""I've not been to that site, but I don't think it would be surrounded by the high, rocky bluffs in this photo. And that would be a very big boat to use on that little impoundment."" Indeed, pontoons and jet skis are more commonly found in the area, said Clark Blachly, who owns a nearby home. ""I have been up and down this river hundreds of times there is nothing remotely like this,"" he said. We asked Abele’s campaign manager Tia Torhorst about the image in the ad. She said it was ""stock footage"" and was unaware of where it was shot. In short, it’s not the Milwaukee River. We’ve seen previous -- admittedly higher profile -- instances of the wrong images being used to make point in a political ad. Earlier this year, Republican Donald Trump aired a TV ad purporting to show Mexicans swarming over ""our southern border."" But the footage was of African migrants streaming over a fence between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Melilla",False Pants on Fire,"March 29, 2016"
"""The [Obama] administration’s regulatory assault on coal-fired energy has put thousands of Americans out of work""","Supporters of the coal industry have criticized President Barack Obama’s administration as it attempts to establish stricter environmental regulations on coal-fired plants in the U.S. The Clean Power Plan is the administration’s latest initiative to combat climate change. The Environmental Protection Agency proposes restrictions on coal-fired plants to reduce carbon emissions. On Feb. 9 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the Clean Power Plan would not be allowed to go into effect until the court is able to hear arguments from those who support and oppose the plan. Before that ruling, Republican Sen. Roy Blunt spoke out against the Clean Power Plan in a January press release. Blunt said: ""The administration’s regulatory assault on coal-fired energy has put thousands of Americans out of work, and threatens to double utility costs for Missouri families by 2020."" We decided to look into that statement. Employment in the coal industry Employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows jobs in coal were declining well before Obama took office in 2009. Coal mining employment has been dropping since 1985.  There are a number of market factors contributing to the long downturn, including technological innovation, investments in natural gas and renewable energy. PolitiFact has reported on the Obama administration’s impact on the coal industry before and found coal has been losing to natural gas for a while now. Natural gas attracts companieslooking for cheaper, cleaner and more efficient energy. Employment in the coal industry has declined faster since Obama’s first term, but Josh Bivens, research and policy director at the Economic Policy Institute, a group that receives significant funding from labor unions, says regulations adopted by the administration so far probably only had a marginal effect. Instead, the decline has to do more with cheaper natural gas. ""More than anything to me, they’re just sort of locking in the coal declines that were originally caused by the decline in natural gas prices,"" Bivens said. ""The single biggest factor in the decline of the coal sector over the past decade has been the big fall in the price of natural gas."" Bivens added that if the Clean Power Plan goes into effect, he expects jobs in the coal industry to decline further. Electric bills We can’t fact-check a prediction, so Blunt’s assertion about the doubling of utility costs is beyond the scope of this fact-check. But we did look into the source behind his forecast. Blunt spokesman Brian Hart pointed us to this study on behalf of a group of Midwest utilities and regulators.  We found two significant issues. First, the study says Missouri electricity bills could possibly double by 2030, not 2020. Second, the study was conducted in 2009, but Obama and the EPA didn’t actually propose the Clean Power Plan until 2015. The methodologies used to conduct the study aren’t consistent with Obama’s current environmental proposal. But we did find a study from the U.S. Environmental Information Administration that specifically breaks down how the Clean Power Plan will affect electrical utilities. That agency predicts electricity prices will rise slightly in the early 2020s. Prices will differ across the country, but the highest rise in prices is predicted to be 7 percent. Our ruling Blunt said the Obama administration’s regulations have caused thousands of workers in the coal industry to lose their jobs. While the decline in coal industry employment is real, the role of administration policy is less certain. Experts note that competition from abundant, cheap natural gas has reduced the demand for coal more than any other factor. With less demand, the need for workers falls. While the administration has encouraged movement away from coal for environmental reasons, market forces in the energy sector have been the dominant driver. While it is impossible to know how utility costs will rise or fall in the future, the study on which Blunt based his claims was conducted before the Clean Power Plan was enacted. Blunt’s claim overemphasizes the role of White House policy",Mostly False,"March 16, 2016"
"""The Clean Power Plan is something that Sen. Sanders has said he would delay implementing.""","Debating in a city where rising sea levels are a concern, Hillary Clinton suggested Bernie Sanders wants to set back a major climate change policy of the Obama administration. ""The Clean Power Plan is something that Sen. Sanders has said he would delay implementing, which makes absolutely no sense,"" Clinton said. ""What? Tsk,"" Sanders said, laughing and shaking his head incredulously. ""Wait, what?"" was our reaction too. Looking at statements and actions by Sanders, Clinton’s statement is misleading. Briefly, the Clean Power Plan aims to cut carbon emissions from coal-burning power plants by 2030 by 32 percent from 2005 levels, promoting clean(er) energy sources instead. This plan, hailed and criticized as a historic environmental initiative, was put on hold on Feb. 9, 2016, by the U.S. Supreme Court. We searched Google, LexisNexis and CQ for comments Sanders has made on the plan and found no evidence that Sanders has said he wants to delay the implementation. The Clinton campaign referred us to Sanders’ Feb. 21 interview with Grist, an environmental online magazine, in which he laid out what President Sanders would likely do on climate change. Sanders said he would change the Clean Power Plan to incentivize renewables instead of gas and extend a two-year program for wind and solar credits all the way to 2030. And beyond carbon, he would also regulate methane through the plan. The Clinton campaign also cited environmental law expert Richard Revesz’s blog post for The Hill criticizing Sanders. The Clean Power Plan ""cannot be changed at the stroke of the pen,"" Revesz wrote a few days after the Grist interview, and Sanders’ actions would ""stop the train and cause a great delay."" (Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor, made the same argument.) But Sanders himself did not say he would delay implementation. In reality, he wants a more ambitious plan (and has released one) and has supported Obama’s plan from the get-go. A day before it was unveiled, Sanders said in a press release, ""It sounds to me like a step forward in ending our dependence on fossil fuel, and I support that effort."" He also tweeted that day, ""Pres Obama knows climate change is the great planetary crisis facing us & we must move boldly to transform our energy system #CleanPowerPlan."" And in November, Sanders voted twice against legislation to block the Clean Power Plan. ""It is an embarrassment that with few exceptions Republicans refuse to recognize the reality of climate change, and even fewer are prepared to do anything about it,"" he wrote in a press release following the effort to repeal the plan. ""Today’s vote to block the Clean Power Plan is a stark reminder that instead of worrying about the future of our planet, Republicans are more concerned with their campaign contributions."" Our ruling Clinton said, ""The Clean Power Plan is something that Sen. Sanders has said he would delay implementing."" Sanders advocates for more ambitious action on climate change, which some experts argue could delay the plan. But Sanders himself has never said what Clinton is suggesting, and he has supported the Clean Power Act in words and action",False,"March 10, 2016"
"""We have a higher rate of tested lead in people in Cleveland than in Flint.""","The Democratic debate in Flint, Mich., opened with a discussion of the city’s lead poisoning crisis, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Flint isn’t the only place where serious action is needed. ""We have a lot of communities right now in our country where the level of toxins in the water, including lead, are way above what anybody should tolerate,"" Clinton said. ""We have a higher rate of tested lead in people in Cleveland than in Flint. So I’m not satisfied with just doing everything we must do for Flint. I want to tackle this problem across the board."" We were curious about Clinton’s claim that Cleveland has it worse. If you stopped listening there, you might have thought she was saying the tap water in Ohio’s second-largest city is also contaminated with lead — which is not the case. Later in the debate, Clinton made a point of mentioning lead coming from other sources, too: ""I want us to have an absolute commitment to getting rid of lead wherever it is because it's not only in water systems, it's also in soil, and it's in lead paint that is found mostly in older homes,"" she said. The Clinton campaign cited an article in the Cleveland Plain Dealer, and we found other reports and data that back her point. Lead poisoning leads to serious neurological and behavioral effects ranging from shortened attention spans and developmental disabilities to coma and even death. While no level of lead is safe in children, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses a reference level of 5 micrograms of lead per one deciliter of blood as an indicator of higher-than-usual blood lead levels. According to the CDC, 2.5 percent of American children age 5 and under — about a half million kids — test at this level. Residents of Flint have been consuming tap water with lead since 2014, when the city switched its water source to the polluted Flint River to save money. In 2015, 4 percent of all kids and 6.3 percent of kids in high-risk areas had elevated blood lead levels, according to an analysis by Monica Hanna-Attisha, a researcher at Flint’s Hurley Children’s Hospital. Clinton has a point that many other American cities are dealing with the toxin. Lead-contaminated tap water has run through faucets in Washington D.C., Durham, N.C., Lakehurst Acres, Maine, Jackson, Miss. and other places throughout the years. But in most places, lead poisoning elsewhere is mainly due to lead-based paint in older houses. That’s the case for Cleveland, where a whopping 14.2 percent of kids tested at the reference level in 2014, according to the Cuyahoga County Board of Health. In the county, 10.3 percent of kids had elevated blood levels. Cleveland and Cuyahoga County aren’t exactly outliers. Looking at 2014 CDC surveillance data for 1,425 counties in 29 states, 288 counties have higher rates of lead poisoning than Flint. (We should caution that the data is far from perfect; for example, 100 percent of kids in Colfax County, N.M., tested positive, but the sample size was just 33 kids.) What’s more, 15 counties had the same percentage or higher rates of poisoned children as Flint, but at double the reference blood-lead level:  Our ruling Clinton said, ""We have a higher rate of tested lead in people in Cleveland than in Flint."" In Flint, 4 percent of all kids and 6.3 percent of kids in high-risk areas in Flint tested positive for lead poisoning in 2015. In Cleveland, that rate was 14.2 percent in 2014. However, the lead in Cleveland came from paint, not water, and Clinton's initial phrasing made that unclear",Mostly True,"March 7, 2016"
"Says Donald Trump ""wants to keep big government in charge"" of federally-owned land.","Of all the controversies associated with Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, his position on federally owned land tends to attract less attention. But the issue of public land ownership is important to Nevadans, where federal government agencies manage and control around 85 percent of state land. And it’s partially why Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is slamming Trump on the issue in a campaign ad airing just days before the Nevada Republican presidential caucus on Feb. 23. ""Eighty-five percent of Nevada is owned and regulated by the federal government,"" says Cruz in the ad. ""And Donald Trump wants to keep big government in charge. That’s ridiculous."" The ad has aired dozens of times in Reno through the lead up to Nevada's caucus, according to Political TV Ad Archive. We thought Cruz’s claim merited fact-checking, because public lands management is a critical issue with Nevada voters. An on-screen graphic refers to a January interview with Field & Stream magazine, where Trump said he would be hesitant to give federal land over to state and local governments. ""I don’t like the idea, because I want to keep the lands great, and you don’t know what the state is going to do,"" he told an interviewer. ""I mean, are they going to sell if they get into a little bit of trouble?"" Trump’s campaign offered a slightly more detailed explanation of his proposed policy in an answer to a candidate questionnaire, but said the bigger issue was land management and not transfer of ownership. ""The issue is not that so much of the state is public land; it is how that land is managed,"" the campaign wrote, promising to cut ""needless bureaucratic red tape."" The Trump campaign didn’t return emails seeking comment. Cruz, on the other hand, takes a more libertarian stance on public land issues and said the amount of land owned by the federal government is ""unacceptable."" ""I believe we should transfer as much federal land as possible back to the states and ideally back to the people,"" he told the Las Vegas Review-Journal in December. Cruz fought with the Bureau of Land Management over the agency's efforts to ""claim 90,000 acres of disputed land near Texas’s Red River,"" and for a time supported Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy’s standoff with the federal government over his unpaid grazing fees. And many of the Texas senator’s Nevada supporters pushed for a failed bill in the state Legislature that ""would lay claim to almost all federally managed public lands and water rights in the state."" It’s worth noting that Nevada’s state constitution expressly gives up the state’s rights to all ""unappropriated public lands"" to the federal government, which is why it’s worth quibbling with candidates like Cruz and Rubio promise to ""return"" control to its citizens  — who have never held a claim to the federally owned land in the past 151 years of Nevada statehood. Our ruling Cruz says that Trump wants to keep ""big government"" in charge of Nevada’s public lands. Trump has answered questions on public land management twice. He has not advocated for transferring ownership, but he has focused on cutting bureaucratic red tape. Cruz exaggerates Trump's position slightly by saying Trump favors ""big"" government",True,"February 23, 2016"
"""Not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real.""","Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders has been contending that all of his Republican opponents are climate change deniers. The matter came up during the Feb. 4 Democratic debate in New Hampshire when Sanders talked about the way money and influence are leveraged to sway political positions. ""Let's talk about climate change,"" he said. ""Do you think there's a reason why not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real, and that we need to transform our energy system? Do you think it has anything to do with the Koch brothers and ExxonMobil pouring huge amounts of money into the political system? That is what goes on in America."" Not one Republican recognizes that climate change is real? We decided to look at the positions of the GOP candidates who were in the race when Sanders made his statement. The climate change question has several elements. Some candidates acknowledge that Earth's climate has changed in recent decades but insist that natural forces — not human activity — are responsible. Some acknowledge that humans are playing a significant role in climate change but argue that there's little the United States can do by itself to reverse the global warming trend. Others are pushing for specific proposals to address the issue. So where do the Republican candidates stand? Last August, NPR produced a chart showing how all the candidates viewed the various aspects of the climate question. In addition, we repeatedly emailed all the candidates' campaigns to see if that chart was still accurate and whether there were additional nuances that had surfaced in the intervening six months. We heard from the Chris Christie, Carly Fiorina and John Kasich campaigns. Spokespeople for Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Donald Trump didn't respond. We also checked their campaign websites for updated information on how they felt about the climate change question. On the issue of whether climate has been changing significantly in recent decades, Bush, Christie, Fiorina, Kasich and Rubio say that it has. Bush, Christie, Fiorina and Kasich say it's man made. Rubio says it's not. Bush, Christie, Fiorina and Kasich have called for some degree of action to combat it. For example, Christie's campaign sent us comments from an April town hall meeting in Exeter, N.H., where the candidate said, ""I don’t believe we can do this on our own. We have to have cooperation with the rest of the world. If America changes its behavior and puts up with the economic ramifications that will happen from changing that behavior in the short term, the rest of the world has to engage in it with us."" Fiorina's campaign made a similar point, quoting the candidate on CNBC in September as saying that innovation would be the key: ""That's how you're going to solve an intractable problem. It's always the way you solve an intractable problem. Not with regulation — with innovation."" She made the same point during a Nov. 16 town hall meeting. Bush in July said humans have contributed to climate change. ""The climate is changing; I don’t think anybody can argue it’s not,"" Bush told Bloomberg. ""Human activity has contributed to it. I think we have a responsibility to adapt to what the possibilities are without destroying our economy, without hollowing out our industrial core.""   So clearly, some GOP candidates are not denying the problem at all. During the debate, Sanders referred to ""Republicans,"" not the GOP presidential candidates. But two days earlier, at an event in Keene, N.H., he specifically said, ""We do not have one Republican candidate for president acknowledging this (climate change) reality."" Even if he was referring to party supporters in general, a 2013 Pew poll found that 23 percent of people who lean Republican say there is solid evidence that Earth is warming and human activity is responsible. And a 2013 bipartisan poll found that 53 percent of Republican voters under age 35 picked either ""crazy,"" ""ignorant"" or ""out of touch"" to describe someone who denies that climate change is happening. Since those polls, the evidence for warming has only gotten stronger, with NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration saying that Earth’s 2015 surface temperatures were the warmest since modern record keeping began in 1880. When we asked the Sanders campaign about the claim, policy director Warren Gunnels said, ""The reality is that none of the Republicans have introduced a plan to solve climate change in a way that would transform our energy system. ... Go look at all of their websites.  None of them have a plan."" Actually, some of the GOP candidates have posted plans that deal with energy issues, although they don't go in the direction that Sanders and scientists concerned about climate change might like. Bush's website, for example, calls for the repeal or reform of the Carbon Rule, which is President Barack Obama's executive order requiring coal-fired power plants to dramatically reduce their carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. Rubio wants to get rid of some anti-pollution rules and use the free market, not government regulation, to encourage ""environmental conservation, fuel efficiency and energy diversity."" Others say little if anything on the issue. Christie's website seems to be silent on the matter. The ""climate change"" section of Kasich's website has a video saying that he cares about the environment. Carson's website simply says, ""Earth is in a constantly cycle of warming or cooling,"" Some are downright hostile. Cruz's website belittles climate change activists and calls for an end to the regulation of carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and all other sources and an end to the ""regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles",False Pants on Fire,"February 9, 2016"
"""We now have more jobs in solar than we do in oil.""","Hillary Clinton is bullish on clean energy as an economic opportunity for the United States. In a meeting last month with the Concord Monitor’s editorial board, she held out the burgeoning production of wind turbines in Iowa as evidence of the country’s potential future as the ""clean energy superpower of the 21st century."" And what’s more, the fall of fossil fuels in favor of renewables is already happening, she said. ""We now have more jobs in solar than we do in oil,"" the former Democratic secretary of state told the newspaper on Dec. 8, 2015. We’ve heard that the renewable energy market has been heating up. And sure, some of our neighbors are putting up solar panels, and these shrunken gas prices can’t be good for the oil industry. But could the total number of jobs in the field of solar power truly have surpassed the long-established and machinery-heavy oil industry? PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to have a look at the numbers. Labor statistics Clinton’s campaign cited two sources: the federal government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics and The Solar Foundation. First, we’ll shine some light on the state of America’s solar industry. The Solar Foundation estimated last year that there were roughly 174,000 people who spend at least half their working hours ""on solar-related work,"" a term that goes undefined in the nonprofit’s 67-page annual report. It notes that 90 percent or more of those workers spent 100 percent of their time on ""solar-related work."" Of the total, 97,000 are employed by installation companies, 32,000 are in manufacturing, 20,000 are in sales and distribution, 15,000 are in project development and 9,000 are classified as ""other,"" including research and development firms, nonprofits, government agencies and academic researchers. A Bureau of Labor Statistics economist, Caila Pinkleton, pointed by email to one specific solar-related current employment statistic. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed 5,170 solar photovoltaic installers employed in May 2014, a small fraction of the 97,000 people that The Solar Foundation said are employed by installation companies, of which the vast majority (92 percent) were installing photovoltaics. So there’s some discrepancy in the total number of jobs. The Solar Foundation, which describes on its website that its mission ""is to increase understanding of solar energy through strategic research and education that transforms markets,"" didn’t respond to an email seeking clarification. But the Bureau of Labor Statistics left open the possibility that the total number of jobs could be higher, noting that some solar thermal installers are classified under ""plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters"" and some solar photovoltaic electricians are listed under ""electricians."" What’s clear, according to the Solar Foundation’s numbers, is that the industry is growing quickly: from 93,502 in 2010 to 173,807 in 2014. The nonprofit recently released its updated census for this year, which showed 208,859 solar workers as of November 2015, only slightly below the 210,600 projection from a year earlier. Meanwhile, the oil and gas industries have been falling in employment, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. While Clinton specifically mentioned the oil industry, not gas, her campaign only furnished data combining the two industries. The Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn’t keep individual data for each. Clinton’s campaign referenced total employment in oil and gas extraction in December 2015, which was 185,000, compared with the 209,000 solar workers that The Solar Foundation reported in November 2015. If that was the whole story, she’d be right. But just as the solar industry has installers, manufacturers, salespeople and researchers, so does the oil and gas industry. Besides oil and gas extraction, there’s also support activities for oil and gas operations: 266,000 jobs. Oil and gas pipeline production: 124,000 jobs. Mining and oil and gas field machinery: 73,000 jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. You might even want to include the 912,000 people who work at gas stations. We aren’t going to be that pedantic. But the American Petroleum Institute is. It found that in 2007 the oil and natural gas industry directly provided 2.1 million jobs. Including the indirect impacts, API claims the industry supports more than 9 million American jobs. While this type of study is undoubtedly commissioned to promote the industry, a critic could say the same of The Solar Foundation’s work. Using only Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers, and discounting gas station employees, we’re still left with about 648,000 jobs in oil and gas spread over extraction, support activities, pipeline production and field machinery, compared to 210,000 for solar. In other words, for Clinton’s claim to be true, two out of three Americans employed by the oil and gas industries would have to be working solely with gas. Even then – comparing conservative Bureau of Labor Statistics data against generous figures from The Solar Foundation – oil would come out slightly ahead. Our ruling Clinton said ""we now have more jobs in solar than we do in oil."" But the numbers don’t support that claim. For the oil industry, she didn’t look at the whole picture. And self-reported calculations by both the solar and oil and gas industry aren’t close. Oil and gas reports 10 times more jobs.   Independent data from the federal government also shows more jobs in oil and gas compared to solar",False,"January 29, 2016"
"""The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) has estimated that the Obama administration’s Power Plan will cause energy costs in Texas to rise as much as 16 percent per year.""","U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, the Environmental Protection Agency and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have been frequent sparring partners. In a Dec. 6, 2015 oped column, Smith, R-San Antonio, took to  the San Antonio Express-News to warn readers against  the EPA’s Clean Power Plan. The EPA has described the Clean Power Plan as a necessary, though not sufficient, step in addressing climate change -- and as part of a larger strategy to spur other nations to reduce emissions. It was the subject of a previous fact check. The plan is aimed at states with fossil-fuel fired electrical plants. Smith wrote: ""Texans will be hit even harder than those in other states. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) has estimated that the Obama administration’s Power Plan will cause energy costs in Texas to rise as much as 16 percent per year."" According to the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission, ERCOT manages 90% of the electrical load of Texas; it is a nonprofit corporation. The way the statement is phrased, it sounds as though every year energy costs in Texas will rise  16 percent. But the ERCOT report on the effects of the EPA Clean Power Plan says the increase will be over a longer period of time.   Smith’s statement was based on incorrect information provided by an ERCOT official to his House Science, Space and Technology Committee. The ERCOT Oct. 16, 2015 report and an accompanying news release says that ""energy costs for customers may increase by up to 16% by 2030 due to the CPP alone, without accounting for the associated costs of transmission upgrades, higher natural gas prices caused by increased gas demand, procurement of additional ancillary services, and other costs associated with the retirement or decreased operation of coal-fired capacity in the ERCOT Region"" (ERCOT does not estimate how much these other factors might raise energy costs in their analysis). In other words, by 2030, energy costs will have risen 16 percent since the CPP took effect. So, how big is the disparity between a 16 percent increase by 2030 and a 16 percent increase each year until 2030? It helps to know when the Clean Power Plan is scheduled to come into effect. According to the EPA’s Clean Power Plan Final Rule, states with fossil fuel-fired electric generating units need to create plans that set emissions standards for those units. Vermont and the District of Columbia are exempt because they have none of the relevant units, and Alaska and Hawaii are exempt because the EPA says it lacks enough information to determine the best system of emission reduction for non-contiguous states. Plans are due in 2016 (with a possible extension to 2018), and the reduction in emissions needs to start by 2022, with extra rewards for states that also cut emissions in 2020 and 2021. If energy costs rise 16 percent each year from 2022 until 2030, that is roughly a 327 percent increase in the cost of energy. To help put this in real terms, we crunched some numbers on energy costs in Texas. The U.S. Energy Information Administration’s Residential Energy Consumption Survey reported the average annual electricity cost per Texas household at $2,160 in 2009, the last year for which data are available, and just under 4.5 percent of the median household income in Texas that year. Adjusted for inflation, that’s about $2,394 in 2015. If the Clean Power Plan caused energy costs to increase 16 percent by 2030, that bill would rise to about $2,777 in today’s dollars. If energy costs increased 16 percent per year, though, that bill would be $7,828. The median household income in Texas was $53,035 by the last Census. The first price would mean Texans would spend around 5 percent of their yearly household income on energy, while the higher number implies energy costs would eat up closer to 15 percent of income. Smith, whose 21st Congressional District includes portions of San Antonio, Austin and the Texas Hill Country, is chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, with jurisdiction over the EPA, NOAA and NASA. A spokeswoman for his committee, Laura Crist, said in an email statement that the congressman’s claim of a 16-percent increase per year was based on communications with ERCOT staff. She noted that the ERCOT estimate is conservative and does not include costs for upgrades. ERCOT, meanwhile, stood by the estimate in the report. ""It’s the 16 percent by 2030 that’s correct,"" said Robbie Searcy, ERCOT communications manager. Searcy said in a telephone interview that information provided to the House committee ""created a misunderstanding in the congressman’s office and that’s why there was an error."" Our ruling One of PolitiFact’s Truth-O-Meter principles is that words matter, and at the very least, Smith's claim is worded ambiguously. The ERCOT analysis and a news release point to an increase in energy costs of 16 percent by 2030. Smith claims that increase per year",False,"December 17, 2015"

""We're practically not allowed to use coal any more."" There’s a grain of truth here, but it’s buried under significant exaggeration. In August 2015, as we’ve noted, the Obama administration announced Clean Power Plan regulations that would require power plants to reduce carbon emissions, from 2005 levels, by 32 percent by 2030. Advocates say the reduction would help ease global warming along with cutting emissions that create soot and smog. But the regulatory effort has alarmed the coal industry and its allies in Congress. ""This administration’s regulatory assault on coal has had the intention — and increasingly the practical effect — of taking coal out of the market,"" said Luke Popovich, a spokesman for the National Mining Association. (The plan continues to be challenged in court.) Several factors — tighter government regulations, yes, but also lower natural gas prices, and changing consumer and industry preferences — have combined to reduce the amount of coal used for electricity generation by about one-sixth since 2008. But contrary to what Trump asserted, Popovich said, ""coal is not going away."" The U.S. electric power sector consumed 858.3 million tons of coal in 2013, the most recent full year for which Energy Information Administration data is available. It was a little over 1 billion tons in 2008, the last year before the most recent recession. Despite the decline, coal remains the single-most common source for electricity generation in the United States. In 2014, coal accounted for 39 percent of electricity generation, followed by natural gas at 27 percent, nuclear at 19 percent, hydropower at 6 percent, and other renewable sources at 7 percent. In its most recent future projection, the Energy Information Administration predicted that coal would maintain its top spot for electricity generation. Under the most basic economic parameters, coal would decline in future years due in large part to the retirement of aging coal-fired plants but would still account for 34 percent of energy generation in 2040. The enactment of policies that put coal at a disadvantage could drop that percentage further by 2040. Beyond electricity generation, 43.3 million tons of coal were used for other industrial purposes in the United States in 2013, and 2 million tons were allocated to commercial and institutional uses. In other words, coal usage may be slipping, but it’s still in wide use around the country and will continue to be a major source of energy for the next quarter century. ""We ship (coal) to China and they spew it in the air."" China is a major world user of coal, and scientists say its emissions are a major factor in climate change. But very little of the coal produced in the United States goes to China, so any change in United States trade policy would have little effect on China’s coal usage. According to the Energy Information Administration, the U.S. exported 1.8 million tons of coal to China in 2014. That’s less than 2 percent of all U.S. coal exports for that year, which totaled 97.3 million tons to all countries combined. By comparison, the United Kingdom imports more than five times as much U.S. coal as China does. Germany imports more than twice as much U.S. coal as China does, and the Netherlands imports about seven times as much. U.S. coal exports don’t account for much of what China uses, either. While U.S. coal has been gaining market share in Asia in recent years, the Energy Information Administration reported, it comprised less than 4 percent of Asia's coal imports in 2012, and less than 1 percent of total coal consumed by the four biggest Asian importers, which are China, Japan, India and South Korea. And since that figure is for all four countries combined, China’s share is just a fraction of that. The major foreign coal suppliers to China include Australia and Indonesia, Popovich said. The United States’ exports to China are ""very small,"" he said. Our ruling Trump said, ""We're practically not allowed to use coal any more. What do we do with our coal? We ship it to China and they spew it in the air."" He has a point that the Obama administration has worked to reduce the amount of carbon emissions from U.S. sources, including placing additional burdens on power plants that burn coal. But Trump’s language vastly overstates his case. Despite recent declines in coal usage, electric companies in the United States still burned more than 850 million tons of coal in 2014, making it easily the most common energy source for electricity generation. Trump’s point about the U.S. shipping coal to China is even less accurate. U.S. coal exports to China comprise only a tiny fraction of all U.S. coal exports, and U.S. coal accounts for just a tiny fraction of all of the coal that China imports",Mostly False,"December 15, 2015"
"Despite attention on global warming, ""fewer Americans carpool today to work than carpooled in 1980"" and ""SUVs have never been a larger proportion of the vehicles being sold in this country.""","The two-week climate conference now under way in Paris, where President Barack Obama hopes for an international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, has generated attacks from conservatives such as syndicated columnist George Will. On Nov. 30, 2015, the first day of the United Nations gathering, Will made a two-part claim that we want to check. He made the statement on Fox News’ ""Special Report,"" and it was replayed the next day by Milwaukee radio talk show host Charlie Sykes, whose guests are nearly always fellow conservatives. Despite 30 years of ""propaganda"" about global warming, Will stated, ""fewer Americans carpool today to work than carpooled in 1980. SUVs have never been a larger proportion of the vehicles being sold in this country. The American people may profess occasionally to be concerned about global warming, but their behavior tells you that none of this propaganda has had any effect."" The size of the cars Americans drive and how often they carpool are only two ways in which people produce greenhouse gases -- those such as carbon dioxide from vehicles that trap heat in the atmosphere and, scientists believe, contribute to global warming. But let’s see how clean Will’s claim is. Greenhouse gases A little first on greenhouse gases. When Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker stated in September 2015 that the Obama administration’s own Environmental Protection Agency has said its Clean Power Plan ""will have a marginal impact on climate change"" (Half True), we noted that the United States and China are considered the world’s top greenhouse gas polluters. And as PolitiFact National reported the same month, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said it is ""extremely likely"" that humans are causing climate change, and ""very likely"" that greenhouses gases are the driver.   We’ve also noted that according to the EPA, greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles in the United States amount to 27 percent of all sources of greenhouse gases, second only to electric power generation. Now to the first part of Will’s claim. Carpooling The latest census figures show that slightly more than 9 percent of Americans carpooled to work in 2014. As Will suggested, that’s down from nearly 20 percent in 1980, which was the first census to survey about carpooling. Driving alone rose from 64.4 percent to 76.5 percent. Among the reasons, according to experts: The rate of car ownership has risen, work schedules are less predictable, more people work from home and busier Americans want more freedom in managing their commutes with other tasks, such as getting kids to soccer practice. The other part of Will’s statement, however, goes off road a bit. SUVs We’ll note that, strictly speaking, there are traditional sport-utility vehicles, such as the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango, which are built on a truck platform; and the newer crossover-utility vehicles, which are built on a car chassis. They include the Honda CR-V and the Buick Encore. Traditional SUVs peaked with a 17 percent market share in 2002, according to the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based Center for Automotive Research, an independent research group. In 2014, they made up only 7.1 percent of all new vehicle sales. But many people, as well as automotive experts, refer to both types of vehicles simply as SUVs. The car site Edmunds.com told us that SUVs have reached their highest-ever market share in 2015, at 35.5 percent of sales. And the Center for Automotive Research provided us similar figures. In 2014, traditional SUVs and crossovers accounted for 34 percent of new-vehicle sales, as high as any year going back to 1995. Our rating Will said that despite attention on global warming, ""fewer Americans carpool today to work than carpooled in 1980"" and ""SUVs have never been a larger proportion of the vehicles being sold in this country."" Will is correct on carpooling to work and essentially correct on SUVs, when taking into account both traditional SUVs and the smaller crossover vehicles. But it’s worth noting that the market share for the traditional SUVs is down from its peak in 2002",Mostly True,"December 4, 2015"
"Says Ohio Gov. John Kasich ""got lucky with a thing called fracking,"" which ""is why Ohio is doing well.""","In the third Republican debate, Donald Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich got into a fracas over fracking.   It started when debate moderator John Harwood asked Kasich whom he was talking about when Kasich said he’s been hearing ""crazy"" things on the campaign trail. Kasich didn’t name names but listed proposals from the two outsiders leading the GOP field, specifically Trump’s plan to deport 10 million people and Ben Carson’s tithe-based tax policy. ""Folks, we’ve got to wake up. We cannot elect somebody who doesn’t know how to do the job,"" Kasich said on Oct. 28. Trump fired back that Kasich’s record in Ohio wasn’t so good. ""First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, okay?"" Trump retorted. ""He hit oil. He got lucky with fracking. Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well."" ""Ohio does have an energy industry, but we’re diversified,"" Kasich said in response.   Who was right? We reached out to the Trump camp but didn’t hear back. The data suggests and experts told us, however, that Trump is grossly exaggerating fracking’s role in Ohio’s economy. The numbers To refresh, fracking or hydraulic fracturing is the process of blasting pressurized water, sand and chemicals to extract natural gas from shale rock miles underground. Ohio, the birthplace of Standard Oil and the leading producer of crude oil a century ago, sits on parts of two major shale formations. Drilling began in the Utica and Marcellus shales in eastern Ohio in 2010, when the state was facing a projected budget shortfall and when Kasich was elected to office. Ohio is now running a $2 billion surplus. Statistics show that fracking contributed to both jobs and tax revenues in Ohio, but the numbers aren’t overwhelming. Kasich’s spokesperson Rob Nichols pointed to data showing that fracking was responsible for just 2.6 percent of the 278,150 total jobs created in the state during that time period. As for revenue, Nichols said data from Ohio’s Department of Taxation shows that oil and gas industry brought 0.017 percent ($19.89 million) of all state revenue ($118.3 billion) between fiscal years 2014 to 2015. Our own analysis produced similar results. Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we found that fracking accounted for 2.3 to 2.5 percent of all jobs created in Ohio between 2010 and 2014. Factoring in jobs created in related industries (i.e. petrochemical engineering or pipe manufacturing) brings up the figure up to 6.9 to 7.9 percent of all jobs. As for revenue, we looked at Ohio Department of Taxation’s annual reports and found that the severance tax imposed on the oil and gas industry contributed to less than 1 percent of tax revenue in Ohio from 2010 to 2014. Policy Matters Ohio, a Cleveland-based liberal think tank, estimates a slightly lower impact. According to their analysis of BLS data, shale jobs represented about 0.26 percent of total employment in Ohio in the first quarter of 2015, and about 2 percent of total jobs added between 2010 and 2015. By comparison, the auto industry added about three and a half times more jobs. ""I’ll admit that I tweeted in outrage at (Trump’s) statement since both parts of it are inaccurate and not borne out by the data,"" said Amy Hanauer, the think tank’s executive director, who also contends that Ohio is actually not doing well. Shale dreams deferred At the beginning of the fracking boom, the oil and gas industry hailed it as ""the biggest thing economically to hit Ohio since maybe the plow,"" in the words of one executive. Shale development, according to industry officials, would bring an estimated $500 billion and 200,000 jobs to the state. But fracking wasn’t as profitable in Ohio as expected, thanks to a slump in the oil prices coupled with low production. ""I would say the growth has been slower than we originally anticipated,"" an oil refinery official acknowledged in 2012, according to Reuters. ""Nothing like those numbers had been seen,"" said Hanauer. ""Employment even in the drilling counties was, at that time, below pre-recession levels.  Sales tax revenue was up significantly, a good thing, but many of those who have found jobs were from out of state."" A 2012 economic analysis sponsored by pro-industry entities — the Ohio Chamber of Commerce and the Ohio Shale Coalition — estimated that shale development would, by 2014, result in an additional 65,000 jobs and just a 1 percent improvement to the state GDP. The 1 percent estimate was ""pretty much on target,"" according to report co-author Douglas Southgate, a professor emeritus of environmental economics and public policy at Ohio State University who says he’s pro-fracking. The overall employment impact, meanwhile, ""has been small enough that not even OOGA — the Ohio Oil and Gas Association — has been talking about it,"" Southgate told us. Even if oil prices pick up again and fracking’s impact grows, its role in Ohio’s economy wouldn’t be as large as Trump is trumpeting it to be. ""Ohio has a far more diverse economy than, say, North Dakota or Oklahoma,"" said Andrew Thomas of Cleveland State University’s Energy Policy Center, the principal investigator of the 2012 report. ""I am skeptical that all growth in the state can be attributed to the oil and gas industry alone."" Kasich’s campaign forwarded us a report from JobsOhio, the state’s privatized economic development agency, to that point:  For the record, not even the drillers themselves back Trump’s claim. Here’s a statement Shawn Bennett, the executive vice president of the Ohio Oil and Gas Association, provided to PolitiFact: ""While we appreciate Mr. Trump acknowledging the significant and positive economic impacts that oil and gas development has had on Ohio, we can not take credit for all of the economic growth that has taken place during Gov. Kasich's tenure."" Our ruling Trump said, ""John (Kasich) got lucky with a thing called fracking,"" which ""is why Ohio is doing well"". Though Ohio underwent a fracking boom in recent years, Trump is overstating its impact on Ohio’s economy. By all estimates, fracking jobs account for 2 percent of those added in the state during Kasich’s tenure. Shale development has improved GDP by about 1 percent and contributed to less than a percent of the state’s tax revenue. Not even the drillers themselves back Trump’s claim",False,"November 2, 2015"
"""The federal government owns about half of the West, yet it continues to acquire more land.""","GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush has announced he wants a sea change in the federal government’s land management practices. In his Western Land Resource Management plan, which Bush released Oct. 21, 2015, the former Florida governor said federal land holdings are out of control — and therefore, so are expenses and Washington’s influence across the region. ""The federal government owns about half of the West, yet it continues to acquire more land,"" Bush said in the plan, which calls federal holdings ""a liability to economic freedom and growth."" He advocated more state and local control over these lands. Does Washington really own half of Western states, and is it looking for more? We decided to survey this for ourselves. The West vs. Washington There’s no exact total of how much land Washington owns and manages, partly because the total is constantly changing, but it’s a lot. According to the most recent data in a 2012 Congressional Research Service report, the government owns about 635 million to 640 million acres, or about 28 percent of all the land in the country. Most of that land is administered by three agencies in the Department of the Interior: the National Park Service (80 million acres); the Bureau of Land Management (248 million acres); and the Fish and Wildlife Service (89 million acres, plus another 217 million acres of marine refuges and monuments). In the U.S. Agriculture Department, the U.S. Forest Service is in charge of another 193 million acres. The Defense Department runs another 19 million acres in bases, training ranges and more. The rest is divided among several other departments and agencies. There is not an equal split among states, however. To Bush’s point, the federal government owns about 47 percent of the land in 11 Western states — Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. If we head east of the Mississippi River, Washington owns and manages only about 4 percent. This disparity is partly because of history. Most land in the West was at one time public, ranging from purchases from France, Mexico and Russia to land seized from Mexicans and Native Americans. The federal government has transferred land to private interests over the years and has focused on conservation during the last century, but these vast holdings have long been a contentious issue. Many Republicans in Western state legislatures would prefer to keep land-use decisions local. One group called the American Lands Council, headed by Utah Republican state Rep. Ken Ivory, is leading the charge in pushing for transferring federal land to states. The Council did not get back to us for this fact-check, but their website says the group wants federal lands transferred to states to ""provide better public access, better environmental health, and better economic productivity."" Bush’s plan calls for local control and a smaller federal footprint in general. Conservationists and researchers fear the real reason states want these transfers is to sell or lease public lands to private developers for ranching, mining or forestry. This land is our land As Bush says, the federal government is looking to make more acquisitions. His campaign pointed out the Interior and Agriculture departments made a fiscal year 2016 budget request that asked for almost $575 million for land acquisitions (plus $325 million for state conservation grants). The money was earmarked for acquisition projects across several federal agencies that ranged from national park lands to scenic trails to wildlife refuges. That doesn’t necessarily mean those agencies will get that money. The 2016 budget request is dependent on the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a pot of cash pooled from fees on offshore oil and gas leases. Authorized in 1965, the fund is the main mechanism for land purchases and broad conservation efforts. Congress is authorized to set aside as much as $900 million per year from this fund for land acquisition — note the 2016 request is for $900 million in all — but lawmakers rarely give conservation efforts that much. They usually shift the bulk of the money to other expenses and leave little for conservation efforts. Congress authorized $306 million total after a similar $900 million request in 2015. Complicating matters this year is that Congress failed to reauthorize the fund when it expired on Sept. 30. Bush said in his plan he supported a permanent reauthorization of the fund. ""There are additional funding sources for federal land acquisitions, but they are not as significant as LWCF,"" said Martin Nie, director of the Bolle Center for People & Forests at the University of Montana. ""And yes, federal agencies are often in the process of both acquiring more land and conveying (or exchanging) other federal lands."" Greg Zimmerman, policy director at the pro-conservation Center for Western Priorities, also pointed out that total federal acreage has fallen some over the years. That same CRS report concluded the five government agencies we mentioned earlier shed about 18 million acres between 1990 and 2010. Most of that change is from the Bureau of Land Management getting rid of land in Alaska, where the federal government still owns about 62 percent of the state. Our ruling Bush said, ""The federal government owns about half of the west, yet it continues to acquire more land."" He’s right that Washington owns about 47 percent of the land in the 11 most Western states. Government agencies also continue to request funds for land acquisitions, although the major source for these transactions recently expired. The federal government routinely acquires and disposes of land, but overall has less acreage now than it did 25 years ago",Mostly True,"October 27, 2015"
"""In 40 years, 23,000 chemicals came on the market and only four were regulated.""","U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse recently joined Hasbro executives at their downtown headquarters to push a bill to regulate thousands of chemicals, including hazardous substances that pose a risk to children. From behind a blue podium that was as brightly colored and as plastic as a child’s toy, Whitehouse made this claim: ""In 40 years, 23,000 chemicals came on the market and only four were regulated."" This certainly sounded like the Wild West of unregulated chemicals to us: 22,996 chemicals on the market and only four run-ins with regulators? It was clear early on that our fact-checking of the statement would pivot on the definition of ""regulated."" Our dictionary tells us that to ""regulate"" is ""to control or direct by a rule."" Whitehouse’s go-to expert on chemicals, Richard A. Denison, a lead senior scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund, was at the event and provided some immediate clarification after the senator spoke. The EPA blocked four chemicals from the marketplace after the passage of the Toxic Substances Control Act in 1976. That, Denison said, was the regulation Whitehouse was talking about. So almost 23,000 other chemicals went unregulated? That didn’t line up with a 2010 report from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Inspector General. Through September 2008, according to the report, EPA ""regulated 1,432 chemicals by means of Consent Orders."" The consent-order process, which involves negotiations with manufacturers, is quite different from the process that EPA used to block those four chemicals. But it’s a form of government regulation nevertheless — the outcome of a process in which manufacturers of a new chemical must, by rule, file a notice with the government and receive the EPA’s approval. We contacted Whitehouse spokesman Seth Larson for clarification. Larson told us that Whitehouse had been ""speaking off the cuff.""  Larson asked us to consider a somewhat similar statement made in two news releases issued to publicize the Hasbro event. ""In almost 40 years,"" says the news release. ""TSCA has restricted just five chemicals of the more than 80,000 that are in commerce — and even failed to ban asbestos."" The five chemicals referenced in the release are different from the four substances that Whitehouse referred to at the Hasbro podium. The five chemicals were among 62,000 chemicals already in existence in 1976, while the four substances were among chemicals created after the law was passed, according to Denison. Our research into the restriction of ""just five"" substances took us right back to the more than 1,400 chemicals that OIG says EPA regulated through the consent-order process set forth in the 1976 law. The agency, according to its website, can establish conditions for safe use via a ""consent order,"" with the manufacturer agreeing to: toxicity testing, warnings, worker protections, ""restrictions"" on use and releases to ""water, air and land."" But Denison says the orders are negotiated case by case, behind closed doors, and the terms can remain secret or are heavily redacted in the few instances they become public. Still, the 1,400 chemicals have been regulated or restricted in some way. And the EPA even refers to certain negotiated requirements as ""restrictions."" Denison, in a later email, referred us to a collection of comments that high-level EPA officials have made regarding the five particular chemicals Whitehouse cited in the news releases. We noticed that in each case, the EPA officials had qualified their remarks in ways that Whitehouse didn’t. However, from a broader perspective, none of this analysis undercuts Whitehouse’s basic argument that the 1976 law isn’t protecting the public and it needs an overhaul. While many companies have agreed to restrictions under EPA pressure, the overall regulatory environment is extremely lax. Regulators don’t know the toxicity of many chemicals in the marketplace. ""It is important to note that almost 90 percent of pre-manufacture notices submitted to EPA complete the review process without being restricted or regulated in any way,"" the agency says on its website. More than 60 senators have signed on as supporters of the legislation backed by Whitehouse. Hasbro’s chief executive, Brian Goldner, says Hasbro is on a mission ""to make the world a better place for children and their families, and this reform will be a victory."" Our Ruling Whitehouse’s spokesman said the senator used the wrong verb at Hasbro. He asked us to test a different statement that uses a different verb and refers to different facts. We did. In both cases, we found evidence that the number of regulated or restricted chemicals was far greater than the tiny number that Whitehouse and his office referred to in their various statements. Cheryl Hogue, an assistant managing editor at Chemical & Engineering News, agrees that EPA’s regulatory authority is greatly limited by the 1976 law. But she also told us,""Every new chemical that comes on the market has to give a notice to EPA…Is that regulation?,"" she asked. ""A lot of chemical companies would call that regulation."" The 1976 law is weak, and it looks like Congress might make it tougher. But Whitehouse used the wrong verb and he mixed up the facts to make his case for change when he claimed that ""only four"" of 23,000 chemicals ""were regulated",Mostly False,"October 25, 2015"
"To abide by Environmental Protection Agency rules when mining or drilling you have ""to take caution not to disturb bodies of water barely bigger than a puddle.""","On the presidential campaign trail in Ohio, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., called for reversing some of President Barack Obama’s environmental policies and vowed to allow more drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Rubio argued that Environmental Protection Agency rules are too burdensome, pointing to two businesspeople who joined him at his speech, James Mackall, president of Artex Oil, and Tom Mackall, president of East Fairfield Coal. ""The EPA has unilaterally changed how the Clean Water Act is interpreted. Now it not only protects rivers and lakes, but also drainage ditches and private retaining ponds. So when mining or drilling, Jerry and Tom now have to take caution not to disturb bodies of water barely bigger than a puddle."" We wondered: Does the Clean Water Act allow the government to regulate how mining and drilling affects bodies of water ""barely bigger than a puddle?"" A spokesman for Rubio declined to comment. However, Rubio was presumably referring to a recent rule change to the Clean Water Act in which ""puddles"" have emerged as a matter of contention. A Clean Water Act rule change stayed by court First, some background. The Clean Water Act originally passed in 1972, in the wake of a highly publicized incident in which Ohio’s Cuyahoga River caught fire. Another factor that led to the passage of the federal law was a record number of fish kills caused by pollution -- of which the largest was in Florida at Lake Thonotosassa in 1969. Broadly, its goal was to regulate discharges. But which bodies of water should be included has been a hotly contested issue for many years. U.S. Supreme Court rulings in 2001 and 2006 created uncertainty about the law’s reach. EPA officials said those decisions rolled back federal protections for about 60 percent of streams and for millions of acres of wetlands. In May 2015, the EPA announced a new rule intended to clarify which bodies of water fall under the act. The new rule followed months of public comment and took effect on Aug. 28, except in 13 states where a court held up its enactment. Then, earlier this month, a different court held up enactment nationwide. The first thing to know about the new rule is that size doesn’t matter. What matters is whether a body of water can carry pollution into other larger waters. Under the rule, the federal government intends to regulate bodies of water -- including tributaries, ponds, streams, and wetlands -- so that companies or other entities do not dump waste that could flow into larger ecosystems. This definition of a water of federal jurisdiction actually pre-dates the new rule, stemming instead from the Supreme Court cases. In 2001, the court held that the use of ""isolated"" non-navigable intrastate ponds by migratory birds was not by itself a sufficient basis to apply the Clean Water Act. In the 2006 case, Justice Anthony Kennedy concluded that a critical factor in determining whether the Clean Water Act applies is whether a water has a ‘‘significant nexus’’ to traditional navigable waters. So a narrow stream -- even if it dries up for part of the year -- could still fall under federal jurisdiction if it can flow into more significant waters during the rainy season. But an isolated pond that doesn’t connect to other major waters doesn’t fall under the jurisdiction of the act. ""Even if some very small bodies of water may be covered by the Clean Water Act when they are sufficiently connected with another body of water, his statement evokes the image of a small, isolated body of water that would not be covered,"" said Todd Aagaard, vice dean at Villanova law school and former Justice Department environmental lawyer. Even though jurisdiction under the act is determined by connectedness, rather than size, it was the size of water bodies that became a rallying cry for critics who saw the new rule as federal overreach. During the comment period, the regulation of puddles became a talking point for conservatives and business advocates. Presumably for that reason, the final rule explicitly addressed the question of puddles: ""The proposed rule did not explicitly exclude puddles because the agencies have never considered puddles to meet the minimum standard for being a 'water of the United States,' and it is an inexact term. A puddle is commonly considered a very small, shallow, and highly transitory pool of water that forms on pavement or uplands during or immediately after a rainstorm or similar precipitation event. However, numerous commenters asked that the agencies expressly exclude them in a rule. The final rule does so.""  The rule also specifically excludes certain types of water in addition to puddles, including groundwater, most ditches and small ornamental waters, for example. So would it include puddles or anything similar? So if the rule specifically says puddles do not fall under the rule’s jurisdiction, why have critics continued to argue that it encompasses puddles or something not much bigger? We interviewed seven environmental experts, including one who works for an organization that sued the EPA. All of them were skeptical that the rule would cover anything resembling a puddle. That’s because a small body like a puddle, or something a little larger, that doesn’t connect to other waters should have no ultimate impact on the types of navigable waters the Clean Water Act regulates. ""What type of water body is barely bigger than a puddle? How large is the puddle? If he is referring to a small puddle that a kid splashes in, a fair reading of the rule is that it does not cover such an area,"" said Stetson University law professor Royal Gardner, an expert in wetland law and policy. Meanwhile, Rubio specifically mentioned mining and drilling -- two activities that are already highly regulated. While mining and drilling can adversely affect groundwater, the law explicitly excludes groundwater. We reached out to some of the industry groups that have sued the EPA over the rule, including the American Farm Bureau Federation and the U.S Chamber of Commerce. Both argue that the rule language is so broad that it could ultimately include something not much larger than a puddle. Don Parrish, a senior adviser to the federation, pointed to the first footnote in the new rule: ""The agencies use the term ‘water’ and ‘waters’ in categorical reference to rivers, streams, ditches, wetlands, ponds, lakes, oxbows, and other types of natural or man-made aquatic systems, identifiable by the water contained in these aquatic systems or by their chemical, physical, and biological indicators. The agencies use the terms ‘waters’ and ‘water bodies’ interchangeably in this preamble."" To Parrish, this means ""you don’t even need water in them. You just need indicators of chemicals, physical and biological indicators. What in the hell is that? It's very broad."" Asked for real-world examples in which the EPA regulated something roughly the size of a puddle, farm bureau spokesman Will Rodger sent us a photograph of a farm field in Tennessee that appears to show the beginning of a nearly dry stream. He said that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers declared this swath of land as ""waters of the United States"" by virtue of being a tributary. (This occurred in 2014 before the new rule took effect.) Environmental experts we checked with said that water on land that appears even during only part of the year can end up flowing to larger bodies of water. But again, the key is that the water must be poised to flow into other significant waters, which seems distinct from a small, isolated puddle. ""It’s true that headwaters of streams are small, but small rivulets goes into a river,"" said Karl Coplan, of Pace law school. ""The whole point of the Clean Water Act is to cover that river up to the point where it starts."" Environmental experts, for their part, said they could not think of any examples in which the EPA attempted to regulate something barely bigger than a puddle. ""It is an absurd assertion, said William L. Andreen, University of Alabama law professor. ""There are no cases on point because the agencies have never asserted jurisdiction in such fantastical situations."" Our ruling Rubio said that to abide by EPA rules when mining or drilling you have ""to take caution not to disturb bodies of water barely bigger than a puddle."" A new final rule -- currently on hold due to lawsuits -- does seek to clarify what types of bodies of water the EPA can oversee through the Clean Water Act. But the rule explicitly excludes puddles, along with most ditches and ornamental bodies of water. In addition, the key factor for determining Clean Water Act jurisdiction is how connected a body of water is, not how big or small it is. To the extent that a puddle, or something slightly larger, shouldn’t be a ""significant"" contributor to bigger, navigable waters located far away -- a standard set by the 2006 Supreme Court decision -- it should not be subject to regulation under the new rule.

"""Fifteen out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world"" are in India and China.","Former Sen. Jim Webb, D-Va., spent most of the first Democratic presidential debate in the shadow of frontrunners Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. But he got in a few shots here and there. During the debate, Webb discussed the issue of climate change, arguing that the United States can’t go it alone. ""We are not going to solve climate change simply with the laws here,"" Webb said. ""We've done a good job in this country since 1970. If you look at China and India, they're the greatest polluters in the world. Fifteen out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world are in one of those two countries. We need to solve this in a global way. It's a global problem."" We decided to check whether Webb is right that ""15 out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world"" are in India and China, and whether his point is relevant for the climate change debate. (Webb’s staff did not respond to an inquiry.) The top-20 list There is indeed a credible top-20 list for most-polluted cities. It was assembled by the World Health Organization in 2014. It compares cities based on how much fine particulate matter they have in the air. This measurement is called PM 2.5, standing for particulate matter that is 2.5 microns in width or smaller. (There are about 25,000 microns per inch, so these particles are very small.) Such pollutants at the ground level pose such immediate health risks as eye, nose, throat and lung irritation, and they can elevate the risk for lung and heart ailments over the longer term. These small particles typically come from exhaust from cars, trucks, buses and other vehicles, though they can also come from natural sources such as forest and grass fires. Here’s the list: Rank CIty and country PM 2.5 pollution level 1 Delhi, India 153 2 Patna, India 149 3 Gwalior, India 144 4 Raipur, India 134 5 Karachi, Pakistan 117 6 Peshawar, Pakistan 111 7 Rawalpindi, Pakistan 107 8 Khormabad, Iran 102 9 Ahmedabad, India 100 10 Lucknow, India 96 11 Firozabad, India 96 12 Doha, Qatar 93 13 Kanpur, India 93 14 Amritsar, India 92 15 Ludhiana, India 91 16 Idgir, Turkey 90 17 Narayonganj, Bangladesh 89 18 Allahbad, India 88 19 Agra, India 88 20 Khanna, India 88 So, 13 of the 20 cities on the most-polluted list are located in India (they’re highlighted in bold). That’s two fewer cities than Webb had said, and none of the 20 cities on the list are located in China, as he’d indicated. Still, Webb’s not that far off, and he has a point that the list is dominated by developing countries, including many in south Asia. The relevance of this finding for climate change It’s important to note, however, that particulate pollution is not a key contributor to climate change. Rising global temperatures are more heavily tied to emissions of another substance -- carbon dioxide. Webb’s comment ""does seem to conflate two issues,"" said John Reilly, co-director of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Looking at the U.S. experience over the past few decades can help clarify the difference between the two metrics. ""The U.S. cleaned up emission of particulates and sulfate aerosols by requiring cleaner, lower-sulfur coal and cleaner diesel fuel,"" Reilly said. ""But cleaning up those emissions does nothing directly to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, since we continued to use coal and petroleum products."" Ironically, particulate emissions may actually have a cooling effect rather than a warming effect because they can reflect sunlight back into space, said Brian Soden, a professor in atmospheric sciences at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. This reflectiveness may have made the earth warm more slowly than it might otherwise have. That said, experts agreed that there’s likely a reasonably high correlation between cities that have high particulate counts and those that have high emission levels for carbon dioxide, particularly when you look beyond advanced industrialized nations like the United States. While ""the two lists will not necessarily line up perfectly, the 20 most polluted cities are certainly also top contributors of carbon emissions,"" Soden said. And experts said that Webb does have a point about the need for international cooperation if carbon levels are to be cut. While the United States is a bigger carbon emitter right now, other nations like India are seeing their emissions rise more rapidly. Emissions are only going to fall worldwide if most major emitters reduce their output together. ""Yes, it is absolutely a global problem, but someone needs to lead,"" Soden said. Our ruling Webb said that ""15 out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world"" are in India and China. He’s close -- 13 are in India, though none are in China. It’s worth pointing out, however, that the top-20 list measures cities with the greatest level of particulate pollution, which is not the same thing as emissions of carbon dioxide, the primary driver of climate change",Mostly True,"October 15, 2015"
"Says U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson ""led the fight to let polluters release unlimited amounts of carbon pollution and took nearly $225,000 from polluters.""","Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson is once again in the crosshairs of a national conservation group for his voting record. The League of Conservation Voters has run a series of television ads against Johnson, a first-term senator who is facing a 2016 rematch with Democrat Russ Feingold. The ads have aired in anticipation of possible action by Republicans in Congress to undo Obama Administration regulations limiting carbon emissions. The $1.6 million campaign includes an ad called ""Disappear,"" and another dubbed ""Lakes."" Both make variations of the same claim: That ""Ron Johnson led the fight to let polluters release unlimited amounts of carbon pollution."" The second ad includes this addendum: ""... and took nearly $225,000 from polluters."" Turns out the environmental groups are doing a bit of recycling. Support for the legislation We checked a similar claim in 2013 when the League of Conservation Voters aired an ad that said Johnson had taken ""more than $100,000 from oil and gas and voted to let them keep spewing unlimited carbon pollution into our air."" We rated the claim True. Johnson voted twice to prohibit the EPA from regulating any carbon emissions. And, at the time that ad aired, he had received $109,550 from oil and gas interests since his first campaign in 2010, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign contributions. The same votes are cited in the most recent ads. But the wording varies a bit. It says Johnson ""led the fight,"" which is problematic. The group’s backup for the ad cites two measures that Johnson voted in favor of -- one in 2011 and one in 2013 -- that would have blocked the EPA from strengthening the carbon emission standards. However, he was not a sponsor or co-sponsor of either amendment, so it’s hard to consider him a leader. The group also noted Johnson ""has co-sponsored legislation, written to President Obama, and spoken to the media regarding his opposition to the Clean Power Plan."" The bill the group cites, the Affordable Reliable Energy Now Act, was introduced May 13, 2015. Johnson is among 35 co-sponsors. That’s nearly two-thirds of the 54 senators who are Republican. The letter cited was written to Obama June 4, 2014. It called on him to withdraw the EPA carbon rules. Johnson was one of 41 Republican senators who signed. Finally, the group cites a quote from Johnson in a June 18, 2014 article posted by the liberal blog Talking Points Memo. In it, Johnson said he'd be ""totally supportive"" of using government funding legislation to block the EPA rules. ""I'm a manufacturer. You actually need power if you're going to manufacture things,"" he said. ""Let's not drive, artificially, the cost of power up -- that's a self-inflicted wound. That's what this administration is doing and I have no idea why they'd want to do that."" He was one of a half dozen GOP senators quoted in the story. So, while Johnson took the steps, the group provides little evidence he was out in front or somehow spearheading them. Campaign contributions Finally, the ad offers a new figure for campaign cash (nearly $225,000) and instead of ""oil and gas,"" describes the contributors as ""polluters."" According to same campaign contribution database we previously reviewed, Johnson received  $133,600 from the oil and gas industry, $63,428 from the mining, and $22,700 from electric power utilities. That tallies out to $219,728. Johnson campaign spokesman Brian Reisinger called the ads a ""false partisan attack"" and said they distorted Johnson’s position ""that we can protect our economy and environment at the same time with a balanced national energy policy."" Our rating The League of Conservation voters launched TV ads that claim Johnson ""led the fight to let polluters release unlimited amounts of carbon pollution and took nearly $225,000 from polluters."" Much of the ad’s content is recycled. The claim, however, is puffed up a bit this time because it says Johnson ""led"" the effort.

"Says ""the cascading effects"" of climate change contributed to the rise of ISIS.","""Absurd,"" ""embarrassing,"" and ""brazenly silly"" were some of the insults hurled at Democratic presidential candidate Martin O’Malley when he suggested in July that climate change contributed to the rise of ISIS. Despite the derision, the former governor of Maryland continues to stand by his talking point. ""One of the things that preceded the failure of the nation-state of Syria and the rise of ISIS was the effect of climate change and the mega-drought that affected that region, wiped out farmers, drove people to cities, created a humanitarian crisis,"" O’Malley told Bloomberg TV on July 20. Two months later, O’Malley repeated his argument in an interview with the progressive radio show Democracy Now! on Sept. 10: ""Their government could not take care of the basic needs of families in those conditions. Civil war rose up as a result of protest and repression ... then the vacuum to that led to ISIS. So these are the cascading effects that happen in a world that’s very, very connected and in a world where climate change is now creating extreme weather conditions, prolonged droughts."" With recent events -- the pope’s visit highlighting climate change and the United States’ decision to accept more Syrian refugees -- converging on the topic, we were curious if O’Malley’s claim really was ""absurd."" O’Malley’s source A spokesperson for the O’Malley campaign told us that his source was a March 2015 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study, which was well received in its field, does not mention ISIS at all, but its authors told us O’Malley’s extrapolation makes sense. The study found evidence that climate change led to an extreme drought in Syria’s breadbasket between 2006 to 2009. Food prices skyrocketed, nutrition-related diseases became widespread, and 1.5 million internal refugees abandoned their farms and flooded into Syrian cities already crowded with 1.5 million Iraqi refugees displaced by the Iraq war, according to the study. This influx of people exacerbated existing problems like unemployment, corruption and brewing discontent with the regime of Bashar al-Assad, which failed to respond to the situation, according to the study. In 2011, the unrest reached boiling point and erupted into the Syrian uprising. If we follow the sequence of events like O’Malley does, it’s reasonable to say the next fallen domino is the rise of ISIS. ""Once the war had begun all sorts of pre-existing actors took advantage of the situation to pursue their goals -- ISIS was one and the collapse of Syria provided fertile ground for their actions,"" said co-author Richard Seager, a professor of climatology at Columbia University. O’Malley’s campaign also forwarded us many reports and comments from the Department of Defense linking climate change and ISIS. We should also note that the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences study is not the first rigorous, academic investigation into the links between climate change and conflict (there’s at least one other on the Syrian conflict alone). Drought’s not the sole culprit In the grander scheme of things, experts say, the drought was just one of many sparks that set the Syrian powder keg ablaze. But both the study and O’Malley acknowledge that and get credit for not overstating climate change’s impact. While climate change may have played an indirect role in the Syrian uprising and ISIS’ rise, other causes – Assad’s recruitment of al-Qaeda members, the genocide against Sunni Arabs, etc.– are direct and ""crystal clear,"" according to Ali Khedery, a former special assistant to five American ambassadors in Iraq. Michael Doran, a senior fellow on Middle East security issues at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank, pointed out that unrest in region is not confined to areas suffering from drought. He, however, said that O’Malley’s correct that the drought played a role in generating disaffection.   ""The drought did not cause the Syrian revolution or the fall of Assad,"" said Kenneth Pollack, a senior fellow on Middle East policy at the Brookings Institution. ""A very complex mix of factors did that, but the study suggests that climate change was part of that mix even if we can't tell how important it was."" The study, which Pollack said is garnering a lot of attention among Middle East experts, notes that there is no single cause for conflict, while O’Malley emphasized the ""cascading effects"" of the drought, rather than the drought itself. ""It's fair to say the uprising was going to happen at some point. But the drought did happen when it happened and based on the timing of it, the agricultural collapse and the migration were direct results,"" said study lead author Colin Kelley, a climatologist at the University of California at Santa Barbara. ""The drought creating this chaotic situation also created better opportunity for ISIS to thrive. If you say that in the way (O’Malley) said, it's fair to argue."" Our ruling O’Malley argued that ""the cascading effects"" of climate change contributed to the rise of ISIS The O’Malley campaign referred us to a credible March 2015 study that supports his point. According to the study, a drought in Syria in the 2000s displaced millions of refugees and added to discontent that eventually erupted into war. While the study does not mention ISIS by name, the authors say O’Malley is simply taking their argument one step further. Experts agreed that the drought, spurred by climate change, was one of many factors that led to the Syrian conflict. O’Malley’s phrasing suggests he understands this and is careful not overstate it",Mostly True,"September 23, 2015"
"The Obama administration’s ""own Environmental Protection Agency"" has said its Clean Power Plan ""will have a marginal impact on climate change.""","When the second Republican presidential debate took up climate change, Gov. Scott Walker made a counterintuitive claim about President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which requires the nation’s power plans to reduce their carbon emissions by nearly a third. About midway into the Sept. 16, 2015 debate, held in California, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida was expressing concerns to moderator Jake Tapper about higher utility rates and fewer jobs. That's when Walker interjected and said: ""A lot of those people, though, and I'm going to echo what Senator Rubio just said. This is an issue where, we're talking about my state, it's thousands of manufacturing jobs. Thousands of manufacturing jobs for a rule the Obama administration, (its) own EPA has said will have a marginal impact on climate change."" Walker’s campaign confirmed to us that the governor was referring to the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan, and to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. There are differences of opinion, of course, over how much one plan in one country can affect the global climate. But to Walker’s claim: Did the EPA -- the agency administering the Clean Power Plan -- say the plan’s regulations would have only a marginal effect on climate change? The plan In August 2015, the Obama administration announced that its Clean Power Plan regulations would require power plants to reduce carbon emissions, from 2005 levels, by 32 percent by 2030. (A 2014 draft of the plan had sought a 30 percent reduction.) Advocates said the reduction would help attack global warming and provide reductions in other emissions that create soot and smog. But the announcement prompted Walker to add Wisconsin to states that are challenging the first-ever requirements in court. The reductions won't be uniform, because individual states rely on different mixes of coal, natural gas, nuclear energy, water, wind and the sun to provide power. Wisconsin, which has traditionally relied heavily on coal, faces having to reduce emissions 34 percent-- the sixth-highest rate in the country, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. EPA’s view As for the the EPA, it has described the Clean Power Plan as a necessary, though not sufficient, step in addressing climate change -- and as part of a larger strategy to spur other nations to reduce emissions. During a July 2015 congressional hearing, U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, challenged EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy on the impact on climate change. The Texas Republican quoted a former EPA assistant secretary under Obama as saying the plan would, at most, reduce the global temperature by 1/100 of a degree Celsius. McCarthy responded by saying that the value of the plan can’t be measured that way. She said that while the plan mandates carbon emission reductions in the United States, it also aims to prod other nations to reduce their emissions and to trigger investment in technological innovations that also will reduce emissions. The value of the plan is ""in showing strong domestic action, which can actually trigger global action,"" McCarthy said. ""(I’m) not disagreeing that this action in and of itself will not make all the difference we need to address climate action. But what I'm saying is if don't take action domestically, we will never get started."" (Separately, EPA spokeswoman Liz Purchia told us the agency has said the Clean Power Plan ""is only one component of our larger strategy,"" which includes measures for vehicle fuel efficiency and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.) During the same hearing, there were fears expressed that the plan will drive up the cost of electricity to consumers. And U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., expressed concern that China, India and Russia would not reduce the growth in their carbon emissions. So, the head of the EPA acknowledges that the Clean Power Plan -- since it applies only to the United States -- can have only a limited impact on global climate change. But besides reducing carbon emissions in the United States, the plan is aimed at getting other nations to do the same. Other views We interviewed two experts about the Clean Power Plan and the EPA’s take on it: Adele Morris of the Brookings Institution’s Climate and Energy Economics Project, and Chip Knappenberger of the Cato Institute’s Center for the Study of Science. Both agreed that the United States historically is a major emitter of carbons, but growing nations such as India and China will play a larger role in future emissions. And they agreed that a key part of the EPA’s strategy with the Clean Power Plan is that as a global leader, if the United States reduces emissions, other nations might be spurred to do so, as well. Other experts have made the same point. ""This appears to be an intentionally obfuscating perspective,"" Dallas Burtraw, a senior fellow at Resources for the Future a think tank that tracks energy policy, said of Walker's claim. ""Climate change is a global problem. The contribution of U.S. efforts are greater, in my mind, for the influence they have on the behavior of the other nations of the world than for the specific reductions that the U.S. achieves. The greater contribution is leadership in this case."" In June 2015 -- five months before a United Nations summit meeting aimed at forging a global accord to cut climate-warming emissions -- China submitted a plan to the U.N. detailing how it plans to reduce fossil fuel emissions by 2030. The New York Times reported that climate policy experts cited the significance of China’s plan, given that the United States and China -- the world’s top greenhouse gas polluters -- have long been viewed as the biggest obstacles to reaching a meaningful global warming deal. Our rating In the debate, Walker said the Obama administration’s ""own Environmental Protection Agency"" has said its Clean Power Plan ""will have a marginal impact on climate change."" The EPA acknowledges that the plan can have only a limited effect on global climate change, given that they order reductions in carbon emission only in the United States. But a key aim of the plan is to spur other nations to reduce their emissions, as well, and to spur new technologies that will help reduce emissions",Half True,"September 21, 2015"
"""There has never been a panther attack in the history of Florida.""","A state wildlife official opposed plans to alter protections for the Florida panther, saying there was no pressing reason to fear the big cats. On Sept. 2, 2015, the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission considered a policy proposal that critics said would have undercut efforts to expand the population. Opponents said the proposal favored ranchers, who have complained about panthers eating livestock and potentially threatening family members. Commissioner ""Alligator"" Ron Bergeron said he’d never had reason to be afraid of a panther. ""I’ve been within three yards of panthers, multiple times,"" said Bergeron, a Broward County paving contractor who has been a commissioner since 2007. ""There has never been a panther attack in the history of Florida."" (Watch his comments here, at the 3:10 mark.) The commission voted 4-1 to approve the proposal, with Bergeron casting the lone vote against it. The group agreed to change the plan the next day, adding language Bergeron wanted to clarify the state would continue working with the federal government using ""available staff and budgetary resources."" The overall proposal still said the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and not the state, will take the lead on efforts to grow the panther population in central and north Florida. We got to wondering, was he right about the felines never attacking a person? Well, none that anyone can prove. Panther primer Florida panthers are a subspecies of cougar that once roamed across the state. A male panther requires about 200 miles of open territory to thrive, so human expansion and development in Florida devastated the cat population. Since panthers historically prey on white-tailed deer and other animals, livestock often are a substitute. Ranchers would routinely shoot the cats until the animals became protected from hunting in 1958. The federal government declared panthers an endangered species in 1967, and the state did the same in 1973. By then there were as few as 20 to 30 panthers left. They’ve rebounded since then to between 100 and 180, but that doesn’t mean everything is great. A record 30 cats were killed in 2014, most by cars in Collier and Hendry counties. The panthers also had killed a record number of livestock and pets that year. While farm animals fare poorly when panthers are about, the cats usually give humans a wide berth. A Conservation Commission spokeswoman backed up Bergeron, confirming to PolitiFact Florida that in modern times, there had never been a verified panther attack on a human in the state. That’s the wide consensus, and is a part of the agency’s website and literature — even in a handout that says what to do to if a panther attacks. We should note there have been cougar (or puma, or mountain lion, or whatever you want to call them) attacks on people in other parts of the country. For example, a 35-year-old man was killed by a mountain lion while working on his bicycle in a wilderness park in Orange County, Calif., in 2004. The same cat attacked and injured a 30-year-old woman biking in the same area later that day. In 2008, a mountain lion killed a 55-year-old man close to his home near Pinos Altos, N.M. University of Florida wildlife ecology professor Madan Oli had not heard of any panther ever attacking anyone in Florida. ""I am not aware of any documented/verified case of a Florida panther attacking humans,"" Oli said in an email. ""I think one can safely say that such an attack has not happened in this century, but I cannot say when the last attack – if it ever happened – took place."" The part about verifying an attack is what makes the claim tricky. Even an attack near Lake Kissimmee in 2014 couldn’t be verified, because the alleged victim waited three weeks to report it. Gary Mormino, professor emeritus at the University of South Florida-St. Petersburg Florida Studies program, said word of panther attacks used to routinely fill the newspapers. One particularly harrowing account from 1899 said a man named F.D. Biggs was on a picnic with his wife and 2-year-old when a ""big catamount,"" a common alternative description for panthers, attacked the child. ""The cat bit Mr. Smith terribly on the arm, and, fastening its claws in his clothing, tore his coat and shirt almost completely from his body,"" the article read. Biggs allegedly choked the animal to death and displayed its body in his Thonotosassa store. Mormino’s research showed that accounts of attacks appeared in the media up through the 1960s, in local papers and the New York Times. Whether they are reliable is a different question. ""I am struck as to how many late 19th- and early 20th-century century stories involve panther attacks and humans,"" Mormino told PolitiFact Florida. ""And I am sure these figures from the past who claimed to have been attacked by panthers were speaking the truth, for them. As to the scientific truth, I simply do not know and yield to the experts."" Our ruling Bergeron said, ""There has never been a panther attack in the history of Florida."" While that’s the official stance of the state’s fish and wildlife agency, saying ""never"" is perhaps overstating the case a bit. There historically have been accounts of people tangling with the big cats. But many of those stories come from newspaper articles that date back a century or more. Wildlife experts agree that in modern times, there have been no verified panther attacks on a person in Florida. Bergeron would have been better served if he had used the words ""verified panther attack",Mostly True,"September 8, 2015"

"The Obama administration is ""proposing to mine another 10 billion tons of Wyoming coal, which would unleash three times more carbon pollution than Obama's Clean Power Plan would even save through 2030.""","President Barack Obama is playing an environmental joke on us, according to a video by progressive activist group Credo Action. This week, Obama traveled to Alaska to promote his climate change agenda. But some environmental activists see the visit as hypocritical, considering some of his other policy decisions, such as permitting oil drilling in the Arctic. To highlight what it sees as contradictory policies, Credo Action released an annotated version of a White House video promoting the Alaska trip. Credo’s video says Obama’s trip is antithetical to some of his own policies, including ""proposing to mine another 10 billion tons of Wyoming coal, which would unleash three times more carbon pollution than Obama's Clean Power Plan would even save through 2030."" Credo is right that mining 10 billion tons of coal in quick order would more than negate any carbon reductions from Obama’s EPA plan. There’s just one problem: There’s no proposal to mine 10 billion tons of coal. What proposal? Credo’s source is a 2015 report by Greenpeace, another progressive environmental activist group. The report references the federal coal lease program, by which the government leases public lands to private companies for coal mining. The report said that a field office of the Bureau of Land Management in Buffalo, Wy., is proposing several new leases that would amount to 10.2 billion tons of coal. Greenpeace estimated that burning all 10.2 billion tons would result in almost 17 billion tons of carbon pollution. That dwarfs what the Environmental Protection Agency says Obama's Clean Power Plan will cut in carbon emissions. According to the EPA, the Clean Power Plan will reduce carbon emissions in the power sector by about 870 million tons annually by 2030. Greenpeace used a National Resources Defense Council estimate of the cumulative emission reductions through 2030 -- 5.3 billion tons. Greenpeace’s carbon pollution calculation is reasonable, said Michael Mann, executive director of the Institute for Energy Studies at the University of North Dakota. Roughly 2.4 pounds of carbon are produced per pound of subbituminous coal (found in Wyoming) burned. The problem is that this 10.2 billion new tons of coal proposal is nonexistent. Greenpeace -- and others who have quoted this figure -- are distorting a single line buried in a 3,000-page report. In May 2015, the Wyoming field office released a resource management plan, which says the bureau ""has estimated that it would issue 28 coal leases encompassing 106,400 acres with approximately 10.2 billion tons of coal...over the next 20 years."" But this is not a proposal or prediction. This is an outer-bounds estimate generated solely for the purposes of analysis, bureau spokeswoman Kristen Lenhardt told PolitiFact. The figures refer to the maximum amount of development possible within the 20-year lifespan of the resource management plan. The many regulatory steps that happen before land is offered for a coal lease, as well as shifts in market demand, would affect the actual amount of land available. ""It was not a plan for how much coal may, or may not be, leased in future years,"" she said. ""It is highly unlikely that actual development during the period of the plan will be anywhere close to this number of leases or acres."" Also noteworthy is the fact that the resource management plan did not designate any new lands for coal lease consideration. These 106,400 acres identified by the report were already categorized as lands that could be available for mining. Even if this were a real proposal, Credo’s timeline is unrealistic. It assumes that all 10 billion tons of Wyoming coal would be burned by 2030, which would require a staggering increase in coal use. The country has consumed around 1 billion tons of coal annually in recent years, and that’s including coal produced all over the country, not just Wyoming. There are not nearly enough power plants in the country for this to work, Mann said. The United States has fewer than 520 coal-fired plants, and that number is on the decline. ""If we replaced all of the coal that is currently burned with this new coal from Wyoming, we still would not use that much coal,"" Mann said. Our ruling A video by Credo Action said the Obama administration is ""proposing to mine another 10 billion tons of Wyoming coal, which would unleash three times more carbon pollution than Obama's Clean Power Plan would even save through 2030."" Burning 10 billion tons of coal over the next 15 years would unleash more carbon pollution than the federal clean energy regulations expect to save in the same period of time. However, burning that much coal in that timeframe is unrealistic, and, more importantly, the government has not made such a proposal. Rather, the 10 billion tons figure refers to an estimate -- developed solely for analysis -- of the maximum amount of coal that could be available for mining in a particular region of Wyoming over the next 20 years",Mostly False,"September 1, 2015"
"On unemployment rates: ""We have counties in Southwest Virginia that are well into double digits and some that are pushing 20 percent.""","One speaker after another railed against the Environmental Protection Agency during a recent meeting of the Virginia chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group founded by billionaire industrialists David and Charles Koch. Among the critics was Del. Israel O’Quinn, R-Washington County, who traveled about 320 miles from his district in the southwest corner of Virginia to the Aug. 10 event at the University of Richmond. He warned that new EPA regulations curbing carbon emissions will pound the already wounded coal-producing counties in his district. ""Virginia’s unemployment rate is not spectacular right now, regardless of what the governor would have you believe,"" O’Quinn said. ""Now in Southwest Virginia, we have counties that are much, much higher. ""We have counties in Southwest Virginia that are well into double digits and some that are pushing 20 percent unemployment. Twenty percent, that’s not an insignificant number and you can track almost every single one of those to the coal industry because when coal takes a downswing, the entire economy of Southwest Virginia takes a big lick right along with it."" No doubt, the coal industry has seen better days and plays a vital role in Southwest Virginia’s economy. But we wondered whether counties in the region really are experiencing unemployment rates ""well into the double digits"" with some ""pushing 20 percent."" We defined Southwest Virginia based on a map published by the Center for Economic Education at Radford University. The region stretches from Lee County in the corner of the state to Roanoke County. It includes 19 counties and six cities. According to the Virginia Employment Commission’s latest statistics, the state had a seasonally unadjusted unemployment rate of 5 percent in June. The rate was 6.1 percent in Southwest Virginia. None of the counties or cities in the region had unemployment rates that came anywhere close to ""pushing 20 percent,"" as O’Quinn said. Two counties were in low double digits: Buchanan at 11.1 percent and Dickenson at 10.2 percent. In third place was Wise County, with 9.2 percent unemployment. It’s notable that Buchanan, Dickenson and Wise have the highest unemployment rates in the region because they are the three largest coal-producing counties in Virginia and, according to VEC data, are home to about 80 percent of the state’s coal miners. In 1990, the three counties had 9,773 coal mining jobs. That plummeted to an average of 2,812 jobs last year. Coal mining also has steadily declined in Kentucky and West Virginia during recent decades, and experts cite several key reasons: increased competition from cheap shale gas and and from less expensive, low-sulfur coal out west, particularly Wyoming’s Powder River Basin; increased automation in coal mining; increased regulations from the EPA. Getting back to O’Quinn, it’s clear that the unemployment rate is high in Virginia’s three largest coal counties, but not as bad as the delegate described. When we asked O’Quinn for the source of his numbers, he sent us a map from the VEC confirming the county unemployment rates we’ve detailed and he told us he misspoke. He said he meant to say that ""underemployment"" was pushing 20 percent in some coal counties. Underemployment occurs when a person holds a job that is below his training and doesn’t meet his financial needs. Neither the VEC nor the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics measures underemployment for Virginia counties. O’Quinn told us many local government officials in his district ""anecdotally"" believe ""underemployment there ""could absolutely be as high as 20 percent."" O’Quinn also said that since the release of June unemployment figures, coal companies in his district have filed federal notices that they are planning to lay off more workers. U.S. law requires most companies with 100 or more employees to provide 60 days notification in advance of layoffs. Records show one such notification, called a WARN notice, has been filed by a coal company in Virginia this year. On July 8, Alpha Natural Resources said it will lay off 165 Virginia workers on Sept. 6. Our ruling O’Quinn said, ""We have counties in Southwest Virginia that are well into double digits and some that are pushing 20 percent unemployment."" He offered the statistics at a rally where speakers were trying to muster opposition to new EPA carbon restrictions by arguing, in part, the rules will accelerate the decline in coal mining jobs. There is no county in the region that comes close to a 20 percent unemployment rate and it’s debatable whether any are ""well into double digits."" The highest June unemployment rates were in Virginia’s three biggest coal counties: Buchanan, 11.1 percent; Dickenson, 10.2 percent; and Wise, 9.2 percent. Those are big numbers. But McQuinn, who acknowledges he misspoke, exaggerated them",False,"August 17, 2015"
"Austin is ""effectively"" imposing ""a ban on barbecue restaurants.""","Conservative Rush Limbaugh told listeners that liberal Austin has moved toward wiping out local barbecue joints. On his July 28, 2015, program, the commentator read from a web post stating the Austin City Council in April 2015 ""passed a preliminary plan"" restricting smoke from barbecue restaurants. Limbaugh said the web post went on to say the contemplated requirement that restaurants install costly devices to diffuse smoke led a business expert to tell council members ""these restrictions will certainly kill all but the largest barbecue restaurants in Austin."" ""It is effectively a ban on barbecue restaurants in a town known for its barbecue,"" Limbaugh echoed. What ""kind of an absurd requirement is this anyway?"" he added. Smoke pouring from commercial barbecue smokers has been a hot Austin topic, in particular pitting a new South Austin restaurant against nearby homeowners who say its smoke wafting their way has reduced the value of their homesteads. And did the council adopt a plan amounting to a ban on ‘cue restaurants? Citing a website Limbaugh, according to a transcript of his program, recited as fact a July 25, 2015, web post on IAmATexan.com, headlined ""Austin City Council Votes to Ban BBQ Restaurants."" That post said the council had passed a preliminary plan to restrict smoke from barbecue restaurants, continuing: ""The city council’s current proposal will require smoke diffusers and will also limit the amount of time that restaurants can smoke. These restrictions will require at least $100,000 in extra investments for most barbecue restaurants as they will be forced to buy extra smokers along with severely expensive diffusers, and in some cases will have to lease or purchase more property. ""One business expert told council members that these restrictions will certainly kill all but the largest barbecue restaurants in Austin. ""It is effectively a ban on barbecue restaurants in a town known for its barbecue."" We didn’t connect with the unnamed authors of that post. Nor did our query to Limbaugh draw a reply. But Austin American-Statesman news stories, City of Austin documents and responses by a city spokeswoman indicate that after the council talked about imposing controls to reduce unwanted smoke from restaurant smokers, members directed the city manager, Marc Ott, to gather public input and make recommendations. As of late July 2015, city spokeswoman Alicia Dean said, one City Council committee had recommended no citywide restrictions while another council panel, slated to reconvene Aug. 3, 2015, had not made a recommendation. Limbaugh’s claim, Dean said, is not true. Blowing smoke in Austin Let’s scrape up the details--which extend to the city pulling together this 2015 document delivering a breakdown of Austin barbecue trailers and restaurants and the hours each one operates a smoker (around the clock to three times daily ""for flavor"" to not at all). After Terry Black’s Barbecue opened, on Barton Springs Road just south of Lady Bird Lake, nearby neighbors objected to smoke from its pit blowing into their yards and homes--not every day, residents initially said, but often enough depending on prevailing winds. Mike Black said in a January 2015 statement to the American-Statesman that he intended to work with residents to address concerns. In July 2015, residents filed a lawsuit against the restaurant. Credit for publicly suggesting the city regulate smoke from restaurants belongs to Austin City Council Member Sabino ""Pio"" Renteria, whose idea to require smoke mitigation wasn’t embraced by pitmasters who said purchasing expensive ""smoke scrubbers"" could kill barbecue stands inside the city limits. ""It will force 99 percent of Austin BBQ places to either close or move out of town,"" John Mueller of John Mueller Meat Co. said in a statement. In March 2015, Renteria said he was revising his original proposal to have it apply only to restaurants and mobile food vendors within 100 feet of residential property—down from 150 feet. He also said he wanted to look at other smoke-mitigating options besides scrubbers. At a March 31, 2015, work session, council members questioned how regulating smoke emissions would affect small businesses and longtime businesses, and whether there might be a way to target regulations at new businesses or ones that had been the subject of complaints. The Statesman reported that the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality in 2014 received two complaints about odor and smoke coming from Terry Black’s Barbecue, and one complaint in 2014 and another in 2015 about an East Austin establishment, la Barbecue. In all cases, the agency determined the odor and smoke were not nuisances subject to state intervention, commission spokeswoman Andrea Morrow said, adding that a nuisance would have to ""be injurious to or adversely affect human health, welfare, animal life, vegetation or property"" or ""interfere with normal use and enjoyment of animal life, vegetation, or property."" On April 2, 2015, council members voted 9-2 to gather input from neighbors and businesses in the lead-up to a ""possible"" writing of smoke-control rules. The issue was to go first to the Economic Opportunity and Health and Human Services committees, both consisting of council members. Specifically, the council’s resolution said members were initiating a possible amendment to the city code to address smoke from cookers, restaurants and trucks and their impact on residences with provisions to be considered including a requirement that restaurants and mobile vendors using a wood- or charcoal-burning stove or grill and located within 100 feet of a property used or zoned as a residence ""take appropriate action to mitigate the impact of smoke emissions"" on the lives of nearby residents ""by relocating smoke-emitting equipment"" or ""installing smoke-mitigating devices."" The resolution also directed Ott to gather input from affected residents, business owners and others before presenting recommendations to the committees by July 31, 2015. Committee recommendations On May 11, 2015, the Economic Opportunity committee voted 4-0 to not pursue a city ordinance either requiring establishments to install smoke-clearing devices or to regulate nuisances. Instead, the members said that city officials, in conjunction with the state commission, should review concerns case by case. Members acted after taking public comments and fielding a May 4, 2015, city presentation indicating that none of 54 restaurant barbecue smokers in the city already had smoke scrubbers. The other council committee also gathered. But it hadn’t made a recommendation by the day Limbaugh suggested Austin barbecue was about to vamoose. Then again, Ora Houston, the Austin City Council member who chairs the Health and Human Services panel, earlier made the motion against the city limiting barbecue smoke by ordinance that was adopted by the Economic Opportunity committee. By phone, Houston responded to our inquiry by saying she continues to prefer that the city address smoke concerns one by one. ""I would not be a supporter of a motion to have a citywide ban on barbecue smoke,"" Houston said. ""That’s what the city is known for, music and barbecue."" Our ruling Limbaugh said Austin is ""effectively"" imposing ""a ban on barbecue restaurants."" In early 2015, there was worry that a mandate that barbecue restaurants limit smoke from smokers would have that impact. However, the council didn’t adopt such a regulation and we sniffed out no factual indication it’s poised to do so. Before Limbaugh spoke, the latest panel to make a recommendation suggested city staff tackle complaints one by one--without a change in law.

"""In 1947, when I was born, there were about 450,000 lions. In the mid-70s, when my kids were born, there were about 100,000. Today, there are less than 30,000.""","As experts debate legal consequences for the Minnesota dentist who killed well-known Zimbabwean lion Cecil, conservationists and animal rights activists are using the opportunity to highlight threats to the long-term viability of lions in the wild. Animal expert and television personality Jack Hanna, who is also the director emeritus of the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, emphasized how quickly the lion population has decreased within his lifetime on ABC's This Week. ""In 1947, when I was born, there were about 450,000 lions,"" Hanna said in the Aug. 2 interview. ""In the mid-'70s, when my kids were born, there were about 100,000. Today, there are less than 30,000."" We wondered if Hanna’s claim about the lion population was true. Has the population really shrunk by more than 90 percent in 68 years, and if so, why? When it comes to counting lions, accurate numbers are almost as elusive as the animals themselves. 1940s Most scientists and researchers agree that the number of lions in the wild is in decline. The Switzerland-based International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as ""vulnerable"" on its threat scale, just one level below ""endangered."" It’s the speed of the decline that is in dispute. A spokesperson for Hanna said he was citing loose figures from the National Geographic Society’s Big Cats Initiative. The organization’s page on lions estimates that there were around 450,000 African lions in the 1940s, 100,000 in the 1980s, and 20,000 today — almost exactly mirroring what Hanna said. Other research questions some of Hanna's figures. He claimed more than 450,000 lions roamed the savannahs in the 1940s, but detailed studies of the population weren’t conducted back then. That means data for that period is virtually nonexistent. Susie Weller, a spokeswoman for Panthera, another big cats advocacy group, cited her organization’s own estimate that there were already as few as 200,000 ""over a century ago."" In other words, no one really knows how many lions there were in the 1940s. ""You might even see numbers in the millions,"" said Stuart Pimm, a professor of conservation ecology at Duke University and a contributor to the Big Cats Initiative. 1970s Hanna then claimed there were 100,000 lions in the wild during the 1970s. No empirical data exists for that time either, not that scientists haven't tried to make a best guess.  In 1996, a team of researchers employed land-use data to predict there were around 75,800 lions in 1980. The study, which was not published, is widely cited and was conducted at Cranfield University’s International Eco Technology Research Centre in the United Kingdom. Pimm said that this strategy was one of the more reliable ways to estimate the size of the population. ""What we can consider,"" he said, ""is how much lion habitat there was back then, and then approximate how many lions fit into that area. But if you’re going to put a number on it, you have to be careful to couch it in very, very approximate terms."" The geographic analysis is the closest anyone has come to a population count for that time, and it’s a rough guess at best. Jason Riggio, a doctoral candidate at the University of California, Davis and the author of a study on lion populations, said the 1980 number ""arguably should not be cited as fact"" because it doesn’t take into account expert opinions or survey data. Hanna’s claim that there were 100,000 lions left in the 1970s isn’t far off from the closest estimate for that decade, yet isn’t based on any convincing data. Today Hanna was more on target when he said there ""are less than 30,000"" lions left in the wild today. A widely used figure for the present population comes from the 2012 study led by Riggio. The paper, which combines data from two counts in the early 2000s, puts the population ""between 32,000 and 35,000."" Other organizations cited the IUCN's Red List of Threatened Species as an authoritative source for species population numbers and trends. The Red List questions Riggio’s numbers, arguing that, among other issues, his team’s use of older figures ignored downward trends that may have taken place in some regions. ""We have greater confidence in the estimate of fewer than 20,000 lions in Africa than in a number over 30,000,"" reads the group’s file on lions. Still, Hanna’s claim that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild today is within the range of these two estimates. Lions, Pimm said said, stake out in some of the most unforgiving natural habitats in the world, making them hard to locate, spot and count. ""There are roughly 30,000 lions in Africa,"" said Pimm, ""and they’re spread out over a massive area. People just don’t realize how big the continent really is."" Some researchers in the field, including Riggio, are reluctant to mention specific numbers for the changing lion population given the problematic data. But the experts agreed that Hanna's general point about a massive decline in the species is accurate. The threat lions pose to farms means that ""they are persecuted intensely in livestock areas across Africa,"" according to the IUCN, and growth in the bushmeat market has led to a decrease in the abundance of their prey. While hunters claim that trophy hunting in small numbers is a valuable way to finance conservation, the IUCN has reported an unsustainable number of kills in regions across the continent. Our ruling Hanna said, ""In 1947, when I was born, there were about 450,000 lions. In the mid-'70s, when my kids were born, there were about 100,000. Today, there are less than 30,000."" Counting lions in the wild is extremely difficult and requires a lot of estimation. Any hard numbers, therefore, should be taken with a grain of salt. Hanna’s claim reflects the consensus among researchers that lion numbers are in decline. The exact figures are up for some deabte, but his point is certainly valid",Mostly True,"August 3, 2015"
"""Obama’s Clean Power Plan ... eliminates coal-fired power plants.""","A federal plan to drive down carbon emissions wipes out coal-fired power plants, an Austin analyst wrote. In a June 2015 opinion column published in the Austin American-Statesman, Robert Henneke of the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation took issue with the Clean Power Plan released in 2014 by President Barack Obama’s administration. Henneke, director of the foundation’s Center for the American Future, wrote: ""Coal, the target of Obama’s Clean Power Plan, generates 34 percent of Texas’s electricity. The plan eliminates coal-fired power plants and requires Texas to assume reductions in excess of 27 other states combined."" It doesn’t surprise us that the nation’s second-largest state would be saddled with more reductions than a slew of other states. For this fact check, we focused on whether the Obama plan eliminates coal-fired plants — a claim the Texas office of the Environmental Defense Fund brought to our attention, calling it inaccurate. To our inquiry, a foundation spokeswoman, Caroline Espinosa, conceded by email that under the Environmental Protection Agency plan, all ""coal-fired plants are not eliminated, though,"" she said, ""a great number of them will be: enough to cause grievous harm to the Texas economy and Texas families."" Let’s summarize the plan, which is to be finalized this year, then explore its impact on coal-fired electricity plants. Clean Power Plan The Clean Power Plan is premised on the states by 2030 collectively driving down carbon emissions from power plants by 30 percent from 2005 levels — in part, the agency has said, through regional ""cap and trade"" networks, investments in renewable energy and smart grid technology — plus phase-outs of many existing coal-fueled plants. ""Power plants,"" the EPA says in a fact sheet last updated in June 2015, ""are the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States, making up roughly one-third of all domestic greenhouse gas emissions."" A 2014 fact check But PolitiFact concluded previously that the plan doesn’t outlaw coal as fuel or require coal-fired plants to close. In August 2014, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., rated False a claim by U.S. Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., that the administration plan meant coal would not be permitted as an electricity fuel, even in limited amounts. In 2014, Michael Webber, deputy director of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin, said: ""In no way does this program say coal can’t live. What it is is a death blow for outdated, old, vintage coal plants, unless they pay for"" technology upgrades. Amy Jaffe, executive director of Energy and Sustainability at the University of California, Davis, said at the time that states would influence the process as each one creates its blueprint for decreasing emissions. ""It may be in some places there is nothing you can do other than stop using coal, but there's nothing in the rules that says there can’t be coal,"" Jaffe said. EPA: Plan doesn't mandate retirement of coal-fired plants To our inquiry, a Washington-based EPA spokeswoman, Enesta Jones, said by email ""EPA’s proposal provides each state with enormous flexibility to design plans that meet their individual and unique needs, and does not mandate the retirement of any coal plants."" Nationally, though, coal is expected to recede as a fuel. The EPA’s initial estimates assumed 30 percent of the country’s energy would come from coal in 2030, down from 39 percent in 2013. According to the agency, the plan gives each state a different threshold for reducing carbon emissions it must reach based on feasibility, cost and current pollution levels, among factors. And, the agency says, it’s up to each state to decide how to comply. Federal rules against mercury emissions, which experts have described as more stringent than the pending power plan, also could factor into coal fading. Foundation cites national and Texas studies Espinosa, elaborating on Henneke’s claim, told us there are reasons to expect Texas plants to close due to the plan. By email, she pointed out a May 2015 analysis of the plan undertaken by the U.S. Energy Information Administration at the request of U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. Nationally under the plan, the report says, projected coal plant ""retirements,"" meaning closings, would total 90 gigawatts in power generation, most of that occurring by 2020. That prediction compares with an expected retirement of 40 gigawatts in coal-fueled power if the plan doesn’t take effect, the report says. New plants, the report says,would largely be fueled by natural gas and renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. Texas stands to see coal-fired generation decline by 100 billion kilowatthours by 2025 — alongside spurts in natural gas and renewable energy — with a slight coal rebound occurring by 2040, the report says. In the illustration below, the ""Base Policy"" case refers to EIA’s modeling of the Clean Power Plan and the ""AEO2015 Reference Case"" reflects its projections of energy supply, demand and prices based on federal, state and local laws in place as of October 2014 — in other words, without the EPA plan in effect:  Espinosa, in her email, said the ""remarkable extent of de facto coal-fire plant elimination in Texas"" is backed up by the the Balanced Energy for Texas Coalition--which represents consumers and coal producers, transporters and industrial users, spokesman Russ Keene told us. By email, Keene said the EPA’s own Integrated Planning Model indicates 24 of the 41-coal fired power plants in Texas would close from 2020 to 2025 under the administration plan even though none are currently scheduled to retire for other reasons. The EPA in 2013 described the planning model as a ""multi-regional, dynamic, deterministic linear programming model of the U.S. electric power sector. It provides forecasts of least cost capacity expansion, electricity dispatch, and emission control strategies while meeting energy demand and environmental, transmission, dispatch, and reliability constraints. IPM can be used to evaluate the cost and emissions impacts of proposed policies to limit emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon dioxide (CO2), mercury (Hg), and"" hydrochloric acid ""from the electric power sector."" Espinosa forwarded an email from Austin attorney Michael J. Nasi, who represents the coalition, stating the calculations behind the projection were rooted in EPA data. Separately, Terry Hadley, spokesman for the Public Utility Commission of Texas, pointed out an August 2014 filing with the commission from Nasi on behalf of the Partnership for a Better Energy Future, which the filing describes as drawing together more than 150 trade groups including the American Petroleum Institute, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Texas Association of Business and the American Farm Bureau Federation. The filing says EPA’s assumptions about plants switching from coal to natural gas to reduce carbon emissions indicate Texas would experience a decrease of 72 million megawatt hours from coal-fired plants, most of that by 2020. Other analyses We asked others including the EPA  to assess the plan’s effect on coal-fired plants. By phone and email, Ilan Levin, an Austin-based lawyer for the Environmental Integrity Project, which focuses on strict enforcement of anti-pollution laws, questioned the coalition’s conclusion that the plan would result in 24 Texas coal-fired plants shutting down. While the EPA predicts a drop in coal-fired electricity by 2030, he said, and an EPA scenario involves Texas fulfilling its CO2-reduction goals by moving from coal to natural gas power generation and improved efficiency, Levin said, the federal plan ""simply sets goals and leaves it to the states on how to get there. It's premature to say the CPP eliminates coal plants,"" he said. That said, Levin added, there ""are certainly very realistic scenarios with retirements of many Texas coal plants in the next 15 years or so. But these are driven mainly by economics. Regulatory drivers, specifically EPA rules that will involve more costs to power plants, include a long list of anti- smog and mercury rules and clean water and waste rules that have been in development for years if not decades. So, CPP is an important rule,"" he said, ""but it has not yet been implemented by the states, so all the details in terms of how it will get implemented have yet to be written."" By phone, Adele Morris, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Brookings Institution, said coal has been supplanted by other fuel sources already for a variety of reasons, some of them regulatory, others having to do with natural gas being cheaper and new plants being cheaper to build than it costs to fix up old ones. Jones, the EPA spokeswoman, called the coalition’s calculation a ""reasonable interpretation of the Integrated Planning Model (IPM) data for the proposed Clean Power Plan.  Our own review was slightly different, showing 23 additional retirements in 2025,"" she said. ""Actual compliance may differ from the illustrative approaches that EPA lays out,"" she said, again noting each state is to determine how to meet its carbon reduction goals. In Texas, Robbie Searcy, a staff spokeswoman for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages the flow of electricity to most Texans, responded to our inquiry by pointing us to a November 2014 report in which ERCOT estimated the proposed CO2 emission limits would result in the retirement of 3,300 to 8,700 megawatts of coal generation capacity in Texas. Yet Searcy also emailed us an agency summary of a December 2014 ERCOT report indicating multiple federal pollution regulations might explain plant closings. The summary said: ""Coal-fired power plants are the most affected by environmental regulations, which include the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, the Regional Haze program, the 316(b) Cooling Water Intake Structures Rule, the Electric Effluent Limitation Guidelines Rule, the Coal Combustion Residuals Disposal Rule, and the proposed Clean Power Plan released earlier this year. ""ERCOT assessed the impacts of these regulations through a generator survey and a modeling analysis. Results indicate that the Regional Haze Program and Clean Power Plan, in combination with other regulations, could result in the retirement of up to 8,700 megawatts (MW) of coal-fired generation resources in the ERCOT region. That is about half the coal-fired capacity and more than 13 percent of the overall thermal generation resources, by MW, that serve ERCOT today."" By telephone, John Hall of the Environmental Defense Fund, Texas, said he read the December 2014 ERCOT report to mean the Clean Power Plan could by itself account for 200 megawatt hours in additional coal-fueled power plant reductions in Texas--which he said amounts to one third to one half of a plant. We asked ERCOT if it expects coal-fired plant closings due to many federal pollution regulations, with the pending power plan perhaps playing a minimal role? By email, Searcy said: ""Yes, ERCOT anticipates that some coal-fired plants will retire as a result of changes to environmental regulations. It is too early to tell what… role (minimal or otherwise) CPP specifically will play."" Our ruling Henneke said ""Obama’s Clean Power Plan ... eliminates coal-fired power plants."" That’s off the mark in that the plan, yet to be finalized, doesn’t wipe out any coal-fired plants. It looks to us like decisions to close plants (or individual units) will depend on how Texas decides to address its assigned carbon-reduction goals. Meantime, pollution limits already in place might hasten shutdowns--with or without the Clean Power Plan taking effect",Mostly False,"July 24, 2015"
"""Florida has reduced its carbon emissions by 20 percent since 2005.""","Editor’s note: While researching this fact check, Rep. Bilirakis’ office on July 2, 2015, provided us with its research methodology using data through the Environmental Protection Agency’s Air Markets Program Data. Using this database, Bilirakis’ aides showed a 21.82 percent change in carbon dioxide tonnage emitted from Florida power plants between 2005 and 2012. PolitiFact was able to reproduce these results on July 2 when we followed their methodology, obtaining the same database numbers directly from the EPA website. We shared results with numerous sources who agreed the methodology was sound and the results illustrated Bilirakis’ point. We published the check with a Mostly True. Later that day, an EPA contact informed us the 2012 figure used in Bilirakis’ calculation was incorrect. The agency calculated percent change between 2005 and 2012 was 13.87 percent, not 21.82 percent.  When we queried the database again, the figure we received was the number the EPA cited. Neither Bilirakis’ aides nor the EPA could explain the discrepancy. An environmental scientist with the EPA said there had not been a revision of the figures since 2013. The 20 percent figure has been used by Bilirakis and other members of the Florida Republican caucus since at least November 2014, although this is the first time PolitiFact has checked it.  We are seeking an explanation for this discrepancy and will post findings when we have them. Republicans in Congress recently voted for legislation that would prevent the federal government from implementing new emissions regulations on power plants -- in part, some argue, because utilities are already cutting carbon levels on their own. U.S. Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Palm Harbor, said that HR 2042, known as the Ratepayer Protection Act, would protect states from costly rules that aren’t necessary. The bill would delay the Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Power Plan, which aims to reduce nationwide carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by 30 percent by 2030. The legislation also would allow states to opt out of the reduced emissions requirement. ""The EPA’s proposal on this rule has drawn widespread concern,"" Bilirakis said in a speech on June 24, 2015, before the GOP-majority House passed the legislation along party lines. ""It placed a heavier burden on Florida than other states, despite the fact that Florida has reduced its carbon emissions by 20 percent since 2005."" Congressional fights over regulations are not new, but we did a double take when Bilirakis said carbon emissions were down 20 percent over the last decade. (A reader sent us his comment and asked us to check it.) We decided to check whether the data fuels his claim. Carbon dating the claim We need to make sure one point is clear: Bilirakis was talking specifically about electricity generating power plants here. That’s important to understand, because the context wasn’t immediately clear to us -- or to some of our sources. The EPA’s new emission goals, which won’t be finalized until August, target power plants for that 30 percent reduction, starting at 2005 levels. The guidelines are part of President Barack Obama’s larger Climate Action Plan to enforce lower levels of air and water pollution. Some states and electricity providers have sued the EPA, saying the new rules are unnecessary and expensive for utilities, and therefore consumers. Enter the House’s Ratepayer Protection Act, which would keep the 30 percent reduction guidelines from going into effect for power plants until the justice system rules whether the EPA plan is legal. Obama has vowed to veto the Ratepayer Protection Act if it passes. A Bilirakis spokesman backed up the 20 percent figure by looking at EPA carbon dioxide emissions data for power plants generating more than 25 megawatts of electricity, which are covered by the EPA threshold for the guidelines. That data showed that between 2005 and 2012, the latest year with complete figures, Florida had reduced its power plant carbon dioxide emissions by 21.8 percent. That seems like a small slice of data, but even experts who were for the stronger emissions regulations told us it’s a valid use of the numbers to back up Bilirakis’ point. Power plants in Florida affected by the Clean Power Plan really have cut carbon dioxide by that much, according to the EPA. Of course, our first reaction to this claim was that all sources of carbon dioxide emissions had receded, which also turns out to be the case, although not at as high a rate. Accounting for cars, commercial and residential use, and a whole range of petroleum products, the U.S. Energy Information Administration says Florida’s overall emissions total have dropped about 15.7 percent in the same time span. The agency told us it’s not hard to imagine the number continuing to drop in subsequent years, but the data doesn’t show a 20 percent decrease. A look at the overall data from the EPA, which is recorded and calculated a little differently, puts the decrease from all sources at about 13.4 percent. What’s driving the downward trend for power plants? Environmental groups point out that there are several causes. Part of the change is because of utilities switching from coal to cleaner-burning natural gas (usage is up 67.6 percent between 2005 and 2012 in Florida) as natural gas prices have fallen. Credit also can go to increased efficiency in everything from air conditioners to washing machines to refrigerators. Some of the new product efficiencies are the result of other regulations, like the federal push to switch to compact fluorescent light bulbs. And while Florida was the second-highest electricity producing state in the country behind Texas in 2014, it still imports power to meet demand. That means if a power plant in another state burns fuel to generate electricity to sell to Florida, those carbon dioxide emissions don’t go against Florida’s total. That may be skewing the use-to-emissions ratio a bit. Finally, critics of the House legislation point out there’s one more caveat to the data Bilirakis cited: There’s no guarantee the state will maintain that drop in carbon dioxide from power plants. ""There is nothing to keep these emissions down to their current levels,"" said Susan Glickman, Florida director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, which opposes the Ratepayer Protection Act. ""If natural gas prices went back up, folks would start running coal plants more and emissions would increase -- absent any CO2 emission regulations."" Our ruling Bilirakis said, ""Florida has reduced its carbon emissions by 20 percent since 2005."" It may not be immediately clear from Bilirakis’ speech, but he’s only talking about carbon dioxide emissions from power plants that would be affected by the EPA’s Clean Power Plan. Those are the guidelines that would be put on hold by the bill passed by the House. EPA data show those Florida electricity generators have cut carbon dioxide emissions by 21.8 percent between 2005 and 2012. Overall carbon dioxide emissions from all sources didn’t decrease quite as much, dropping anywhere from 13.4 to 15.7 percent. Environmental groups also warned that the current reductions aren’t guaranteed. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information",Mostly True,"July 7, 2015"
"Replacing 100,000 old toilets with water-efficient models has saved 2.4 million gallons of water every day.","Even if Georgia were, ahem, flush with water, the number would have looked impressive. The Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District recently celebrated its rebate program that has helped homeowners replace 100,000 older model toilets with water efficient models across the 15-county metro Atlanta region. The total savings: 2.4 million gallons of water every day. ""One of the beautiful things about changing out a toilet is you get a rebate, but you also permanently save on your water bill,"" said Katherine Zitsch, the water district’s director. ""It’s not behavior based. You do what you normally do and you get those savings for as long as the toilet lasts."" And considering the water saved would fill the Georgia Aquarium 90 times a year – clearly nothing to poo poo – PolitiFact Georgia decided to dive in. Going with the flow Today’s toilet regulations date back to the 1992 Energy Policy Act, which required toilets to use 1.6 gallons of water per flush, versus the then-common 3.5-gallon models (and even older models that used as much as 8-gallons for every push of the handle). Early savings didn’t materialize because manufacturers did little more than halve the water used in a flush. Irate homeowners in news stories from the mid-Clinton years griped about having to flush multiple times to get the job done. ""Plumbers were installing and changing out toilets and handing people plungers,"" said Ellen Whitaker, executive director of the Plumbing and Mechanical Association of Georgia. ""It was as bad as it sounds. It just didn’t work. We don’t see those complaints anymore."" Technology wiped out those early problems. High-pressure gadgets, and even vacuum toilets with suction that rivals airplane lavatories, have made it possible for high-efficiency models to use just 1.28 gallons per flush. That lower number qualifies commodes for the WaterSense designation. The privately verified seal, similar to Energy Star ratings for electrical appliances, confirms toilets, faucets and showerheads are the most water-efficient on the market. Exchange of Thrones The water planning district started its toilet rebate program in 2007, well into the era of high-tech toilets but also in the midst of back-to-back droughts in Georgia. Local water utilities fund and run the program, rebating $100 on water bills when homeowners show they have replaced an older toilet with a water-efficient model. Most utilities will offer rebates for up to two toilets, though some will rebate three. The planning district has kept track of the number of toilets – as well as whether the new models are the 1.28-gallon or 1.6-gallon model.. But the district has been conservative in estimating the water saved, counting only one toilet per household, even in situations where records show more than one throne was exchanged. The district then multiplies the water saved per toilet by what its partner, the Atlanta Regional Commission, shows is the average household size in a community. Using a small jurisdiction like Bartow County, which exchanged WaterSense toilets in 49 homes, the math looks like this: Step 1: 3.5 gallon minus 1.28 gallon = 2.22 gallons per toilet. Step 2: 2.22 gallons times 49 households = 108.78 gallons Step 3:  108.78 gallons times 5 flushes = 543.9 gallons per day Step 4: 2.71 average home size times 543.9 gallons = 1,474 gallons per day Bartow also had one home that received a 1.6 gallon toilet. Using the same formula, that translates into 25 gallons a day. The water district rounded up, showing 1,500 gallons per day of savings in Bartow. Similar calculations were done across the region, to arrive at the 2.4 million gallons total, said Paul Donsky, spokesman for the ARC. Cobb and DeKalb counties, which account for 15 percent and 20 percent of the totals exchanged, run their own programs and calculate the totals slightly differently. DeKalb, for instance, assumes 10 flushes per day per toilet, not per person. That translates into more gallons but overall, fewer flushes. The Environmental Protection Agency’s WaterSense calculator uses yet another similar but not quite exact formula for its estimates. That calculator factors in 5.05 flushes per day, showing that a two-person home that switches to a WaterSense model, would save 8,200 gallons of water annually. The water planning district’s math is more conservative. Using the formula, the district arrives an estimate of annual savings of 8,103 gallons. ""They are all estimates but show our effort to reduce water use,"" said Jennifer Colaizzi, the EPA’s WaterSense spokeswoman. ""We want to encourage people to use water more efficiently."" To that end, the water district notes there has not been a slowdown in the number of people seeking and getting the toilet rebate. The program is expected to continue until most homes use the newer, water-sipping flushes. Our ruling The Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District recently touted that the region saves 2.4 million gallons of water every day, based on its toilet rebate that has replaced 100,000 commodes with more efficient models. That’s enough to fill 1,363 Olympic-size swimming pools every year. But the district’s own math backs it up. And a comparable federal calculator shows that the district is being conservative in estimating the region’s move toward water efficiency",True,"July 7, 2015"
"Says Barack Obama told the U.S. Coast Guard Academy ""that the number one threat to the military and the world today is global warming.""","As he pursues a bid for the White House in 2016, Gov. Scott Walker has made it a point to call for more action against ""radical Islamic terrorism."" He did so again while speaking June 20, 2015, in Washington, D.C., at a conference of the Faith & Freedom Coalition, a group led by conservative political strategist Ralph Reed. Toward the end of his remarks, Walker turned to national security -- or what he prefers to call ""safety."" He criticized President Barack Obama and Obama’s former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner for president. And then he made a claim about Obama, national security and global warming. ""You know, I think about how mixed up this Obama-Clinton doctrine is when it comes to foreign policy,"" Walker said. ""We've got a president who, earlier this year -- at the graduation ceremony for the Coast Guard Academy -- stood up and actually told the graduates that the number one threat to the military and the world today is global warming. ""Well, I've got a message for you, Mr. President: The number one threat to the military, the number one threat to America, the number one threat to the world, is radical Islamic terrorism and it's about time we do something about it."" Extended applause followed. But Walker made a far-reaching claim. Did Obama tell graduates from a branch of the military that global warming is the number one threat to the military and the world? What was said Walker’s claim pertains to the commencement speech the president gave May 20, 2015, at the academy, which is located in New London, Conn. The official text shows Obama devoted the bulk of his speech to climate change (he used that term, not global warming), describing it as a serious threat to America’s national security and to global security. He did not go so far as to call it the top threat to the military or the world. Here’s a key portion of what Obama said: And this brings me to the challenge I want to focus on today -- one where our Coast Guardsmen are already on the front lines, and that, perhaps more than any other, will shape your entire careers -- and that’s the urgent need to combat and adapt to climate change. As a nation, we face many challenges, including the grave threat of terrorism. And as Americans, we will always do everything in our power to protect our country. Yet even as we meet threats like terrorism, we cannot, and we must not, ignore a peril that can affect generations …. Here at the Academy, climate change -- understanding the science and the consequences -- is part of the curriculum, and rightly so, because it will affect everything that you do in your careers ….As America’s Maritime Guardian, you’ve pledged to remain always ready -- Semper Paratus -- ready for all threats.  And climate change is one of those most severe threats. And this is not just a problem for countries on the coasts, or for certain regions of the world. Climate change will impact every country on the planet. No nation is immune.  So I’m here today to say that climate change constitutes a serious threat to global security, an immediate risk to our national security. And make no mistake, it will impact how our military defends our country. And so we need to act -- and we need to act now. So, Walker suggests Obama puts climate change ahead of terrorism as a threat, but in his speech, the president notes that the U.S. needs to confront both. We also checked five news accounts of the speech -- from the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the Associated Press, TIME and Fox News. They all emphasized that Obama described climate change as a threat or serious threat to national security. Other speeches Prior to the Coast Guard speech, Obama -- in a general context -- suggested climate change is the world’s number one threat. For instance, in his State of the Union speech in January 2015, Obama said: ""No challenge  poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change."" And in April 2015, a few days before Earth Day, he said: ""Today, there's no greater threat to our planet than climate change."" So, after having identified climate change as perhaps the world’s greatest threat overall, Obama did devote a speech, given to members of the military, to the threat climate change poses to national and global security. But he didn’t go as far as Walker claims. Our rating Walker said Obama told the Coast Guard Academy ""that the number one threat to the military and the world today is global warming."" Obama on various occasions, and in a general context, has said there is no greater threat to the world than climate change. But in the speech Walker cited, the president told Coast Guard graduates that climate change was a serious threat, not the number one threat to the military or the world",Mostly False,"June 25, 2015"
"Between 1980 and 2010, water usage in Georgia dropped even as the state’s population grew.","The bad news regarding water in Georgia is legion. No major reservoir has been built since the 2007-2008 drought to insulate metro Atlanta from future water shortages. Water/sewer rates have gone up in several counties to cover everything from federally mandated upgrades to increased material costs. Then there is the so-called ""water war"" with Alabama and Florida, a multi-year battle of lawsuits over how to meet the water needs across the states. So it was a surprise to read the recent headline in the Athens Banner-Herald: ""Water use in Georgia declines, even as population grows."" The trend, the May 10, 2015 story said, was a 30 percent drop in water usage in the three decades between 1980 and 2010, the last year that federal data was available. Suffice it to say the claim whet our appetite – we save wetting our whistle for after-hours – for the numbers and what might be going on. We reached out to the U.S. Geological Survey, which has a mandate to file a water usage report for the nation every five years. In concert with that work, the agency encourages states to conduct their own reports. Georgia has compiled a report every five years since 1975, in a bid to provide information about the precious resource in a state without a single natural lake. The 1980 report shows that year, Georgia sucked 6.7 billion gallons of water from Georgia rivers and aquifers every day. In 2010, it sipped 4.7 billion gallons every day. While the reports in that overall span show some increases – including a 21 percent jump in daily use during the 1990s – water usage has plunged 30 percent when looking at the three decades. Census figures show the number of people living in Georgia over that period exploded, from 5.46 million in 1980 to 9.69 million in 2010. That’s a 77 percent increase. Given the well-known water woes in the Peach State, how is that possible? Conservation plays some role, which we will get into in a moment. But the biggest factor was the change in how thermoelectric plants across the state operated. Several of the facilities were decommissioned between 2000 and 2010 – during the worst of the drought years and the decade that saw usage plunge nearly 28 percent, said Steve Lawrence, a hydrologist with the USGS in Atlanta. Several other plants converted from coal-fired, which needs plenty of water to cool it as an energy source, to natural gas, Lawrence said. ""Thermoelectric withdrawals account typically for a third of withdrawals, so all water withdrawals decrease when such a large user drops its share,"" Lawrence said. Data is not available for 1980 for the per capita usage in Georgia. But 1985 and 2010 figures mirror the overall trend. Every Georgian used about 860 gallons of water daily in 1985 but only 470 gallons daily in 2010, Lawrence said. Those totals include a person’s share of water that a utility, say Georgia Power, uses to provide electricity. It’s unclear what the per person usage would be in 1985, if the water used by agriculture, industry and utilities are removed. But in 2010, it was an estimated 75 gallons a day per person to bathe, cook and clean, Lawrence said. ""That’s a good number, one you see with the push for water-efficient fixtures and conservation efforts like tiered pricing,"" Lawrence said. Local water providers, however, don’t always follow the statewide trend. The Cobb County Water System can provide daily usage dating back to 1986, when the then-small county used just 38.6 million gallons countywide. In 1990, when the county had about 451,000 people, average daily use was 42.5 million gallons countywide. In 2010, about 688,000 people lived in Cobb, and daily usage was 57.1 million gallons for the county. That’s a 53 percent jump in population, and a 34 percent increase in daily usage. Although the daily usage did not keep pace with the population increase, the jump itself bucks the state trend. However, water system officials point out that Cobb saw usage drop 14 percent countywide between 2006 and 2014, during the worst of the recent droughts. The 2014 daily usage, of 104 gallons per person, also is down 15 percent from the 122 gallons per person in 2005, when the county began looking at per capita usage. ""You can see very clearly the impact of our water conservation efforts, which became much more aggressive in 2008,"" county spokeswoman AikWah Leow said. Our ruling News reports claimed that Georgia has seen its water usage drop over the past three decades, in the same period that the population mushroomed. Federal reports confirm that unlikely shift, largely due to a change from coal-fired electric plants to facilities powered by natural gas. Conservation efforts also have made an impact, even if local water systems don’t show quite the same drop in usage. But the statewide trend is clear",True,"June 24, 2015"
"Says Scott Walker runs a state government that bans ""employees from talking about climate change.""","If a website from a progressive group is to be believed, state workers in Wisconsin cannot even say the words ""climate change."" So the scottaway.com website, developed by an operation called Forecast the Facts, allows readers to click a red button on the screen and get alternative words to use, like ""weather roulette"" and ""extended Popsicle season."" One tongue-in-cheek offering: ""In the U.S., FREE OUTDOOR HEATING is predicted to cause more heat waves, flooding, wildfires, sea level rise and drought."" Forecast the Facts, a project of the progressive Citizen Engagement Laboratory, says it developed the website in response to government denial of climate change. ""Governors Rick Scott (FL) and Scott Walker (WI) both run state governments that ban employees from talking about climate change,"" the group said on the site. Scott’s administration is reported to have an unofficial policy banning employees at the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other agencies, from using ""climate change"" or ""global warming"" in official communications. But we are interested here in Wisconsin and Walker, who is a top GOP presidential contender. Are state government employees in Wisconsin banned from talking about climate change? The genesis of the claim  In April, we rated True a claim by the group NextGen Climate that Tia Nelson, executive secretary of the Board of Commissioners of Public Lands, was prohibited from talking about global warming while on state time. The board manages state lands and a trust that funds school libraries and makes loans to school districts. The board employs 10 full-time staff members. On April 7, the board voted 2-1 to approve a resolution that banned its staff from ""engaging in global warming or climate change work while on BCPL time."" The resolution grew out of concerns that Nelson had spent time advocating for climate change policies as part of her role as co-chair of Gov. Jim Doyle’s now disbanded task force on global warming. The board is to vote Tuesday June 16, 2015, on a measure that would change the ban from ""engaging in global warming or climate change work"" to engaging in ""policy advocacy"" on the board’s time. About the board  But Walker is not on the board. Its members, as defined by the state constitution, are three other statewide elected officials -- Attorney General Brad Schimel and state Treasurer Matt Adamczyk, both Republicans, and Secretary of State Doug LaFollette, a Democrat. Thus, the board is not even part of the executive branch. Its 10 employees represent about .0003 percent of the state’s about 30,000 total employees. Cullen Werwie, communications director for the state Department of Administration, said no cabinet agency under Walker had such a ban. And we could not find any such evidence either. On the flip side, we did find examples of government engaging in conversation about climate change -- such as on the Department of Natural Resources’ web page, which talks about climate change and the Great Lakes, and the Department of Transportation documents related to its long-term transportation plan. A search for the terms ""climate change"" or ""global warming"" on wisconsin.gov sites yielded more than 1,000 results. A tenuous connection When we asked Forecast the Facts for back up to its claim, it sent an audio recording of the Board of Commissioners of Public Lands meeting and vote. But that board, of course, is separate from Walker. And the group’s claim was broader, referring generally to state government employees, not just those in one department. Brant Olson, the campaign director for the group, could not name any other part of state government with such as ban in place. Instead, the group cited a quote from Laurel Patrick, the governor’s spokeswoman, in a New York Times article about the board’s ban: ""Generally, Governor Walker does not think it is unreasonable to enact policies requiring board staff to focus on board-related activities."" Olson said the quote showed the climate change ban was ""clearly a decision he endorses."" While we were reporting this item, though, the group swapped in some new words. The language on the web site was changed to read: ""Governors Rick Scott (FL) and Scott Walker (WI) both support state agencies that reportedly ban employees from talking about climate change."" Even that could be outdated if the public lands board passes the measure to amend its rule. Our rating  Forecast the Facts said Walker runs a state government that bans ""employees from talking about climate change."" But the group could only name one obscure agency, outside of the governor's jurisdiction, that has such a rule in place. The rule was aimed at barring its workers from doing climate-change work while on state time. And that rule is poised to be amended. Meanwhile, we found plenty of examples where state agencies were discussing climate change",False,"June 16, 2015"
"""EPA wants to regulate … the family BBQ.""","Hands off our backyard barbecues, says former Rep. Allen West, R-Fla. West -- now the president and CEO of the National Center for Policy Analysis, a Dallas-based free-market think tank -- leapt to the defense of home-cooked meat in a signed item posted on his personal website on March 19, 2015. The article was headlined, ""Two things the EPA wants to regulate in your life,"" and referred to alleged interest by the Environmental Protection Agency in backyard barbecues and hotel shower water. Here’s an excerpt of West’s post: ""Ladies and gents, I just cannot ascertain when the absurdity of this current administration will cease. The weather is finally warming up and one of the rituals of spring and summer is the family BBQ. Well, it is for now until the Environmental Protection Agency has its way. ""As reported by Fox News, ‘the EPA is funding a $15,000 University of California-Riverside study to look at the particulate emissions you breathe when grilling over an open flame. … Why is the EPA concerned about BBQ grill emissions? Who are these people and why are they using one single dime of American taxpayer dollars for this tomfoolery?"" A reader saw West’s claim about barbecue and asked us to check it out. So we took a look at whether West was correct that the EPA wants to regulate the family BBQ. According to the Fox News article cited by West, ""the EPA is funding a $15,000 University of California-Riverside study to look at the particulate emissions you breathe when grilling over an open flame."" The study in question can be found on an EPA webpage for ""extramural research"" -- that is, research funded by EPA but carried out by external researchers. This particular study was titled, ""Technology for the Reduction of Particulate Matter Emissions for Residential Propane BBQs,"" and was to be undertaken by four researchers at the University of California-Riverside between Aug. 15, 2014, and Aug. 14, 2015. The project amount was $15,000. The objective? ""To perform research and develop preventative technology that will reduce fine particulate emissions ... from residential barbecues. This technology is intended to reduce air pollution as well as health hazards in Southern California, with potential for global application,"" according to the EPA website. So West’s claim hasn’t been made up from whole cloth. But it’s still pretty misleading. Most importantly, there’s a big difference between funding a small scientific grant and actually seeking to regulate an activity. The EPA makes clear that this grant isn’t exactly the camel’s nose under the tent. ""EPA does not regulate backyard barbecues and does not plan to in the future,"" the agency said in a statement to PolitiFact. (The Fox News article did mention this disclaimer toward the end of its story.) The difference between supporting a study and setting national policy is especially wide in this case, because the funding comes from a national student design competition -- the ""P3 Awards: A National Student Design Competition for Sustainability Focusing on People, Prosperity and the Planet."" The other study mentioned in West’s post, the one about hotel water monitoring, also stemmed from the same student design competition. This project ""aims to develop a novel, low-cost, wireless device for monitoring water use from hotel guest room showers,"" that could eventually be ""marketed to the hotel industry to reduce costs by promoting water conservation among hotel guests,"" according to the EPA’s summary. By West’s standard, would projects hosted by the White House at its science fair on March 23 also constitute a roadmap for future policymaking? Will the high school projects for a wearable breathalyzer wristband, or a system for turning algae into a biofuel -- two real projects hosted at the science fair -- automatically become guideposts for future federal rulemaking? We don’t think so. (West’s press office didn’t reply to two emails for this article.) Our ruling West said the ""EPA wants to regulate … the family BBQ."" Reasonable people can disagree over whether the research projects in question are worth spending tens of thousands of dollars of taxpayer funds. But it’s wrong to say, as West does, that their existence demonstrates that the EPA ""wants to"" regulate backyard barbecues. The EPA says it isn’t seeking to do so, and the projects in question are examples of scientific inquiry, not examples of federal rulemaking",False,"March 26, 2015"
"""More than 7,000 Americans lost their lives to climate change-fueled events last year.""","After a long career as a car dealer, lieutenant governor and ambassador, Democrat Don Beyer was elected to the U.S. of House Representatives last year with a focus on protecting the planet against climate change. Beyer, D-8th, reiterated his goal in a March 4 column for the Falls Church News-Press, calling global warming the ""existential crisis of our generation, and of course the preeminent environmental issue."" ""More than 7,000 Americans lost their lives to climate change-fueled events last year,"" he wrote. Beyer posted a similar statement on his congressional website on Feb. 4, saying climate change caused ""almost 7,000"" U.S. deaths last year. We wondered whether his claim is correct and asked for the source of Beyer’s information. Thomas Scanlon, a spokesman for Beyer, said the congressman’s office had made a mistake about the 7,000 deaths. ""That number should be globally, not just in the United States,"" he emailed. ""We made an error in editing this column for FCNP."" That said, we wondered if there was even proof that 7,000 worldwide deaths were caused by climate change last year. Scanlon referred us to a two-page report on global warming issued in January by the American Academy of Actuaries. It said ""global natural loss events"" caused 7,700 fatalities last year. The academy attributed the number to Munich RE, a global insurance company based in Germany that issues an annual report on worldwide losses from natural catastrophes. In a study released in January, the company said 7,700 deaths were caused by global disasters -- including earthquakes, storms, floods, landslides, drought, extreme temperatures and wildfires. But Munich RE doesn’t assess whether whether the natural catastrophes -- resulting in $110 billion in financial losses last year -- were caused by climate change. ""We do not have the ability to identify the direct impact of global warming on fatalities caused by natural catastrophes, other than to say any fatality caused by the earthquake peril are not due to global warming,"" emailed Peter Hoeppe, Munich RE’s head of geo risks research. ""Our data indicate an upward trend in regard to losses from weather catastrophes which, over time, have increased in both frequency and severity."" Of the 7,700 deaths, Munich RE estimated 850 were caused by earthquakes. The remaining 6,850 deaths, the company wrote, were caused by ""weather-related"" events. While there’s no precise way to measure the number of deaths caused by global warming, we should note that many experts believe it will be the root of many fatalities in coming decades. The World Health Organization predicts that an additional 250,000 people -- largely in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa -- will die annually between 2030 and 2050 because of conditions caused or exacerbated by climate change.

"""In an average grocery store, roughly 75 percent of processed foods contain genetically modified organisms, or GMOs.""","There’s a longstanding campaign to require special labels for foods made from genetically modified organisms -- plants or animals created by precisely manipulating their DNA, in ways  that don’t occur in nature. In Rhode Island, Sen. Donna Nesselbush, D-Pawtucket, has submitted legislation requiring such GMO labeling. ""Are [genetically modified foods] good for us or bad for us? The problem is that we really don’t know,"" she asserted in a commentary supporting her legislation. ""In an average grocery store, roughly 75 percent of processed foods contain genetically modified organisms, or GMOs."" She made a similar comment in a news release, saying that most processed foods contain GMOs. There’s little solid evidence that foods made from genetically modified organisms pose a greater risk to consumers than their non-modified counterparts, a fact noted by major scientific organizations such as the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Medical Association and the World Health Organization. They have been on the shelves for nearly two decades. U.S. products have been approved for market by as many as three different federal agencies. Independent safety testing has been done in Europe. We were interested in whether these products have become as commonplace as Nesselbush says. But first, we note a distinction that will be important in evaluating part of Nesselbush’s claim. She references foods that contain genetically modified organisms, which sounds scary to many people. But in reality, GMO foods typically don’t contain organisms; they’re derived from organisms that have been genetically modified. For example, if you eat a genetically modified ear of corn, you’re eating the once-living cells of a genetically modified organism.  But if you eat a brownie baked with corn syrup extracted from genetically modified corn, you’re only eating the syrup, not the organism. When we asked Nesselbush for a source, she didn’t have an immediate answer, saying that the information came from her staff. She promised to check further. In the meantime, we did our own research. It appears that the number, although widely reported, is mostly an educated guess. We contacted the Center for Food Safety, an advocacy group critical of biotechnology, which told PolitiFact National in 2007 that 60 to 70 percent of processed foods contain at least some residual genetically modified organisms. When we asked where their numbers came from, spokeswoman Abigail Seiler said they came from the Grocery Manufacturers Association, a trade group opposed to labeling for products manufactured through genetic modification. The latest grocery association statement says, ""70-80 percent of the foods we eat in the United States, both at home and away from home, contain ingredients that have been genetically modified."" When we heard back from Nesselbush, she cited the same statement as her evidence. We noted that the percentage is on target but her characterization wasn’t. The grocery association says it’s 70 to 80 percent of ALL foods we consume. She said it applies to processed foods in a grocery store. The federal Food and Drug Administration defines processed foods as ""raw agricultural commodities"" that have been ""subject to canning, cooking, freezing, dehydration or milling.""  Processed foods also include any foods that are not raw agricultural commodities under the FDA’s legal definition. It turns out that there’s little consistency in how the estimate is used. For example, Whole Foods in 2010, citing the grocery association, said ""GMOs are now present in 75 to 80 percent of conventional processed food in the U.S."" (We’re not sure if there are ""unconventional"" processed foods.) And where does the grocery association get its figure? Spokesman Brian Kennedy said it was an estimate based on  data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. We found updated numbers showing that in 2013, genetic engineering had been done on 90 percent of all cotton planted in the United States, 93 percent of all soybeans and 90 percent of all corn. Cottonseed and soybean oils are used in mayonnaise, salad dressings, cereals, breads and snack foods. Corn syrup is a widely used sweetener and corn starch is used in soups and sauces. ""Also, more than half of the sugar sold in the U.S. comes from sugar beets,"" Kennedy said. ""Sugar beets crops are 90 percent [genetically modified]."" We asked the association to detail how it settled on the 70 to 80 percentage. Kennedy repeated that it was an estimate. ""And it's important to keep in mind that these particular crops, though widely used, are not used in all processed food products. Plus you’re also overlooking all of the organic and non-GM processed food products on the market today,"" he said. John Ruff, past president of the Institute of Food Technologists, told us in an email that estimates of around 75 percent are widely quoted and are based on data from the late 1990s. ""I’m not aware of any definitive studies, perhaps because the presence of GMO derived ingredients often cannot be detected in the finished product,"" he said. ""This is because the GMO itself is not present in the product."" Nesselbush is incorrect when she says that such foods contain genetically modified organisms. Often they only contain substances created by genetically modified organisms, such as sugars, which may be identical to the sugars created by non-modified plants. Our ruling Donna Nesselbush said, ""In an average grocery store, roughly 75 percent of processed foods contain genetically modified organisms, or GMOs."" Nesselbush quoted a percentage intended to apply to all foods and not restricted to processed foods. Although the figure is widely cited by both sides in the debate, it’s not clear that this is anything more than an estimate. And finally, in the cases of many processed foods created using the sugars, oils and other products of genetically modified organisms, the organisms themselves aren’t present in the food at all",Half True,"March 22, 2015"
"Cigarette butts ""poison babies and small children because of the nicotine in them.""","A bill before the General Assembly would prohibit smoking on public beaches; the Senate Judiciary Committee took testimony on the proposal Feb. 12. There were only two speakers. One was Steven Brown, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union,’s Rhode Island chapter, who objected to the provision calling for violators being charged with a misdemeanor. The other was Karina Wood of the American Lung Association, who cited the health dangers of secondhand smoke. But she also talked about another aspect of the issue -- the environmental problems posed by beach butts (the cigarette kind, not the anatomical variety). ""Environmentally, cigarette butts are unsightly. They are the number one polluting litter on our beaches,"" she said. ""I've been involved in beach cleanups myself with my kids and you'll be amazed, or maybe you won't, at how many of those butts are littering our beaches. And they're dangerous to animals -- wildlife, birds."" ""And also they poison babies and small children because of the nicotine in them."" We've heard plenty of reports over the years that cigarette butts are the biggest source of beach pollution in Rhode Island. But we wondered whether they are really poisoning children, especially babies, whom we think of as not being able to get around on their own. It turns out that Wood was talking about the risks to children of eating discarded butts. When we contacted her to ask for some documentation, she sent us to a few pieces of research. We also sought our own information on the toxicity of nicotine. Common blends of tobacco contain roughly 15 to 25 milligrams per cigarette. The amount of nicotine in a cigarette butt could vary but just a milligram or two can be enough to produce poisoning symptoms in a child. Those symptoms include ""agitation, headache, sweating, dizziness, auditory and visual disturbances, confusion, weakness and lack of coordination,"" according to safety guide for various chemicals on the International Programme on Chemical Safety’s website. That database says the mean lethal dose for children who consume nicotine is about 10 milligrams, although we found another source that reported that the fatal dose was 40 mg to 60 mg for children. Nicotine, a neurotoxin, can kill by causing lung failure or by paralyzing the muscles that control breathing. How common is nicotine poisoning among babies or children? Wood pointed us to two studies. The first was published in the September 2009 edition of the journal Public Health by Jeffrey T. Quirk of the Erie County Department of Health in Pennsylvania. Using a national database covering about 100 U.S. hospitals, it estimated that there were 3,616 cases of cigarette poisonings and 756 cases of cigarette ingestion among children in the United States from 2002 to 2007. That's two a day, typically involving a child age 2 or younger.. Because Quirk only tallied injuries that received or required hospital treatment and didn't include children who might have been treated in homes or doctor's office, ""the actual number of children's cigarette-related injuries may be much greater,"" he concluded. Although they were mostly ""generally minor injuries, these events have the potential to induce serious complications,"" he said. The second study was done, coincidentally, in Rhode Island. For the 31-month period that began in January 1994, the state's Poison Control Center logged 146 cases in which children age 24 months or younger had ingested cigarettes or cigarette butts. Only one case occurred outside a residence -- in this instance it was a public park. In one third of the cases, the child vomited, often more than once. Two thirds of the children had no symptoms.There were no fatalities and the children generally recovered within 12 hours. Once again, that number probably underestimates the actual number of cases, the researchers said, because many parents might not have thought to call poison control. The youngest children in the study, age 6 to 12 months, accounted for 75 percent of the cases. Finally, we found a 2011 review article in Tobacco Control, a journal from the publishers of the British Medical Journal (now BMJ), which reports on 1,289 additional cases that appeared in the medical literature, 239 of which produced symptoms. ""We found that severe poisoning by cigarette butts among young children was rare but possible,"" the researcher said. ""It is clear that smokers must treat cigarette butts as toxic waste products and take more care in discarding them; children will mimic parental behaviour by putting these items into their mouths and sometime consume them in quantities sufficient to be toxic."" Finally, we asked Wood if she meant to include babies in her statement. After all, most babies -- before they become toddlers -- can only eat what people feed them. She pointed out that older babies find plenty of stuff on the floor when they're learning to crawl. ""By way of a personal anecdote, I observed my own daughter, when she was a baby of 11 or 12 months old and crawling, pick up a discarded cigarette butt on the beach and bring it to her mouth,"" Wood said. Dr. William Lewander, coauthor of the 1994 study and current director of pediatric emergency medicine at Hasbro Children's Hospital, said another child who picks up a butt might offer it to a baby and ""once they start crawling, if a cigarette butt is dropped on the floor it's possible"" for poisoning to occur. ""A toddler running around is probably most at risk,"" said Dr. Thomas Novotny, of San Diego State University, coauthor of the 2011 study. For younger children ""it's possible they would crawl around in the sand and put something in their mouth. If a 1 year old were to eat a few butts, they likely would have nicotine toxicity -- increased heart rate, irritability - and there have been some reports of seizures in the past."" In sum, the scientific literature shows that it's not a rare event for doctors and poison control centers to have to deal with young children -- who tend to put just about anything in their mouths -- who have consumed cigarettes or cigarette butts. It's seldom fatal, but it can qualify as a medical emergency, and it doesn't take much to give a child symptoms of poisoning",True,"February 23, 2015"
"""Monarch butterflies are becoming extinct"" because of increased use of crops genetically modified to withstand pesticides.","Monarch butterflies are an unexpected victim of the widespread adoption of genetically modified crops, Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said last week. A genetically modified organism has had its DNA altered in a way that does not occur in nature. One purpose is to increase the plants’ tolerance to pesticides and herbicides. Opponents of GMOs, as they are called, believe they pose health risks, though there’s no generally accepted science that says GMO products are harmful to health. Environmental impacts, however, are the focus of DeFazio’s claim. DeFazio is an advocate for policies that would require food labels to indicate if the product was made with genetically modified crops. In an appearance on MSNBC with celebrity chef Tom Colicchio on Feb. 12, DeFazio said GMO crops are harmful to nature. ""We certainly know there is going to be secondary harm to the environment,"" he said. ""In fact, monarch butterflies are becoming extinct because of this sort of dumping, (the) huge increase in pesticides’ use because of these modified organisms."" We decided to take a closer look at the effect of GMOs on the iconic orange and black butterflies. There’s little doubt that the monarch population is on the decline, but experts say that the adoption of genetically modified crops is not the sole factor. According to the Center for Biological Diversity, the monarch population has dropped 90 percent over the past 20 years. Every winter, monarch butterflies migrate from the Midwestern United States corn-belt region to the Oyamel fir forests in Mexico. This chart from Monarch Watch, a conservation group, shows the steep population change, in terms of the total area occupied by monarchs during their winter stay in Mexico:   The evidence suggests that DeFazio exaggerated when he said monarchs are ""becoming extinct."" The World Wildlife Fund classifies them as ""near threatened,"" which means they are ""likely to become endangered in the near future."" That classification is several steps away from extinct. And conservation experts told us that they are optimistic that the monarch population can be at least partially restored if the right steps are taken. ""Monarchs are not in danger of extinction,"" said Lincoln Brower, a monarch conservation scientist at Sweet Briar College. ""What is endangered is their spectacular migration and overwintering behavior."" Still, even if they are not on the verge of extinction, monarchs are certainly on the decline, at least for now. Why? Several reasons are evident, including deforestation in Mexico, recent weather patterns and reduced availability of milkweed, the butterflies’ main food source. The deforestation stems from illegal logging in Mexico. It has reduced the areas where monarchs can migrate, affecting their lifecycle. However, the Mexican government has largely curtailed the problem in the past five years, Brower said. As far as weather, a serious drought in Texas a couple years ago reduced the amount of flowers along the monarchs’ migration route. This is a problem because, in order to survive the migration, the butterflies need to pick up nectar along the way. And in 2014, an extra-long winter prevented monarchs from migrating successfully back to the United States from Mexico, Brower told the Washington Post. By far the biggest threat, though, is the lowered prevalence of milkweed, due to the increasing use of GMO crops that can withstand a heavy dose of herbicides, Brower said. Milkweed grows in and around crops such as corn and soybeans that are heavily concentrated in the U.S. Midwest. This is the monarch’s spring, summer and fall habitat, and milkweed serves as both the species’ primary food source and where its larvae grow. The problem is that, unlike the GMO crops in close proximity, the milkweed cannot withstand the herbicides. (Milkweed, like other weeds, can stifle crop yield, so farmers don’t like it.) Brower cautioned that there is not yet certain proof that the expansion of GMO crops is causing milkweed declines. But there is an ""extremely tight correlation"" among the increased use of herbicide-tolerant crops, fewer milkweed plants and the declining monarch population, he said. A 2012 study in the journal Insect Conservation and Diversity estimated that between 1990 and 2010, milkweed prevalence declined 58 percent in Midwest agricultural areas. Over the same time frame, the Monarch population declined 81 percent. By 2011, 94 percent of soybean crops were genetically engineered to withstand the widely used herbicide Roundup, and 72 percent of corn crops were herbicide-tolerant. Both genetically modified crops were introduced in the mid 1990s. Additionally, a 2007 congressional ethanol mandate increased the price of corn and soybeans, which encouraged farmers to convert grassland -- where milkweed grows -- into cropland, said Chip Taylor, director of Monarch Watch and a professor of ecology at the University of Kansas. Some argue that conservationists and the media have placed too much blame on GMOs for the loss of monarchs, saying correlation does not necessarily mean causation. Andrew Kniss, a weed expert at the University of Wyoming, wrote in a blog post that the Insect Conservation and Diversity study does not specifically examine if the adoption of GMO crops and herbicides are the reason why milkweed is dying out. There could be another cause, he said. To back up his point, Kniss pointed to a study out of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Pennsylvania State University that showed only limited effects of herbicide-tolerant plants -- and the use of herbicides -- on native plant diversity outside the border of the agricultural field.   Our ruling DeFazio said that ""monarch butterflies are becoming extinct"" because of increased use of crops genetically modified to withstand pesticides. The evidence of a connection is suggestive but not conclusive. Monarch populations have been declining alongside a shrinkage in its primary food source -- milkweed -- and the increased use of crops genetically modified to withstand pesticides and herbicides. However, causation has not been established yet, and other culprits -- deforestation and unexpected weather events -- are likely to have played a role as well. Moreover, DeFazio exaggerated when he said that the butterfly species is ""becoming extinct."" It faces significant challenges, but monarchs remain several steps away from extinction, and many conservationists think the trend can be mitigated",Half True,"February 17, 2015"
"""Oil companies can obtain an acre of public land for less than the price of a Big Mac.""","Doubts that Washington is getting as much money as it should when it leases land to oil and gas companies go back 40 years. The decades have done little to ease those concerns. In 2013, the Government Accountability Office reported that in the year before, oil and gas companies took in revenues of $66 billion and paid $10 billion to the government. Onshore leases in particular have not kept pace with the times, according to the GAO. The conservation group Center for Western Priorities took up this banner with an intriguing comparison on its website. ""Oil companies can obtain an acre of public land for less than the price of a Big Mac,"" the center wrote. The going price for a Big Mac, without the fries and the drink, is $3.99. We decided to check whether you can lease an acre of federal land for less than that. Greg Zimmerman, the policy director at the Center for Western Priorities, sent us a link to a September 2014 sales report from the Nevada office of the Bureau of Land Management. The numbers back up Zimmerman’s claim. Texas-based Appaloosa Energy paid $6,426 for the rights to drill on 3,212 acres. Buena Vista Holdings out of Colorado paid $11,392 for the rights to 5,693 acres. That comes out to $2 per acre, and even the mathematically challenged can see that is about half the price of a Big Mac. Under BLM regulations, $2 per acre is the minimum possible bid. Just to be clear, the company pays this money each year for the right to pump oil or gas from the land over a 10-year period. It doesn’t actually own the land, but it has locked down the oil and gas rights. Zimmerman acknowledges that there is another wrinkle here. There’s an additional $1.50 per acre fee for the first five years. Zimmerman described it as the cost to hold the land while the company assesses what to do with it. A BLM spokesman told PunditFact that the bidder would pay $1.50 per year for the first five years and then $2.00 a year for the next five. ""Nevertheless, even if you add the $1.50 per acre rent to the $2.00 per acre bid, it would still be less than a Big Mac,"" Zimmerman said. If the land ever starts producing oil or gas, the company starts paying royalties to the government on top of the $2 per acre leasing fee. It’s important to note that the statement simply said oil companies can obtain an acre for very little money. It doesn’t say this happens a lot. When we ran the numbers for all of 2014, we found that the average price per acre nationwide was $220. That was for parcels leased through a competitive auction. If a parcel finds no takers through competitive bidding, the government can offer it non-competitively. One time, that led to a winning bid of about $1.50 per acre. From what we could find, the lowest lease prices were all in Nevada. Brad Posey is a managing director for Appaloosa Energy, a company that successfully secured the right to a few thousand acres at a cost of $2 each. Posey said the property comes with many hurdles before any wells can be drilled. ""That land has so many restrictions on it,"" Posey said. ""There are the prairie chickens, and habitat. A very limited portion can be explored on."" Posey is correct about the land. A proposed resource management plan for the entire area puts a number of conditions on development. It protects municipal water supplies, grazing areas and trails for off-road trail riding. And animals. ""These areas contain some of the most important habitat remaining for sage-grouse and other at-risk wildlife,"" the plan said. Posey called the venture ""pure wildcat speculation."" This raises the question, if it’s such a long shot, why is the land worth even $2 an acre? Because, as another Appaloosa managing director Martin Shields explained, sometimes an unpromising bit of land surprises you. ""Many years ago, I was with a company that paid the $2 minimum and it paid off,"" Shields said. We asked Zimmerman if he knew of any land that went for $2 an acre that ever produced oil or gas. Zimmerman said he did not know of any case when it did. Our ruling The Center for Western Priorities said that oil companies can obtain an acre of public land for less than the price of a Big Mac. A Big Mac goes for $3.99. Thousands of acres of land in Nevada were leased for $2 per acre in 2014. We found one case where federal land went for about $1.50 an acre. The track record on land leased at those low rates ever producing oil or gas is quite poor and the average leasing price nationwide is $220 per acre. The claim is accurate but it downplays that companies pay a hundred times as much for land that is more likely to be productive",Mostly True,"February 16, 2015"
"""A strong majority of Americans support"" the Keystone XL pipeline.","See editor's note below During the Republican response to President Barack Obama’s 2015 State of the Union address, newly elected Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa urged bipartisan cooperation to pass a longstanding agenda item for Republicans and some Democrats -- the Keystone XL pipeline. The project has been in the works since 2008, and its current version involves a 875-mile pipeline that would run from Morgan, Mont., to Steele City, Neb. Building this link would allow 830,000 barrels of oil per day to move from the tar sands fields in Alberta, Canada, to refineries on the Gulf Coast. Opponents of the pipeline say it will increase greenhouse gas emissions and increase the risk of water pollution from spills. Supporters speak of improved energy security and jobs, and blame the Obama administration for stalling what they consider critical infrastructure supported by many business leaders and labor unions. Here’s what Ernst said during her State of the Union response on Jan. 20, 2015. ""The new Republican majority you elected started by reforming Congress to make it function again. And now, we’re working hard to pass the kind of serious job-creation ideas you deserve. One you’ve probably heard about is the Keystone jobs bill.  ""President Obama has been delaying this bipartisan infrastructure project for years, even though many members of his party, unions, and a strong majority of Americans support it. The President’s own State Department has said Keystone’s construction could support thousands of jobs and pump billions into our economy, and do it with minimal environmental impact."" We wondered whether Ernst was correct when she said that ""a strong majority of Americans support"" the pipeline. So we looked at the polling data. At the survey curation site pollingreport.com, we found five polls taken since May 2014 that asked questions that shed light on Ernst’s claim. We’ll start with the four polls that asked the question in its most basic form -- whether the respondent favors or opposes construction of the pipeline: • CBS News, Jan. 9-12, 2015. ""Do you favor or oppose building the Keystone XL pipeline that would transport oil from Canada through the United States to refineries in Texas?"" Favor: 60 percent. Oppose: 28 percent. Unsure or no answer: 12 percent. (Margin of error ± 3 percent.) • USA Today/Princeton Survey Research Associates International, Nov. 13-16, 2014. ""Should Congress and President Obama approve construction of the Keystone XL pipeline that would transport oil from Canada's oil sands region through the Midwest to refineries in Texas, or not?"" Yes: 60 percent. No: 25 percent. Unsure: 14 percent. (Margin of error ± 3.6 percent.) • Pew Research Center, Nov. 6-9, 2014. ""Do you favor or oppose building the Keystone XL pipeline that would transport oil from Canada's oil sands region through the Midwest to refineries in Texas?"" Favor: 59 percent. Oppose: 31 percent. Unsure/refused: 10 percent. (Margin of error ± 3.1 percent.) • CBS News, May 16-19, 2014. ""Do you favor or oppose building the Keystone XL pipeline that would transport oil from Canada through the United States to refineries in Texas?"" Favor: 56 percent. Oppose: 28 percent. Unsure/No answer: 17 percent. For these four polls, support for the pipeline held steady in a very narrow band, from 56 percent to 60 percent. So Ernst has a strong case to make. The only caveat stems from the fifth poll, which asked the question in a somewhat different way. An ABC News/Washington Post poll taken between Jan. 12 and Jan. 15, 2015, phrased the question this way: ""Obama has said he won't decide whether to approve a new oil pipeline from Canada to Texas until a review has determined whether it is in the national interest. The Republicans in Congress are working on a law to authorize the pipeline without Obama's approval. Which side do you support? Should the pipeline be authorized now, or should the review be completed before deciding?"" Asked the question this way, respondents were less sanguine about the approach being taken by the Republican Congress of which Ernst is now part: 34 percent said the pipeline should be authorized without Obama’s approval, while 61 percent said that the review should be completed first. (Another 2 percent said they opposed the pipeline outright, but that answer was only tallied when volunteered, not because it was given as an option.) In other words, the polls show strong and consistent public support for building the pipeline, but one poll suggests it's only after completing full reviews of its merits. Our ruling Ernst said that ""a strong majority of Americans support"" the Keystone XL pipeline. She’s right that between 56 percent and 60 percent of the public has consistently supported the project when asked outright whether it should be built. However, one poll found public concern about building it before reviews are complete -- a stance more in tune with Obama than with Republican leaders",Mostly True,"January 20, 2015"
"Says. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, once said, ""Wind is a finite resource and harnessing it would slow the winds down, which would cause the temperature to go up.""","Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, is not popular among environmentalists. A former chairman of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee, Barton is a staunch advocate for fossil fuels and expressed skepticism about the role of manmade carbon emissions in climate change. Barton’s critics like to paint him as blindly supportive of Big Oil and as anti-science. Exhibit A is a series of social media memes that mock him for suggesting that wind power can actually intensify global warming. The most extreme version we found said Barton had claimed that ""wind power would stop the Earth from rotating."" That’s clearly not true, but it’s also not clear that this claim was meant to be taken seriously. Instead, we decided to check a less outrageous -- and more common -- meme mocking Barton. A reader recently sent us a meme featuring a picture of Barton alongside the quotation, ""Wind is a finite resource and harnessing it would slow the winds down which would cause the temperature to go up."" The meme’s creator went on to comment, ""The only thing more stupid than this idiot heading the House-Senate energy conf(erence) is Michelle Bachmann's stint on the House 'Intelligence' Committee!"" (Michele Bachmann's name is misspelled.) Ultimately, we concluded that Barton’s words were significantly altered. What did Barton actually say? As it turns out, the comments from the meme we’re checking stem from a congressional hearing held almost six years ago, on Feb. 26, 2009. As part of a lengthy question-and-answer session, Barton pressed witnesses on some of the risks of shifting the nation’s energy portfolio from fossil fuels to renewable sources. In one exchange, Barton referred to a paper by Jay Apt, director of the Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Center and a professor of technology at the Tepper School of Business. In turn, Apt’s paper relied on research in an earlier paper by David W. Keith, currently a professor of applied physics and public policy at Harvard University. Barton’s off-the-cuff comments are somewhat meandering, but the general gist of what he said was to raise questions about some of the downsides of using wind to generate electricity. ""I am going to read a paragraph which is, if true, very ironic. And this is from Dr. Apt’s paper, and I quote: ‘Wind energy is a finite resource. At large scale, slowing down the wind by using its energy to turn turbines has environmental consequences. A group of researchers at Princeton University … found that wind farms may change the mixing of air near the surface, drying the soil near the site. At planetary scales, David Keith, who was then at Carnegie Mellon, and coworkers found that if wind supplied 10 percent of expected global electricity demand in 2100 … the resulting change in the earth’s atmospheric energy might cause some regions of the world to experience temperature change of approximately 1 degree Centigrade.’ …  ""Now, wind is God’s way of balancing heat. Wind is the way you shift heat from areas where it is hotter to areas where it is cooler. That is what wind is. Wouldn’t it be ironic if in the interest of global warming we mandated massive switches to energy, which is a finite resource, which slows the winds down, which causes the temperature to go up? Now, I am not saying that is going to happen, Mr. Chairman, but that is definitely something on the massive scale. I mean, it does make some sense. You stop something. You can’t transfer that heat and the heat goes up. It is just something to think about."" Reading the full text shows that the meme glossed over some important nuances, perhaps by relying on a brief summation published by Time magazine in 2010. First, even though the meme used quotation marks to frame the comment as a single, unified quote, it’s actually a stitched-together mix of several snippets from Barton’s remarks. Second, the meme ignores that when Barton said that ""wind is a finite resource,"" he was explicitly quoting Apt’s paper, rather than saying that was his personal belief. Third, the meme overlooks that when Barton supposedly said that harnessing the wind ""would slow the winds down, which would cause the temperature to go up,"" he was actually asking the witness a question rather than stating his view. And fourth, the meme ignores that Barton said in the same exchange, ""Now, I am not saying that is going to happen, Mr. Chairman."" In other words, what he was doing was posing a scenario to be discussed further. So, while Barton’s comments clearly show an openness to the ideas he addressed, the meme is off-base in suggesting that Barton was stating his own opinion. For the record, Barton’s spokesman, Sean Brown, told PolitiFact that the congressman ""believes in an all-of-the-above energy plan that includes wind and solar power but also doesn’t ignore traditional sources of energy like coal or natural gas."" Is there any credibility to the idea that wind energy might contribute to global warming? So Barton didn’t say what the meme said he did. But what about the substance of the claim -- that wind turbines can exacerbate global warming? The idea isn’t entirely out of left field, but it’s a lot more complicated than it seems on the surface. Let’s start with what was known at the time Barton made his comment six years ago. The paper ultimately referenced by Barton -- the one that Keith coauthored -- found some intriguing interactions between wind turbines and climate, namely that ""very large amounts of wind power"" can produce changes to climate ""at continental scales."" However, the authors leavened this assessment with a more optimistic note -- that such changes in climate disappear at the global level, and that, on balance, using wind power rather than fossil fuels reduces climate change, rather than exacerbating it. Keith, who didn’t respond to an inquiry from PolitiFact, and his coauthors also emphasized that what negative impacts emerged from wind-turbine use could be eased, fairly economically, by better turbine design and placement. Subsequent research has bolstered this conclusion. A 2012 study that used satellite data for west-central Texas, published in Nature Climate Change and co-authored by Liming Zhou of the State University of New York at Albany, found a ""significant warming trend"" of up to 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit per decade over wind farms, compared to nearby regions that didn’t have wind farms. However, Zhou told the Daily Telegraph that the climatic changes from wind farms paled when compared to the impact of manmade global warming. And Mark Z. Jacobson, a Stanford University professor of civil and environmental engineering, told PolitiFact that a 2012 paper he coauthored found that the impact of large arrays of wind turbines would be to cool climate -- not warm it. ""That paper is the most detailed to date,"" Jacobson said. Jacobson agreed that even installing enough wind-power capacity to power ""half the world"" would have ""small"" global impacts on climate, even though the impacts locally could be more significant. If you weigh the negatives of wind power against the negatives of fossil-fuel use, he added, ""there is only a net benefit of switching to wind."" Our ruling A social media meme says Barton once said, ""Wind is a finite resource and harnessing it would slow the winds down which would cause the temperature to go up."" Barton raised that possibility while questioning a witness during a 2009 congressional hearing, but contrary to the meme’s implication, he did not say that it was his personal belief. Rather, the meme makes fun of Barton by stitching together parts of his comments in a way that is misleading",Mostly False,"January 15, 2015"
"""January through November 2014, the year so far, were the hottest first 11 months of any year recorded.""","The  seasons may change, the weather may shift, but U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse keeps trying to get his colleagues to, as he puts it, wake up to the threat of climate change. As naysayers insist that global temperatures haven't warmed since around 1997, a claim that has validity only because the time around 1997 was an exceptionally warm year, Whitehouse took to the floor of the Senate on Dec. 17 to report that 2014 was shaping up as the warmest in modern history. ""January through November 2014, the year so far, were the hottest first 11 months of any year recorded.

The biggest reason wasn't the surface land temperatures, but it was the increase in the surface temperatures in the oceans, where the first 11 months of 2014 were the warmest on record. Many scientists say that a lot of excess heat from heat-trapping carbon dioxide is being stored in the oceans. NOAA hasn't released its December temperature numbers yet, but the Japan Meteorological Agency has. It has concluded that 2014 broke all records going back as far as 1891.

"""Keystone means unlocking the Canadian tar sands.""","The proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline between Canada and the United States is the first big political battle of 2015. The House passed a bill Friday approving construction of the oil pipeline in spite of a veto threat from President Barack Obama, who has said he is waiting on input from the State Department before making a decision on the pipeline. On Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace asked an opponent of the project, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., what Keystone XL means for energy and the environment. Coons responded, ""Keystone means unlocking the Canadian tar sands, some of the dirtiest sources of energy on the planet, and allowing those tar sands to go across our American midwest and then reach the international market."" We’ve looked into where Canada would export oil carried through Keystone XL, as well as the pipeline’s effect on the environment. But what about Coons’ claim that Keystone XL would mean ""unlocking"" western Canada’s tar sands? Does the pipeline make a difference between pumping, or not pumping, crude oil from the tar sands? The short story is the impact seems relatively small. Oil drilling companies in Western Canada have been extracting oil from its sands and transporting them to the United States for production for years, and that practice is expected to continue regardless of Keystone XL. But given the right circumstances, the absence of the Keystone XL pipeline could prevent the region from producing at full capacity. A Coons spokesman said ""he might have been better served saying ‘further unlocked’ than simply ‘unlocked.’ "" The basics The 875-mile Keystone XL pipeline, operated by TransCanada, would carry heavy crude oil mixture from Hardisty, Alberta, to Steele City, Neb. Then it would connect with an existing southern leg that opened in early 2014, delivering more than 800,000 barrels of crude oil sands to refineries on the Gulf Coast. The oil would come from the tar sands of Canada’s boreal forests. Extracting this type of dirty, thick crude oil is expensive, energy intensive and produces a significant amount of carbon emissions. Critics say that Keystone XL will elevate greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to climate change by encouraging expansion of tar sands development. However, an oft-cited U.S. State Department report about Keystone XL says the project is ""unlikely to significantly impact the rate of extraction in the oil sands."" This is because Canadian officials and oil producers vow that the oil will be extracted and reach the American marketplace by other means regardless of the proposed pipeline. Already, trains and several existing pipelines carry Western Canadian crude oil into the United States at an increasing rate -- almost 2 million barrels per day produced in 2013, with the United States importing about half of that. ""Keystone XL would only provide a more direct and somewhat less costly method of transporting Canadian heavy crude to the U.S. Gulf Coast for refining and exporting,"" said Anastasia Shcherbakova, a University of Texas Dallas clinical assistant professor in energy economics and energy finance. At most, Keystone XL would allow an increase in oil sands production of about 25 percent from today's levels, said Andrew Leach, a professor of energy policy at the University of Alberta School of Business. He said that tar sands will come out as long as there is someone willing to pay for the oil, and ""that demand doesn’t go away if there’s no pipeline from Canada."" There are several other pipelines under consideration that could carry tar sands oil to the United States. If they are built, Keystone XL on its own wouldn’t have much impact because the oil will get to the United States by other cost-effective means, said James Coleman, a law and business professor at Calgary University. On the other hand, if Keystone XL and the other pipelines aren’t constructed, oil companies could take a sizeable hit to their profit -- about $8 a barrel -- because they would have to transport the oil by rail and other means, which are more expensive, according to the State Department report. But the absence of Keystone XL on its own wouldn’t be enough to induce these added costs. Coons spokesman Ian Koski pointed to a report from the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers that shows projected growth to about 8 million barrels per day by 2030 (including U.S.-produced oil that travels on the Canadian pipelines) after adding the several pipelines under consideration, including Keystone. But if those pipelines aren’t included, growth appears stuck at around 5 million barrels per day. Without Keystone XL and the other pipelines, the tar sands could not be fully extracted because the oil would ""have nowhere to go,"" he said. Koski pointed to a couple examples of Canadian oil sands mines that were put on hold due to, in part, rising industry and transportation costs: the Joslyn Mine and the Statoil Corner project. ""Costs for labor and materials have continued to rise in recent years and are working against the economics of new projects,"" Statoil said in a statement. ""Market access issues also play a role -- including limited pipeline access, which weighs on prices for Alberta oil, squeezing margins and making it difficult for sustainable financial returns."" Regardless, experts and the State Department don’t think that Keystone XL will have a major impact one way or another on whether oil companies will continue to exploit the tar sands. However, there is a catch: Low oil prices could potentially curtail production. Cost of oil Oil prices have dropped to about $50 per barrel -- the lowest prices since 2009, the height of the recession. For Canadian oil sands to break even on production costs, oil prices need to be around $70 a barrel. Without the Keystone XL pipeline, transportation costs are high, which exacerbates the hit to revenue after low oil prices. The State Department’s report assumed oil prices staying at around $75 per barrel. It said that if oil prices fall between $65 and $75 per barrel, then the cost of transporting oil without the Keystone XL pipeline might make a difference as to whether or not Canada continues to produce tar sands oil at current rates. But under $65 per barrel -- where prices are now -- it’s more the sheer low price of oil that would negatively impact oil production rather than any pipeline in particular. ""You still need pipes, but Keystone XL or any other individual line in and of itself is not as crucial to likely growth plans,"" Leach said. Additionally, the price of oil is volatile, and many experts think it will go back up again, so a long-term impact on tar sands production due to low oil prices is not likely. ""Under State's analysis, blocking Keystone XL will only have an effect on oil sands production if all the other pipelines are blocked, and oil prices stay below $75 per barrel,"" Coleman said. ""How likely is that? I'd say it's unlikely, but no one really knows."" Our ruling Coons said building ""Keystone means unlocking the Canadian tar sands."" Oil production has been steadily growing in the Canadian tar sands without the Keystone XL pipeline. Most experts expect that trend to continue despite current low oil prices. Coons would have been on safer ground if he said Keystone XL would unlock Canada’s ability to further increase its production capacity. The pipeline would offer much lower transportation costs than current transportation methods, which would encourage greater oil production. But his literal words weren’t accurate",Mostly False,"January 11, 2015"
"Says President Barack Obama's own administration has done five environmental impact assessments of the Keystone XL pipeline, ""all of which have said it would have a minimum impact on the environment.""","Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., said one of the first acts of the new Senate will be to force President Barack Obama’s hand on the Keystone XL pipeline. The controversial project has been in the works since 2008 and its current version involves a 875-mile pipeline that would run from Morgan, Mont., to Steele City, Neb. Building this link would allow 830,000 barrels of oil per day to move from the tar sands fields in Alberta, Canada, to refineries on the Gulf Coast. Supporters speak of improved energy security and jobs. Opponents say the pipeline will increase greenhouse gas emissions and increase the risk of water pollution from spills. Speaking about the pipeline on Fox News Sunday, Thune said, ""We think the president ought to sign that into the law. His administration has done five environmental impact statements, all of which have said it would have a minimal impact on the environment, and his own State Department said it would support 42,000 jobs."" We’ve looked at the jobs claim several times (the number of permanent jobs is about 50) and in this fact-check, we’re focusing on Thune’s comments about the environmental impact statements. Thune’s office sent us a list of five studies. All were conducted by the U.S. State Department, which has jurisdiction because the project crosses the border between Canada and the United States. Whether you see them as five separate studies depends on how you look at the environmental impact statement process. Before an agency issues a Final Environmental Impact Statement, it first releases a draft version. Citizens, businesses and interest groups then submit comments that may or may not shape the final report. The State Department ultimately produced two final reports on the Keystone XL pipeline. The first one from August 2011 was preceded by two drafts. The department wrote a second report, partly because it couldn’t meet a legislative deadline to grant final approval, but more fundamentally, because the pipeline project changed. It became shorter and took a different route to avoid a particularly environmentally sensitive area. That second report, released in January 2013, also initially appeared in draft form. So we have two final environmental impact statements, and three other draft reports. Thune’s office sees that as five studies. Others take a more nuanced view. James Coleman, a law and business professor at Calgary University told PolitiFact that while there were five documents, ""they're all really draft and finalized versions of the same analysis."" A divided administration So that’s the reasoning for or against five statements. Now, what do they say? Thune contended that Obama’s administration found that the pipeline would have a minimal impact on the environment. That is a fair paraphrase of the State Department’s findings. On the key issue of greenhouse gas emissions, the State Department’s final word was that the project was ""unlikely to significantly impact the rate of extraction in the oil sands"" in Canada. In short, one way or the other, companies in Canada would continue to extract oil  -- meaning the rate of pollution was unlikely to grow simply due to the pipeline alone. But the administration has not spoken with a single voice. The Environmental Protection Agency tagged the State Department’s draft from April 2013 with the label ""Environmental objections -- insufficient information."" The EPA said, among other things, that the pipeline might have a bigger impact on greenhouse gas emissions than the State Department concluded. The focus here was on how fast oil would come out of the Canadian fields. Pulling oil from the tar sands is costly and even more so when you tack transportation costs on top. The EPA felt that the State Department had not looked carefully enough at the impact of the pipeline if oil prices fell. When oil prices fall, the lower shipping costs that come with the pipeline matter a whole lot more to keeping the enterprise viable. The State Department found that with high oil prices, the tar sands would be mined for oil, pipeline or no. Coleman told PolitiFact that finding is now in question. ""The State Department’s analysis was predicated on its assumption that West Texas Intermediate would not fall under $75 per barrel and it is now under $55. At that level, State said things could change,"" Coleman said. The State Department concluded that with prices between $65 and $75 per barrel ""higher transportation costs could have a substantial impact on oil sands production levels, possibly in excess of the capacity of the proposed Project."" But with the pipeline, transportation costs drop and production would be higher. That would affect greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA also raised objections to the State Department’s examination of potential oil spills. Our ruling Thune said that the administration had done five studies that all found that the Keystone XL pipeline would have a minimal impact on the environment. The State Department produced five documents, but in reality, all were versions of the same analysis. The State Department did conclude that the pipeline by itself would have no significant impact on the extraction of oil from Canada. However, that was the finding of one government department. The Environmental Protection Agency raised questions, based on the price of oil. The State Department’s final analysis also included the caveat that the pipeline would have a minimal impact on tar sands extraction only if oil prices remained above $75 per barrel. Since then, oil prices have fallen well below that point. Thune’s claim overstates the number of separate studies the administration has done, glosses over the differences of opinion within the administration, and fails to account for the caveat included in the State Department’s analysis",Half True,"January 4, 2015"
"Austin mayoral candidate Steve Adler opposed an injunction to stop a ""company from dumping petrochemicals directly into the Barton Springs aquifer.""","UPDATE, 5:30 p.m., Nov. 25, 2014: After hearing from Rockwell, we removed parts of our original story: testimony about whether mechanical systems could cause the project to meet anti-pollution standards – an element that didn’t speak to Rockwell’s claim – and a comment by a lawyer that workers took care of spilled gasoline, an action we didn’t confirm. We also took out our reference to a wave of litigation. While several judges considered the Lowe’s conflict in 2004, environmentalist groups filed only one lawsuit, Rockwell told us. We also made it clear Rockwell does not believe his statement was an exaggeration. These changes did not affect our rating of the claim. Vivid image: Austin mayoral candidate Steve Adler going to court to keep a judge from stopping petrochemicals from being dumped beneath Barton Springs. Austin attorney Brad Rockwell recently charged Adler, an eminent-domain lawyer, with doing just that. (Disclosure: Rockwell's daughter, Lilly Rockwell, covers city government for our parent newspaper, the Austin American-Statesman. She wasn't involved in this fact check.) ""I met Steve Adler in litigation while he was representing a company who was dismantling the SOS ordinance,"" Rockwell said at a Nov. 12, 2014, press conference held with mayoral candidate Mike Martinez next to the lengthy spring-fed swimming pool. Adler and Martinez vie in a Dec. 16 runoff. At the press conference, Brad Rockwell was referring to the Save Our Springs law approved in 1992 to limit development potentially polluting the pool. Rockwell, former deputy director of the Save Our Springs Alliance, continued: ""Adler opposed our efforts to get an injunction to stop this company from dumping petrochemicals directly into the Barton Springs aquifer."" Did Adler battle for a company to dump oil ‘neath the pool? Adler represented Lowe’s It’s public record that Adler represented Lowe’s before an Austin state district judge in 2004 and opposed a temporary injunction, shortly granted, that kept Lowe’s from continuing to build a store in Southwest Travis County. In March 2005, though, the Austin City Council moved to settle the dispute, clearing the way for the Brodie Lane store. Adler and others went before a judge in July 2004 in response to a lawsuit brought by the city of Sunset Valley and environmental groups that year intended to stop the Lowe’s project from being built on land in the heart of the Barton Springs recharge zone, described in Statesman news stories at the time as covering a 20-mile stretch of Travis and Hays counties. Rainfall in the zone percolates through soil and creek beds, a November 2003 Statesman news story said, replenishing the segment of the Edwards Aquifer that supplies not only Barton Springs but wells serving 50,000 residents. In question: Whether the plaintiffs were right that the construction was subject to the Save Our Springs ordinance limiting impervious cover to 15 percent or, as Lowe’s maintained, the company was free to put in up to 40 percent impervious cover in keeping with what Travis County permitted. In the July 1, 2004, hearing before Judge Scott Jenkins, Adler advanced reasons the project wasn’t subject to the SOS ordinance. Among his contentions: The land wasn’t in Austin’s purview, or extraterritorial jurisdiction, or if it was, the project still could proceed under looser development rules in place when plans were initially submitted to Sunset Valley. Engineer’s testimony And according to a hearing transcript, Adler didn’t say a word about whether Lowe’s should be allowed to pour petrochemicals into the earth. But during the hearing, parties seeking the injunction, including the city of Sunset Valley and Save Our Springs, called to the stand Lauren Ross, an environmental engineer, who testified about her visits to the construction site the day before. Asked if she observed conditions that would drive up average annual pollutants on the site after completion, Ross testified: ""There are clearly pollutants present on the site and discharging from the site that would not have been present prior to the beginning of the construction process."" Specifically, Ross said, she saw ""clear evidence of hydrocarbon sheens on the water in the construction rock"" around a fuel tank in violation of state requirements. Also, Ross testified, there’s ""no containment to prevent fuel spills from moving across the site."" She said that when she visited in the morning, a mesh silt fence intended to keep sediment from flowing off the site was breached at a spot where it looked to her like the land was graded to make all runoff head that way; she said the fence was restored by the time she returned in the afternoon. Most disturbing, Ross said, she saw that water running off the site wasn’t going into a culvert along Brodie Lane. Instead, she said, the flow was going into a hole in the ground onto limestone rock beneath, meaning all the project’s runoff was ""being discharged directly onto limestone that is presumably a recharge feature"" for the aquifer, she said. Asked what the flowing water looked like, Ross said the water had been filtered through the silt fence, but still had sediment and ""any of those escaping hydrocarbon sheens that we know are on the site at a more distant location."" Ross, asked her opinion of the environmental effect of the construction and on surrounding water features of the Lowe’s project, said: ""There is significant risk. And I think what I saw yesterday indicates it is much more than just a risk of contamination of downstream waters and the Edwards Aquifer from the proposed construction. It is clear that despite the engineering standards for erosion-type construction irrigation controls, these systems fail."" She also said she couldn’t recall seeing before the level of hydrocarbon sheens on a construction site that she saw on the Lowe’s site. Earlier in the hearing, Adler told the judge that stopping the $19 million project, which he called ""well underway,"" was ""going to cause greater environmental damage and greater harm than allowing the project to continue."" His legal contentions extended to mention of a 2003 state law intended to make the site subject only to Travis County’s development rules. Judge mentions ‘hydrocarbon spills’ Jenkins’ temporary injunction, issued July 2, 2004, said that if the construction continued, the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable injury due to degradation of waters in nearby Williamson Creek, Barton Springs, the Edwards Aquifer and Sunset Valley water wells. The court further finds, Jenkins wrote, ""an increased risk of water pollution, were construction allowed to continue in violation of the SOS Ordinance, because of the failure risks inherent in man-made pollution-control features."" Also, Jenkins directed Lowe’s to ""ensure storm water runoff from the property be diverted from flowing into aquifer recharge features at or adjoining the property, that Lowe’s remove fuel tanks from the property, that Lowe’s remove from the property water contaminated by hydrocarbons and perform reasonable remediation of any hydrocarbon spills at the property."" In an interview, Rockwell stressed the judge’s order as an indication his statement was accurate as well as comments by Ross to the Austin Bulldog for a May 21, 2014, news story quoting her saying that what she saw the day before the hearing was ""totally my worst nightmare about why we need to minimize construction over the aquifer. The fuel storage tank failed, secondary containment around the tank failed. ... The silt fence was down, and there was direct migration into the Edwards Aquifer,"" Ross said. Adler calls claim 'outrageous' Adler called the dumping characterization outrageous. ""To dump petrochemicals directly into the Barton Springs aquifer would be illegal in addition to being immoral,"" Adler said in an interview. ""Neither I nor Lowe’s nor co-counsel ever argued that the company should be able to dump petrochemicals into the aquifer."" The vital issue in court, Adler said, was whether a 4-3 vote by the Austin City Council in December 2003 was sufficient to let the development proceed. Save Our Springs and others successfully maintained in courts through 2004 that in keeping with the SOS ordinance, six council votes should have been required for the project to launch. Adler told us: ""Lowe’s doesn’t want to be dumping hydrocarbons down. No one in the courtroom would countenance dumping hydrocarbons down the aquifer."" Adler noted, too, that concerns about hydrocarbons going into the ground from the site weren’t part of pre-hearing briefs. Rockwell agreed, albeit pointing out no one knew of the oily sheen until the inspection visit by Ross. Rockwell, asked if his statement was an exaggeration, replied not. He also said that what he said at the press conference didn’t ""purport to summarize the whole litigation or everything about what the injunction fight was about. It’s one aspect, one very important aspect."" Other lawyers in the dispute To our inquiries, other lawyers in the dispute offered conflicting takes on this claim. Doug Young, the city attorney for Sunset Valley, which sided with the environmental groups in court, said by phone: ""Was Steve trying to vindicate the right of his client, Lowe’s, to dump petrochemicals down a recharge hole into the aquifer? No, I don’t think he was. But did he hear the uncontroverted testimony of Dr. Ross that there were petrochemicals in the surface water there?"" Young added: ""It would be unreasonable to assume Lowe’s intended to dump that gas on the ground and either not worry about where it went or intend for it to go down this recharge feature. There’s no reason to believe that. But it happened. And they opposed"" the injunction to stop the construction. Daniel Byrne, who like Adler represented Lowe’s in the hearing, said by phone: ""The notion that anyone was pumping petrochemicals into the aquifer is complete garbage."" We emailed North Carolina-based Lowe’s about this topic and didn’t hear back. Our ruling Rockwell said Adler opposed an injunction to stop a ""company from dumping petrochemicals directly into the Barton Springs aquifer."" It’s not that simple. Adler, representing Lowe’s in court, opposed a successful push by the City of Sunset Valley and environmental groups to get a temporary injunction to stop Lowe’s from continuing to build a store over the aquifer. In a hearing, an expert for the plaintiffs testified about observing a hydrocarbon sheen being part of runoff flowing from the site onto underground limestone and, significantly, the judge’s order in response said Lowe’s should address any oil spills. So, Adler sought to keep a project going that on the day before the hearing appeared to one engineer to be sending runoff with an oily sheen directly underground. However, there is vital missing context in that the legal fight wasn’t rooted in letting Lowe’s dump -- or stopping Lowe’s from dumping -- petrochemicals. The big issue was whether the site should be built out with up to 40 percent impervious cover or the 15 percent allowed under the SOS ordinance",Half True,"November 21, 2014"
"""The Kochs stand to make around $100 billion if the government approves the Keystone XL pipeline.""","Opponents of the Keystone XL pipeline are stoking fear about the project by connecting it to two of the biggest bogeymen in politics: Charles and David Koch. The claim goes that the Koch brothers stand to make $100 billion if the pipeline gets built. The figure, which would effectively double the Kochs’ net worth, has bounced around liberal news organizations and was repeated this month by progressive radio talk show and TV host Thom Hartmann on his RT show. Take it with a block of salt, a PunditFact analysis finds. The $100 billion estimate is far from a neutral analyst’s prediction, based instead on the far-out calculations of a group that wants the pipeline, and the Koch brothers, to fail. Here’s what you need to know.  Keystone and Kochs in context First, let’s put $100 billion in perspective. That’s an enormous sum, half as much as Facebook’s value, about the same as the Dominican Republic’s GDP and approximately equal to the Kochs’ combined, reported net worth. If the brothers had a sure windfall on their hands, you might think they would be actively promoting the pipeline, or at least be positioned to pounce by reserving space in it or actively drilling in the area. (Map via TransCanada.)  But the Kochs have repeatedly told reporters and Democratic lawmakers that the company has no involvement in the pipeline and is not a proposed customer. For the record, ""we are supportive of it,"" Koch Industries spokesman Rob Tappan told PunditFact. Pipeline builder TransCanada has also tried swatting down Koch connections, saying Koch Industries has ""absolutely nothing"" to do with the pipeline. Koch Industries is, however, a major player in the Canadian oil market. The Washington Post identified the company in April 2014 as the largest foreign leaseholder of acres of Canadian oil sands. An Alberta Energy spokesman told us the agency could not confirm the Post’s analysis of Koch-leased lands -- estimated to be between 1.12 million to 1.47 million acres -- because ""organizations like Koch can change and occasionally restructure."" Even so, the considerable amount of land leased by the Kochs does not automatically signal that the Kochs will get a sure $100 billion payout, or any payout. Many of the Koch land-leases, the Post reported, came before Keystone was ever proposed, the company has not reserved space in the pipeline as is typical, and the pipeline route would not run near Koch-owned refineries. How you get $100 billion The origin of the Keystone = $100 billion for the Kochs line stems from a 2013 report from the International Forum on Globalization. While that group may sound neutral, it in fact opposes ""free market"" institutions such as the World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund and North American Free Trade Agreement. The group also makes no secret of its opposition to the pipeline and Koch Industries. It produced an October 2013 report, ""The Billionaires’ Carbon Bomb: Koch brothers and Keystone XL."" Experts we consulted were struck by the report’s bias, with chapters devoted to victims of ""Koch greed"" and the Kochs’ vast web of nonprofit spending for political aims, as well as its calculation that the Keystone XL pipeline carries ""$100 billion in potential profits"" for the Kochs. Experts in energy, economics and business called the methodology behind the figure ""absurd"" and ""puzzling."" In PunditFact terminology, that would be Pants on Fire. In an email, International Forum on Globalization executive director Victor Menotti (notable for his arrest during anti-WTO protests in 1999) said his group kept the methodology ""simple to give people a credible idea of what Koch has at stake with Keystone."" The group came up with two different numbers -- experts didn’t vouch for either -- and multiplied them together to come up with Kochs' potential profits. The group assumed that the land leased by Koch would contain 15 billion barrels of ""profitable-to-produce"" Canadian tar sands oil, a guesstimate extrapolated from one documented 2006 sale of a 374,000-acre parcel with 47 billion barrels of oil mixture (more details on page 8 of the IFG report). The group assumed a $15 gross production per barrel due to Keystone XL. Multiply one by the other and you get $90 billion. Round it up by $10 billion and you get headlines. Counting the ways We consulted four experts in energy economics and the petroleum industry to review the forum’s report and offer their analysis. They pointed out 10 significant flaws. 1. Price of oil is down: When the report was released, oil prices were about $100 a barrel. They’ve since fallen to about $75 a barrel, a drop that cuts into the report’s estimated profit of $15 per barrel. Menotti acknowledges this and said his group is working on an update that accounts for the drop in the price of oil since the summer. 2. Not realistic: The amount of oil the group says the Kochs will pump through the pipeline (15-16 billion barrels) is ""enough to fill Keystone XL to capacity for about 80 years if you assume that all the oil is shipped as diluted bitumen,"" said Andrew Leach, a professor of energy policy at the University of Alberta School of Business. 3. Unlikely payoff: Leach said a better measure to understand the potential return for the Kochs is by looking at current lease sale prices. In Alberta, oil leases are running about $70 an acre. Multiply that by 2 million acres -- the high end of what the Kochs may have -- and you get $140 million. ""It’s pretty hard to believe that a pipeline would increase the value of an oil sands lease by three orders of magnitude,"" Leach said. 4. Development takes time: According to the Vancouver Observer, Koch has filed a development permit for one site, ""but the time to develop all 2 million acres would be very long,"" Leach said. The weather and infrastructure costs present more of a challenge to produce in Alberta. 5. Keystone creates more competition: The pipeline would introduce more competition into refineries that have been bottlenecked with too much oil from Bakken and Midwestern crude at Cushing, Okla., pipelines, the experts said. If the pipeline is built, more Canadian oil sands could enter the market at Gulf Coast refineries to compete with oil brought in from the Middle East and Venezuela. ""Competition doesn’t usually lead to increased prices,"" said Anastasia Shcherbakova, a University of Texas Dallas clinical assistant professor in energy economics and energy finance. 6. Does not factor in taxes: The report does not factor in taxes or royalties that need to be paid to the Canadian government, another factor that eats into the assumption of $15 profit per barrel, said Detlef Hallermann, a Texas A&M University associate clinical finance professor who earned his doctoral degree in mineral economics. 7. Lack of discount rate: The usable oil substance will not be plied from below the surface all at once. Oil-sands mining is a long-term, high-cost investment, and the report does not go into how long the estimated 6 billion barrels would take to produce. Revenues generated over time should be calculated in present value, not nominal terms, to reflect how much it costs to bring the project online and maintain it, Shcherbakova said. ""My understanding of the analysis ... is they’re counting all $100 billion as if it’s all coming to you today,"" Hallermann said. 8. The Kochs don’t own the land: The Kochs are not the owners of these acres, they own the rights to explore the parcels themselves. Leases are held for a term, not for forever, said Terry McInturff, chairman of Texas Tech University’s area of energy, economics and law. 9. Every acreage is not equal: The report assumes the geology of the leased land is uniform and will yield uniform amounts of oil. But that is not how it works in Alberta’s boreal forests. ""That would be too easy,"" Shcherbakova said. 10. Assumes no Keystone, no oil: Experts also noted that the report mistakenly assumes that other methods to transport crude oil sands would not happen if the pipeline is rejected. Our ruling The claim here is that the Koch brothers will turn a $100 billion profit if the Keystone XL pipeline is constructed, essentially doubling their net worth. As we’ve shown, the Kochs hold oil leases in Canada. We're not ruling out that they could benefit in some ways from the Keystone XL pipeline. But trying to extrapolate their oil-sands leases into a specific profit figure is sheer folly. The authors of the report that tried to do so made so many assumptions and mistakes that experts deemed their analysis ""absurd",False Pants on Fire,"November 19, 2014"
"The climate-change agreement between the United States and China ""requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years.""","During a recent visit to China, President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced a potentially landmark climate change agreement between the two countries, which are among the world’s biggest economies and biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases, and notably carbon dioxide, are produced when burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil for energy. When these gases build up in the atmosphere, most scientists say, they trap heat and raise surface temperatures, leading to changes in climate such as climbing sea levels. For years, one of the key arguments made by opponents of U.S. efforts to cut carbon emissions has been that rising emissions from other big and fast-growing economies, such as China, could swamp any reductions the United States makes. The agreement with China potentially weakens that argument. But congressional Republicans, including incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., weren’t pleased with the terms of the accord. McConnell, who represents a coal-producing state, said so on Nov. 12, 2014, while talking to reporters covering a meeting with newly elected members of his Republican conference. ""The president continues to send a signal that he has no intention of moving toward the middle,"" McConnell said. ""I was particularly distressed by the deal he’s reached with the Chinese on his current trip, which, as I read the agreement, it requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years, while these carbon emission regulations are creating havoc in my state and other states across the country."" Several readers asked us to check whether McConnell is right that the bilateral agreement ""requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years."" We turned to the announcement released by the White House on Nov. 12. Here’s the relevant portion: ""Today, the presidents of the United States and China announced their respective post-2020 actions on climate change, recognizing that these actions are part of the longer range effort to transition to low-carbon economies, mindful of the global temperature goal of 2℃. The United States intends to achieve an economy-wide target of reducing its emissions by 26%-28% below its 2005 level in 2025 and to make best efforts to reduce its emissions by 28%. China intends to achieve the peaking of CO2 emissions around 2030 and to make best efforts to peak early and intends to increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 20% by 2030. Both sides intend to continue to work to increase ambition over time."" Boiled down, the key tasks for China in this deal are: 1.) an intention to max out carbon dioxide emissions around 2030, if not sooner, and; 2.) an intention to increase to about 20 percent the proportion of non-fossil fuels, such as renewables, in China’s energy mix. When we asked for backup on his claims, McConnell’s office made two reasonable points. First, his office noted that the agreement is based on intentions, rather than on ironclad promises with enforcement mechanisms. They pointed to a column by Robert A. Manning, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, an international-affairs think tank, and a veteran of President George W. Bush’s State Department. Manning wrote that ""this is not a binding agreement and includes no benchmarks to measure progress or penalties to encourage it."" The second point McConnell’s office makes is that China may already have been planning to make these emissions cuts anyway. According to a report in Reuters, the 2030 peak date was ""in line with forecasts already made by several state-backed think-tanks, with the China Academy of Social Sciences saying in a study last week that slowing rates of urbanization would likely mean that industrial emissions would peak around 2025-2030 and start to fall by 2040."" In theory, China could ""simply shut down a lot of plants on Dec. 31, 2029,"" Jonathan R. Nash, a law professor at Emory University, told PolitiFact. ""In that case, the agreement itself doesn't obligate China to take action before 2030."" Experts said this is theoretically possible, but, in the real world, unlikely. It will take ""significant work"" for China to reach the 2030 target, said Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at UCLA. ""You can't stop your emissions immediately. Imagine if China said they would stop emissions today. That would require massive changes to implement -- no increases in driving unless cars were cleaner, no new economic growth without cutting emissions elsewhere, and so on. For China to achieve a cap in emissions by 2030, they will have to begin to find clean energy replacements very soon or seriously limit economic growth."" Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University, agreed. ""Given the inertia in the economic and energy systems of China and its recent rates of emissions growth, there is absolutely no way that could happen without … an earlier slowing of emissions growth,"" he said. ""No sensible policy would allow"" any different course, he said.   But as questionable as it is to suggest that China could do nothing until Dec. 31, 2029, and still meet the targets, there’s still a second task for China -- to increase non-fossil fuels to about 20 percent of the nation’s energy mix by 2030. Because no such infrastructure can be created overnight, China will have to start work on this part well before December 2029. Indeed, such efforts already appear to be under way, said Michael B. Gerrard, a law professor at Columbia University who has studied the issue. ""China is engaged in a massive program of building wind, solar and nuclear energy plants,"" he said. Our ruling McConnell said the climate-change agreement between the United States and China ""requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years."" McConnell’s staff has a point that the agreement isn’t binding and may simply be codifying changes China had already planned to make. Still, his claim is at best an exaggeration. While it’s theoretically possible that China could meet its emissions target simply by shutting down major plants on Dec. 31, 2029, experts say it would be much less risky to China’s economy to spend the next 16 years working toward the goal, rather than doing it overnight. But even if China did choose to make a literal overnight shift on emissions, that still doesn’t account for China’s pledge to increase non-fossil-fuel use to 20 percent of its energy mix. Building that infrastructure cannot be done overnight and will take years to carry out, experts said",Mostly False,"November 19, 2014"
"""Proximity to high-voltage power lines lowers property values by as much as 30 percent.""","For more than a decade, residents and officials from Providence and East Providence have lobbied to have the high-voltage power lines that traverse the waterfront along India Point Park buried. The latest estimate to complete the job is $33.9 million, with a 25 percent contingency fund, meaning costs could be as low as $25 million or as high as $42 million, according to figures made public by National Grid. The Friends of India Point Park, the group that has led the effort to move the power lines underground and take down the poles and towers that support them, argues that the project is worthwhile, primarily because it will remove what its members contend is a visual blight along the shores of East Providence and Providence. Burying the lines would improve the scenic beauty of the park and make the vacant land abutting it near Route 195 more marketable -- and more valuable, the group argues. ""Proximity to high-voltage power lines lowers property values by as much as 30%,"" the group says on its website, adding that multiple studies bear this out. We were curious if there really is a negative effect on property values and, if there is, whether  it’s that large. We called David Riley, the co-chairman of Friends of India Point Park, for more information. He sent us a lot of documents and references to back up the claim -- burying us in information, so to speak -- but we decided to start with a paper published in 2010 in the Journal of Real Estate Literature that is cited on his group’s website. That paper, written by a Texas A&M University professor and a colleague, reviewed more than a half-century of studies on the effects of electric transmission lines on property values. The studies included a 1992 survey of appraisers, with the majority of respondents saying that high-voltage power lines would lower the market value of a nearby property by 10 percent on average. They also included sales price analyses. Many were inconclusive or failed to quantify an effect. One 1979 model predicted a 6-percent decrease for homes between 50 and 200 feet of power lines. Another 1995 study said the effect was a drop in value of less than 5 percent and another done in 2002 in an area near Montreal put it at 9.6 percent on average. None mentioned a decrease of 30 percent. ""The studies reviewed, while having some inconsistencies in their detailed results, generally pointed to small or no effects on sales price due to the presence of electric transmission lines,"" the authors said. That didn’t sound like it supported the Providence group’s claim. So we looked at what Riley sent us.  His documents included a summary on the previously cited Montreal study that described the negative price effect as ""ranging from 5% to well in excess of 20%."" We got a copy of that 2002 study. Although it said that the average decrease was smaller, it did find a 21-percent decrease in residential sales prices for an area of homes within 50 feet of high-voltage power lines. We found separate studies in Canada carried out in relation to a power line outside Vancouver that found negative price effects of up to 27 percent for homes in close proximity, according to a report on a transmission line proposal in Alberta. Riley also sent us part of a report on property values near a power line outside of Houston. That 1993 report found that assessed values of properties abutting the easement for the power line were up to 31 percent less than those farther away. And he sent an excerpt from a 2012 report on sales in Montana that found a decrease in the values of homes in a subdivision near a transmission  line of 25 percent to 30 percent. Lastly, we found two references (here and here)  to a study in Quebec that found that values of second home lots near a high-voltage power line along recreational land were up to 34 percent lower than expected. (Because the study is in French -- and our last French class was in high school -- we were reliant on secondary sources that summarized it.) We called Providence-based real estate appraiser Tom Andolfo, who has chaired the Rhode Island chapters of the Appraisal Institute and the Real Estate Appraisers Board, to get his view.  In testimony before state regulators in 1994  on removing the power lines that cross from East Providence to Providence, he cited the 31 percent number from the Houston study. He told us, however, that he believes the actual effect is not as large. ""A realistic figure could be from 5 to 15 percent,"" he said. But Riley said he believes that because the power lines running across East Providence and Providence are on the water, the effect on property values would likely be at the upper range of figures cited in the studies. ""It … seems logical to me that power lines obstructing water views will likely depress property values more than wires in front of, say, buildings, because they'll be more conspicuous and obstructing a more pleasant, valued view that owners are paying for,"" he told us. Our ruling  The Friends of India Point Park says that proximity to high-voltage power lines lowers property values by as much as 30 percent. There are many studies on the effects of power lines on property values. Nearly all of the ones that  we found determined that there was a negative effect on values. But they differ widely in what that effect actually is. Most put it at less than 10 percent. But we found four studies in the United States and Canada that found decreases that ranged from close to 30 percent to more than 30 percent. They appeared to be isolated cases, but they did occur, according to the studies. The Friends of India Point Park does not say that such a price effect is the norm. The group only says that a decrease in value can be as much as 30 percent. Riley says that language was chosen on purpose. (There’s also some question about what the group means by ""proximity) but we won’t get into that here",Half True,"November 16, 2014"
"""There would be tens of thousands of jobs created"" if President Barack Obama approved the Keystone XL pipeline.","Republicans already have some things they’d like to do when they assume full control of Congress in January. Plans include reforming the tax code, renewing the fight against Obamacare and approving the Keystone XL pipeline, according to a Wall Street Journal editorial by House Speaker John Boehner and current Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Fox and Friends fill-in host and reporter Anna Kooiman honed in on the latter initiative during a post-Election Day discussion about the GOP leaders’ plans. ""And if you would just approve the Keystone XL pipeline, there would be tens of thousands of jobs created,"" Kooiman said Nov. 6, addressing President Barack Obama. The job-creation argument behind the controversial pipeline is one fact-checkers have reviewed many times. The bottom line: Keystone isn’t the massive jobs generator that some make it out to be. TransCanada’s project shuffling a heavy crude oil mixture from Western Canada to Steele City, Neb., has long been on hold pending a review by Obama and the State Department, which must determine if it ""serves the national interest"" because it crosses an international border. The pipeline would connect with an existing southern leg that opened in early 2014, delivering more than 800,000 barrels of oil to refineries on the Gulf Coast. As far as new jobs go, the State Department estimates the operation of the pipeline will only create 35 permanent, full-time jobs and 15 temporary contractors. The full-time workers would be ""required for annual operations, including routine inspections, maintenance and repair."" Some would work in a Nebraska field office. The lack of many full-time positions makes sense, given that the project is to build a pipeline so that tar sands can travel without the need of rail cars or ships. There are, however, temporary jobs that would be supported by building the $8 billion pipeline over one or two years. Over the course of up to two years of construction, the State Department estimates a total of 42,100 jobs ""would be supported by construction of the proposed project."" Some jobs are directly tied to the pipeline and construction. Other jobs are simply a nature of how spending $8 billion ripples out into the economy. And more than 99 percent are temporary. The State Department figures construction would require around 10,400 seasonal workers for stretches that would last either four or eight months. This works out to 3,900 ""average annual"" jobs over one year of construction, or 1,950 jobs each year if the project takes two years to finish. Construction work would be spread over four states, Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas, though most workers would be specialized and need to be brought in from outside those states, the report notes. TransCanada counts direct job creation a little differently, estimating about 9,000 overall positions for construction and manufacturing. These are not measured on an average annual basis, but on an overall basis. TransCanada argues this makes more sense because the nature of construction work is for contractors to move from one job to the next, even if it does not last for a year at a time. ""We’ve always talked about the positions because that’s what we cut the paychecks for,"" said TransCanada spokesman Shawn Howard. By either estimate, the number of direct pipeline jobs created is not in the tens of thousands. To get there, you need  to also include indirect and induced ""spin-off"" jobs. Indirect jobs are a result of goods and services purchased by construction crews. Induced jobs are jobs created by workers spending their wages in the economy. The State Department estimates that 26,100 indirect and induced jobs ""would be supported by construction of the proposed project"" during the construction phase. The jobs would be in providing the supply chain to Keystone as well as employee spending on lodging, food, entertainment, health care, etc. The State Department calls these jobs ""supported"" and not created because it includes jobs that already exist. Put it all together and you get very few permanent jobs, about 10,000 or so temporary jobs in construction and another 26,000 more temporary spin-off jobs that could be created or supported. Two additional notes: According to The Globe and Mail newspaper of Canada, the pipeline extension’s cost has risen from $5.4 billion to $8 billion. But it’s unclear if higher costs can be associated with more jobs, said Ian Goodman, president of the Goodman Group Ltd. energy and economic consulting firm. Goodman co-authored a 2011 report questioning the project’s employment potential. The increased cost factors in inflation and financing costs. ""The higher costs now being estimated by TransCanada may just be paying more dollars for a similar amount of actual work and materials to build the project."" There’s still no word on when the State Department may announce its recommendation on the project. ""We gave up guessing on that a while ago,"" Howard said, ""but the facts on the project haven’t changed."" Our ruling Kooiman said the Keystone XL pipeline would create ""tens of thousands of jobs."" A State Department review found the project could support -- not create -- 42,100 jobs. But that number needs considerable explanation and does not amount to tens of thousands of full-time jobs in the most common sense of employment. The figure represents the project’s estimated direct, indirect and induced jobs over two years of construction, and all but 50 are temporary. The State Department and TransCanada have different ways of accounting for jobs needed for the building phase, but neither estimate is in the tens of thousands. And some of the remaining indirect and induced jobs supported by subcontractors and employee spending may already exist, so that’s not exactly jobs creation as much as jobs enhancement. Kooiman’s claim is based on a seed of truth but lacks critical information",Mostly False,"November 11, 2014"
"The proposed mine in northern Wisconsin would be built without any government oversight, and will be nine miles long.","The proposed iron ore mine in far northern Wisconsin -- a project that’s attracted international attention -- has been debated and discussed in all sorts of places. But not a rock and roll song. Until now. Rock legend Bob Seger offers up criticism of the mine in a song called ""It’s Your World,"" a track on ""Ride Out,"" his first new CD in eight years. The song, which addresses climate change, includes this line: ""Let's talk about mining in Wisconsin, let's talk about breathing in Beijing."" In an Oct. 12, 2014 interview with the Detroit News, Seger expanded on his concerns about the Wisconsin project. Gogebic Taconite hopes to build the $1.5 billion mine in the Penokee Hills in Iron and Ashland counties in far northern Wisconsin. The article quoted Seger as saying: ""The governor, Scott Walker, passed a bill through the state Legislature on a weekend that there will be no environmental oversight, 'we want this mine.' Well, the mine is right by a river that runs into Lake Superior, which is some of the cleanest fresh water in the world. ""But sorry,"" Seger added, ""according to Scott Walker, there isn't going to be oversight, we're going to build this thing, and it's going to be nine miles long."" We attempted to reach Seger through his label, Capitol Records, but received no response. Size claims Since we’re checking Seger, who has his own deep catalog of hits (""Night Moves,"" ""Against the Wind,"" etc.), we decided to start with our own backlist of size-related mine claims: An Al Jazeera documentary aired in 2014 claimed the mine site is ""just up the hill"" from Lake Superior ice caves at the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. It’s more like 54 miles. We rated the claim False. State Rep. Evan Goyke, D-Milwaukee said the mine would be larger than his Assembly district, which is among the smallest in the state (True). And state Rep. Penny Bernard Schaber, D-Appleton, said the mine would be two-thirds the size of Lake Winnebago (Mostly False). Musician and writer Dan Kaufman, a Wisconsin native, raised a number of environmental concerns about the project in an opinion piece published in the New York Times. He claimed the mine ""could be extended as long as 21 miles."" We rated his claim Half True. To be sure, in terms of its size and the length of time it would operate, the Gogebic mine  would be one of the most enormous undertakings ever seen in Wisconsin. Critics say the mine poses threats to surface water and groundwater resources in the Bad River watershed, which flows into Lake Superior. The Department of Natural Resources says it will not approve a mining permit if environmental studies show the pit and related operations will cause substantial harm to the watershed, Gogebic Taconite is at least a year away from filing an application for a permit with the state. A ""pre-application"" report filed with the state says that the size of the iron ore deposit that Gogebic has the rights to could be 21 miles. But it’s not known how much of that deposit can be mined. The company says the first stage of the project would be two pits. Each would be two miles long. The first phase of mining would last an estimated 35 years. And then the company would have to seek another permit to mine the remaining deposit. So we’re not even half way to nine miles. No oversight? The second part of Seger’s claim, that the mine would be built without ""no environmental oversight,"" is also problematic. State law gives the Department of Natural Resources authority over the mine from start to finish, including exploration, sampling, mining and reclamation of the site. That oversight is already under way. The DNR’s web site devoted to the project shows 15 entries, including correspondence between the company and the state, regarding Gogebic’s plans to take bulk samples from the site. There are nine entries in another section regarding the company’s application for a stormwater permit, and more than two dozen entries under Gogebic’s application for an exploration license. ""This is a multi-year, multi-million dollar process before an application can even be submitted to the state,"" said Bob Seitz, a spokesman for Gogebic Taconite. The next major step for Gogebic is an application for a mining permit. Expected to come in 2015, that application must include the company’s plans for mining, reclamation of the site and details about how the company will handle waste rock. The most important document will be the company’s environmental impact report, which the DNR says must include the ""anticipated environmental and socioeconomic impacts of the proposed mining project and analysis of project alternatives."" The impact of the mine on the area’s air, geology, groundwater, endangered species, wetlands, aesthetics and socioeconomic issues are among the matters that must be addressed. Once the permit is received, the state has 420 days to review the application. That time frame includes a public hearing and public comment period. ""Ferrous mining projects are extremely complex and their regulation involves a host of administrative codes, including but not limited to those regarding wetlands and waterways, air pollution, waste and materials management, wildlife and fisheries, and endangered and threatened species,"" the DNR’s website says. Additionally, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will consider the mine’s impact on the Bad River watershed under the federal Clean Water Act. And the impact of the project on the nearby Bad River band of the Lake Superior Chippewa -- already on record opposed to the project -- could stir legal challenges. Our rating Seger criticizes the proposed Gogebic mine, saying it would be nine miles long and operated with no government oversight. But the size, initially, would be closer to four miles long -- two pits, each about two miles long. And the project will be subject to regulation and oversight on several fronts",False,"November 10, 2014"
"""The only candidate pocketing big money from people who want to destroy coal is Mitch McConnell.""","Not everyone agrees there’s a war on coal, as Republicans often charge, but there’s no question there’s a war over the war on coal in Kentucky’s high-profile Senate race. For months, Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell have lobbed accusations at each other, saying their opponent is too weak in supporting the state’s abundant fossil fuel. The latest salvo comes from Grimes, who has sustained accusations by McConnell that she wouldn’t fight back against the Environmental Protection Agency’s new proposal for regulating carbon emissions. In a recent ad — which begins with her ""approving"" the ad while appearing in a mine, helmet and all — she parries McConnell’s claim by launching her own coal-themed attack. ""What Mitch McConnell doesn’t want you to know is that he and his wife personally took $600,000 from anti-coal groups, including New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s anti-coal foundation,"" Grimes said. ""The only candidate pocketing big money from people who want to destroy coal is Mitch McConnell."" We’ll assess two parts of this claim. First, is McConnell ""pocketing big money from people who want to destroy coal""? And second, is he the ""only candidate"" taking money from anti-coal activists? McConnell’s money When we asked Grimes for evidence that McConnell has received $600,000 from those who oppose coal, a Grimes spokeswoman said that McConnell’s wife, former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, sits on the board of directors of Bloomberg Philanthropies, a charitable organization founded by the former New York City mayor and billionaire founder of the Bloomberg media conglomerate. In 2011, Bloomberg Philanthropies promised $50 million over four years to the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Initiative. The recipient had a decidedly anti-coal agenda, including an effort to close coal plants in many parts of the country. According to Yahoo! News, Bloomberg said, ""Ending coal power production is the right thing to do, because while it may seem to be an inexpensive energy source the impact on our environment and the impact on public health is significant."" However, Chao didn’t join the board until 2012. Bloomberg Philanthropies spokeswoman Meghan Womack told PolitiFact, ""The decision to provide funding to Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal initiative took place before Elaine Chao joined the Bloomberg Philanthropies board. Bloomberg Philanthropies’ board members do not vote on individual initiatives or program spends."" But the claim really goes off the rails when the ad says McConnell and Chao took $600,000 from anti-coal groups. Chao made far less than that — $9,400 — for serving on the board of Bloomberg Philanthropies, according to the organization’s latest annual filing in 2012. So how does the Grimes campaign get to $600,000? They also count the $684,186 in fees, stock options and other compensation that Chao made while serving on the board of directors for Wells Fargo. How can a bank be anti-coal? According to Yahoo! News, in 2013, Wells Fargo announced it would stop investing in companies that engage in mountaintop removal, a practice that involves extracting coal more or less by blowing up mountain summits. ""We recognize the significant concerns associated with this practice and we also acknowledge the significant investments made by our coal customers in their mine operations, which were entered into in good faith and in accordance with applicable regulations,"" Wells Fargo wrote in a report titled Environmental and Social Risk Management. ""As a result of our deliberate approach and the broader movement of the industry toward other mining methods, our involvement with the practice of (mountaintop removal) is limited and declining. Wells Fargo will not extend credit to individual MTR mining projects or to a coal producer that receives a majority of its production from MTR mining."" That’s not an insignificant development, but as the Washington Post Fact Checker noted in its own analysis of the ad, that only tells part of the story. For instance, Wells Fargo told the Washington Post, ""Given that we still finance coal companies, we would certainly not characterize ourselves as ‘anti-coal.’ "" Environmental groups, too, don’t agree that Wells Fargo is out to destroy coal. On the contrary, in 2012, Rainforest Action Network, Sierra Club, and BankTrack named Wells Fargo one of the top five worst banks on coal due to ""their relationship to and control over these dirty dinosaurs."" An updated report card from the groups released in 2014 gave Wells Fargo a ""B"" for its mountain-top removal investments, but the bank still scored a ""D"" for its ties to coal-fired power plants. There are certainly banks with a cozier relationship with coal and energy companies. But even though Wells Fargo says it does ""not finance coal-power plants on a stand-alone basis,"" Wells Fargo remains a bank that ""provided $1.9 billion in financing as a lead arranger or lead manager in transactions with coal-fired power companies,"" according to the environmental report. Grimes’ money How about the other side of the equation — that McConnell is the only candidate ""pocketing big money"" from anti-coal groups? As it happens, Grimes’ campaign has benefited some from groups and individuals that are critical of coal use. For starters, her campaign reported a $1,000 donation from Frances Beinecke, the president of the Natural Resource Defense Council. The NRDC was instrumental in helping the Obama administration develop the new carbon regulations on existing power plants. In October 2011, Susie Tompkins Buell, the founder of the women’s clothing line Esprit and a noted climate change activist, held a fundraiser for Grimes at her California home. Grimes’ campaign points out the McConnell has also accepted money from some donors with anti-coal ties. For example, McConnell received $2,000 in campaign contributions from David Litman, a Texas businessman who started Texas Business for Clean Air to oppose new coal plants there. Meanwhile, Grimes’ campaign has also benefited indirectly from outside groups that have helped in the ongoing ad wars in Kentucky without officially coordinating with her campaign. CREDO, a progressive organization with a campaign focused on fighting ""dirty coal,"" has spent $35,000 to air anti-McConnell ads so far, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign finance watchdog. Meanwhile, the Senate Majority PAC, a political arm of Senate Democrats, has put $4.3 million into the race. The PAC has received significant funding — about $5 million so far — from billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer. That’s not to say that Grimes’ campaign is bankrolled or heavily influenced by anti-coal organizations. Indeed, environmental groups have not jumped into the Kentucky Senate race to back Grimes with the same intensity as they have to help Democrats in states like Colorado and Michigan. But there’s enough financial support from anti-coal entities that Grimes’ claim of entirely clean hands is significantly misleading. Our ruling A Grimes ad claimed that ""the only candidate pocketing big money from people who want to destroy coal is Mitch McConnell."" The assertion is that McConnell and his wife took $600,000 from anti-coal organizations. But the overwhelming bulk of that was earned by Chao from sitting on the board of directors for Wells Fargo, a bank that, despite some steps to curb its support of mountain-top removal mining, still maintains $1.8 billion in coal investments, environmental groups say. Meanwhile, Grimes’ campaign has directly and indirectly benefited from money and ads from environmental groups and activists critical of coal",False,"October 8, 2014"
"Says Tom Steyer is a ""California billionaire who stands to profit by blocking Keystone"" and ""is spending big to help"" Bruce Braley.","It’s Republican strategist Karl Rove versus billionaire Democratic donor Tom Steyer in Iowa. Rove’s group, American Crossroads, is up with a new ad that claims the Democratic Senate candidate there, Rep. Bruce Braley, is doing the bidding for Steyer by voting against the Keystone XL oil pipeline. ""Now, a California billionaire who stands to profit by blocking Keystone is spending big to help Braley’s campaign,"" the ad says. ""Bruce Braley, he’s on the side of billionaire special interests, not Iowa workers."" Steyer is identified in the ad as the California billionaire. He has run ads helping Braley and against his opponent, Republican Joni Ernst. Rove’s group is a super PAC backed by millions of dollars in undisclosed donors, so American Crossroads warning voters about ""special interest"" dollars in the race sounds a little to us like, ""Pot, meet kettle."" But regardless, we wanted to review American Crossroads' attack against Steyer. Would he ""stand to profit"" if Keystone is killed? We reviewed the evidence. For those unfamiliar with Steyer, he’s the billionaire behind NextGen Climate Change who has promised $100 million to Democrats in the midterm elections. Some have called him the Democrats’ Koch brothers of the election cycle. How, exactly, would an environmentalist make money by blocking Keystone XL, a pipeline that would carry oil from the Alberta tar sands through Nebraska to refineries in the Gulf of Mexico? American Crossroads sent us quite a few news stories that showed Steyer wasn’t always the hardcore environmentalist he now portrays himself as. Steyer made his fortune at Farallon Capital Management, an investment group he started in the 1980s. According to a Washington Post profile and other reports, Farallon Capital heavily invested in energy throughout Steyer’s time there, including fossil fuels. Steyer left the company in the fall of 2012. ""Investments included BP and mining companies in the United States and around the world,"" the Post wrote. ""Farallon's second-largest holding in September 2012, a month before Steyer announced his departure, was a $220 million investment in the oil-and-gas giant Nexen."" Also included in Farallon’s investment portfolio was Kinder Morgan, a company that owned a pipeline connecting the Alberta tar sands to the Pacific coast. The pipeline is considered a rival to Keystone XL. So case closed, right? Not so fast. As we said, Steyer left Farallon Capital in 2012. But it wasn’t just that he left, it’s how he left. When he stepped down as a co-managing partner, Steyer directed Farallon Capital to divest his investments in the company from any of its holdings in tar sands and coal. That would have included the Kinder Morgan pipeline. Later in 2013, Steyer called for the company to divest his money from fossil fuels entirely. A spokeswoman for Steyer told the Post in June that process would conclude that month. Around the same time, Steyer took heat from Republicans for investing in an energy source he was simultaneously vilifying. In response, Steyer vowed to donate all the profits he made from Kinder Morgan pipeline to a charity. He announced in June he was donating $2 million to that cause. We don’t know if that was the full amount of the profit Steyer earned from his investment in the rival pipeline. But the ad from American Crossroads is prospective anyway, claiming that Steyer ""stands to profit"" from blocking Keystone. Steyer no longer has any way to directly earn money from the Kinder Morgan pipeline. And here’s the kicker: As of today, Farallon Capital Management no longer has any investment holdings in Kinder Morgan. Security and Exchange Commission filings for Farallon show $45 million worth of investments in Kinder Morgan through the end of 2013. But Kinder Morgan does not show up on the investment group’s portfolio for the first or second quarter of 2014. Our ruling American Crossroads said Steyer ""stands to profit by blocking Keystone"" and ""is spending big to help"" Braley’s Senate campaign. At one point, this might have been an accurate ad. Steyer’s former hedge fund, Farallon Capital Management, had significant holdings in a company that owned a pipeline considered a rival to Keystone XL, and under Steyer’s direction, his investment group had a large stake in fossil fuels. However, Steyer has since left the investment group he started, and asked his company to divest any of his holdings from fossil fuels, including tar sands. He also donated his profits from the Kinder Morgan pipeline to charity. Further, as of 2014, Farallon is no longer invested in Keystone’s competitor, according to SEC filings. As far as we can tell, Steyer would not directly profit from Keystone’s demise going forward. So the evidence from American Crossroads falls short",Mostly False,"September 19, 2014"

""Rick Scott took $200,000 from them and now he is trying to hide from it. Sound familiar?"" At that point, the screen shows a photo of Scott while the text states, ""He took the 5th 75 times."" The ad then replays video footage of Scott at a 1995 legal deposition saying, ""I don’t recall. I have no idea. What’s your question?"" PolitiFact Florida previously fact-checked a NextGen ad about that $200,000 donation, rating it Half True. And we have fact-checked a Florida Democratic Party ad about Scott taking the 5th 75 times and rated it Mostly True. Scott's pleading the 5th was related to a Medicare case, though, not oil drilling.  But this new ad tacked on another allegation that we will fact-check here: Is Scott trying to hide from this donation? The Colliers’ land and their donation Checking whether Scott is trying to ""hide from"" a donation requires a bit of backstory. In 2012, Collier Resources Co. leased about 120,000 acres of mineral rights in Collier County to Dan A. Hughes. Collier County is in Southwest Florida and includes Naples, where Scott lives. But despite residents’ protests -- including in front of Scott’s home -- the state Department of Environmental Protection in September 2013 granted Hughes a permit to inject acid deep underground to fracture the limestone. But Hughes wanted to try a procedure that hadn’t been allowed in Florida in the past. In December 2013, Hughes went ahead and used that procedure even though DEP had asked it to hold off. That led the department to fine Hughes and later file a lawsuit, which Hughes is fighting. The Collier family is not a party to the lawsuit. Nor is Scott in his personal capacity.  Why does this all matter for the ad? Because four members of the Collier family -- Barron, Miles, Parker and Thomas -- each gave $50,000 to Scott’s Let’s Get to Work Committee in January 2013. This led NextGen’s to allege in its previous ad that Scott was too cozy with oil interests: ""A dangerous new type of oil drilling near the Everglades threatened drinking water for 7 million Floridians,"" part of the ad states. ""But one Floridian is benefitting. Rick Scott drank from a fountain of campaign cash from the company that profited off pollution."" The text on the screen states: ""Rick Scott $200,000 from oil interests."" The ad didn’t mention Hughes, the oil drilling company, or the Colliers, the landowners who gave the donations, by name. Because the ad lacked those specifics, and because no pollution has been found so far, we rated it Half True. The newest NextGen ad takes this dispute a step further, saying Scott not only took the money but that ""he is trying to hide from it."" That’s a reference to an argument by the Scott campaign that it didn’t take donations from Hughes. The Miami Herald reported that Scott’s campaign spokesman, Matt Moon, strongly denied NextGen’s suggestion that Scott had taken campaign cash from Hughes, the driller. ""In fact, no political entity associated with Gov. Scott has ever received contributions from the company – in this election or 2010,"" Moon said. The Republican Party of Florida took a similar strategy in an ad, saying ""Crist’s team says Gov. Scott took contributions from this polluter. It’s total fiction. Scott didn’t take a nickel. Scott held the polluter accountable. Shut down the wells."" In fact, both sides are throwing up some fog here. The GOP is correct that Scott didn’t take a nickel from Hughes, but NextGen’s ad didn’t say he did. In the meantime, the Republicans are omitting a key point -- that Scott did take money from the Colliers, who are connected to the project referenced in the ad because they leased the land for the drilling. In the new ad, NextGen’s attack is somewhat careful in its wording. It didn’t say that Scott ""is trying to hide it."" That would have been more misleading -- these donations are a public record and Scott hasn’t done anything to restrict access to those records. Quite the contrary -- those donations have been reported by many media outlets, beginning in January 2013 when the Colliers first donated the money. But instead, NextGen said that Scott is trying to ""hide from"" the donations. There’s some truth there: When attacked over the donations, Scott’s camp released a statement that was essentially a misdirection. Scott’s statement failed to acknowledge that the landowners gave Scott’s campaign money, even though Hughes didn’t. Our ruling A NextGen ad says Rick Scott took $200,000 from the Collier family who leased their land for oil drilling ""and now he is trying to hide from it."" Actually, both sides are presenting self-interested portrayals of the truth. Scott called out NextGen for saying he had received Hughes’ money, but the group hadn’t explicitly claimed that he had, and the Scott campaign’s statement glossed over the fact that the campaign had indeed received money from Collier, a party who was integral to the drilling plan. For its part, NextGen’s charge that Scott is trying to ""hide from"" the Collier donations is exaggerated. The transaction was reported publicly per standard procedure, and there is no evidence that Scott has tried to restrict access to that information. Quite the contrary -- it has been discussed widely in media reports. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details",Half True,"August 28, 2014"
"Says Ted Cruz ""was just bribed by the Kochs to introduce a bill that would give them and their allies America’s national forests, parks, and other public lands and open them for mining, drilling, fracking and logging.""","Ted Cruz took a bribe? So said a July 11, 2014, Facebook post by Occupy Democrats depicting the second-year Republican senator from Texas as the group’s ""Sellout Politician of the Day."" Its message, brought to our attention by a reader, said: ""This is Sen. Ted Cruz, a Koch puppet. He was just bribed by the Kochs to introduce a bill that would gift or sell them and their allies America’s national forests, parks, and other public lands and open them for mining, drilling, fracking and logging.""    Democratic Party forces, including the Senate majority leader, Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, often assail the billionaire Koch brothers, Charles and David, pro-Republican Kansas industrialists who have plowed millions of dollars into influencing elections and government. PolitiFact in April 2014 rated Mostly True a statement by Reid that the Koch brothers together are the richest people in the world. The same month, PunditFact rated Half True a claim the brothers spent three times what the top 10 labor unions expended in the 2012 elections. An apples-to-apples comparison was undoable, but an independent analysis of trackable federal data found organizations tied to the Kochs spent three and a half times what unions did that year. Earlier in April, PolitiFact rated False a claim by Charles Koch, CEO of the privately held Koch Industries, Inc., that it was only in the past decade he realized the need to ""engage in the political process."" Records showed him giving tens of thousands to candidates and political committees prior to 2004 while collectively, his brother and their company’s PAC had donated $7 million to candidates and political committees. In Cruz’s Senate office, spokeswoman Catherine Frazier confirmed Cruz this summer offered a proposal, which wasn’t acted on, for the federal government to shed excess lands, but she said in an email the Occupy Democrats statement ""looks like nothing more than politically charged rhetoric with no facts to back it up."" Group lacks evidence of bribe Occupy Democrats didn’t offer evidence of Cruz getting money or another benefit to introduce his proposal. But Omar Rivero, the group’s founder and a 2014 Democratic nominee for the Florida House, said by email the Texan elected in 2012 had fielded campaign contributions from groups fueled by the Kochs, including the Club for Growth, which describes itself as the nation’s ""leading free-enterprise advocacy group."" The group has been Cruz’s top donor, giving more than $705,000 of his $18.1 million in contributions, according to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Government, which says Koch employees and the company’s PAC have contributed $25,750 to Cruz, placing Koch 26th among the senator’s most-generous givers. Rivero told us Occupy Democrats analyzed Cruz’s amendment via a July 10, 2014, web post on the pro-Democratic ThinkProgress.org website stating Cruz sought to force the government to hand prized lands in the West to home states that would be forced to burden state taxpayers with the costs of managing the lands or, more likely, sell or give away the lands for mining, drilling and logging. ""We consider it bribery,"" Rivero said, ""when a shadowy, wide-reaching corporate interest political machine like the Kochs’ bankrolls a U.S. senator’s political operation and then that same senator turns around and supports a major piece of legislation desired by those corporate interests."" What Cruz proposed We looked over the amendment, contacted a Koch spokesman and asked advocates familiar with Cruz’s proposal about this claim. In July 2014, Cruz offered his amendment as a change to legislation authored by Sen. Kay Hagan, D-N.C., the Bipartisan Sportsmen’s Act of 2014; neither survived. Cruz’s proposal said land under the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal Interior and Agriculture departments in any state shouldn’t exceed half the state’s land area. In states where those agencies do control more than half the land, Cruz proposed, the government should sell the ""excess"" land at auction or transfer it to the state. His amendment called for auctions or transfers to take place by 2020. Frazier of Cruz’s office said he offered the amendment, as he had once before, because ""he believes in principles of small government and like many conservatives, feels that federal ownership of land in the states should be limited so that the federal government does not own more than half of the land in any state."" Asked the precise origin of the idea, Frazier said: ""It came from him. He thinks the federal government should get out of the landlord business."" Koch role? Like many companies, Koch Industries lobbies in Washington, according to summaries of federal records by the CRP, and it spent $5.4 million lobbying there from January through June 2014, just before Cruz offered his proposal. Koch lobbyists reported interests in nearly 50 topics including appropriations to the Interior and Agriculture departments, according to the center, though the company did not report any lobbying related to Hagan’s proposal. To our inquiry, Rob Tappan, a Washington, D.C.-based spokesman for Koch Public Sector, part of Koch Industries, said by email the Kochs had no position on Cruz’s amendment nor, he said, did it lobby the issue or contact Cruz’s office to discuss it. Shrinking federal lands not a new idea Experts familiar with Cruz’s idea said they were unaware of information confirming the Occupy Democrats’ claim. Each also said it's not a novel idea to reduce the amount of federally owned land. Broadly, Jessica Goad of the Colorado-based Center for Western Priorities, which says it ""promotes responsible policies and practices, and ensures accountability at all levels to protect land, water, and communities in the American West,"" told us it’s not novel for legislators or members of Congress to advocate the sale or transfer of federal lands. Cruz’s amendment, she said by phone, ""is in line with the anti-government, anti-establishment tone of that side of the (Republican) party."" Curiously, Goad said, Cruz’s proposal would limit the transfer or sale of ""excess"" lands to the states of Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Nevada and Utah, the only states where more than half the land is federally controlled. She emailed us a Nov. 14, 2008, Heritage Foundation map of the U.S., drawing on federal data, showing the share of federally owned acreage by state. (Uncle Sam owns 2 percent of the land in Texas, the map indicates.) And how did the federal government end up with so much land in some of the states? Goad pointed out a center illustration showing that as a condition of joining the U.S., western states agreed to give up any stake in otherwise unclaimed lands in their respective boundaries.  Goad said the concept of transferring or selling off federal lands has been promoted by right-leaning groups. By email, she pointed out a ""model resolution"" for state legislatures from the American Legislative Exchange Council, urging Congress to convey title of federal public lands to the states. An ALEC summary says: ""Currently, huge swaths (over 50 percent) of the land in our nation’s western states are controlled by the federal government making it impossible for states to tax this land to fund education, grow state economies and generate high-paying jobs. Further, federal control prevents the states from accessing the abundant natural resources contained on these lands."" By phone, Alan Rowsome of the Wilderness Society, which describes itself as the ""leading American conservation organization working to protect our nation’s shared wildlands,"" said he had no information on the Kochs touching off Cruz’s proposal, which Rowsome described as a ""blunt instrument"" to shift lands to states or auctions instead of leaving decisions to designated federal agencies. He said, too, there’s no certainty under Cruz’s amendment that the trims of federal lands would lead to drilling for oil and gas or to forests being cleared. ""It is not a mandate of the legislation,"" he said. Brian Mullis, a Cato Institute spokesman, put us in touch with Shawn Regan of the Montana-based Property & Environmental Research Center, a think tank which says its scholars have ""documented how government regulation and bureaucracy often led to environmental degradation."" By email, Regan said Cruz’s proposal reflected ""a sentiment in many western states that local control of public lands is more desirable than management by distant federal bureaucracies."" Of note, Regan said, three states affected by Cruz’s proposal -- Idaho, Nevada and Oregon -- are not oil-and-gas rich. He noted too that under the proposal, the secretaries of Agriculture and Interior would be responsible for identifying acreage to be auctioned off or transferred. Regan speculated: ""These almost certainly would not be national parks, wilderness areas, or other ‘pristine’ federal lands, but would likely be lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management or Forest Service—many of which are already managed for logging, grazing, and energy development."" Our ruling Occupy Democrats said Cruz ""was just bribed by the Kochs to introduce a bill that would give them and their allies America’s national forests, parks, and other public lands and open them for mining, drilling, fracking and logging."" If excess federal lands were put up for auction, as possible under Cruz’s amendment, anyone including the Kochs could perhaps purchase the lands and then, as the owners, possibly chop down trees, drill for oil and the like. All this said, this group failed to provide (nor did we find) evidence of a bribe or any Koch-linked inducement causing Cruz to present his proposal nor did we find confirmation his proposal came about so pristine federal lands could be exploited.

"Says Rick Scott took $200,000 in campaign contributions from a company that ""profited off pollution.""","California billionaire Tom Steyer’s NextGen Climate group unleashed an ad that accuses Gov. Rick Scott of being cozy with a polluter. ""A dangerous new type of oil drilling near the Everglades threatened drinking water for 7 million Floridians,"" states part of the ad. ""But one Floridian is benefitting. Rick Scott drank from a fountain of campaign cash from the company that profited off pollution."" The text on the screen states: ""Rick Scott $200,000 from oil interests."" Scott’s side refuted the ad and the Republican Party of Florida counter-punched with its own TV ad: ""Crist’s team says Gov. Scott took contributions from this polluter. It’s total fiction. Scott didn’t take a nickel. Scott held the polluter accountable. Shut down their wells...."" Did Scott, who is facing re-election, take campaign cash from a ""company that profited off pollution"" and receive $200,000 from oil interests? We decided to drill down to sort out the facts. Controversial drilling project led state to sue When we dug into the ad, we found a very complicated backstory. The ad’s makers told us the contributions refer to Collier Resources Co., but the story really begins with a separate company: Dan A. Hughes Co. In June 2012, Collier leased about 120,000 acres of mineral rights to Hughes. A few months later Hughes received a state permit to construct its first exploratory well. The public outcry began when Hughes sought additional permits the next year. Residents received a letter in April 2013 from a Hughes subcontractor asking for information needed to draw up an evacuation plan in case of an explosion. Despite residents’ protests, in September 2013, DEP granted Hughes a permit to inject acid deep underground to fracture the limestone. The process is similar to hydraulic fracking, which has been the subject of heated debate across the country, although the industry term for it is ""acid stimulation."" Hughes also wanted to try something never before allowed in Florida. After injecting the acid, Hughes workers injected a mix of sand and chemical gel under pressure to prop open the new fractures and let the oil flow out. That's known as using a ""proppant,"" and it was not covered by the DEP permit, the Tampa Bay Times reported. In December 2013, Hughes told DEP that it intended to start that operation in a few days. The DEP sought a short delay to review the plan, but then Hughes did it anyway. That led DEP to fine Hughes $25,000 in April and order Hughes to hire an expert to monitor groundwater for contamination. After months of wrangling, the state said Hughes failed to meet the terms of the consent order, yanked the company’s permits and filed a lawsuit. Collier and Hughes agreed to terminate the lease, and Hughes announced that it was pulling out of Florida. DEP conducted groundwater sampling and found no contamination, but environmentalists say more extensive testing is needed. ""Hughes is not a ‘polluter’ nor has it turned a profit on the well, which the company unilaterally shut-in due to the controversy,"" Hughes spokesman David Blackmon said. There was, however, an entity that ""profited"" -- though we can’t say they ""profited from pollution"": the Collier Resources Co. that leased the land to Hughes. Blackmon told PolitiFact Florida that Hughes will not be reimbursed for the terminated lease.  Campaign contributions The ad doesn’t identify the campaign donors or company when it states that ""Rick Scott drank from a fountain of campaign cash from the company that profited off pollution."" For those following the controversy, it would be easy to wrongly assume the ad referred to donations from Hughes. But Hughes ""has not contributed to the Crist or Scott campaigns and does not intend to,"" Blackmon said. Instead, NextGen is referring to four members of the Collier family -- Barron, Miles, Parker and Thomas -- who each gave $50,000 to Scott’s Let’s Get to Work Committee in January 2013. PolitiFact Florida verified those donations on the state elections website. We asked a Collier representative why the individuals donated to Scott, but the answer didn’t shed much light. ""Certain individual owners have personally supported the Governor in the past, but those decisions are made individually and without any input from Collier Resources Company,"" said Priscylla M. Oliva, executive assistant to Barron Collier Companies, in an email to PolitiFact Florida. The Collier family has donated to multiple state and federal candidates and causes -- mostly Republicans and conservative groups. In terms of state donations, the donation to Scott stands out. We found one state donation that was larger than the ones to Scott’s committee: Parker Collier gave $525,000 to the Republican Party of Florida in 2010. In 2010, Parker and Miles Collier were ranked seventh in the country among top individuals funding outside spending groups, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Our ruling NextGen’s ad states that ""Rick Scott drank from a fountain of campaign cash from the company that profited off pollution"" and received $200,000 from oil interests. Scott’s campaign received $50,000 from four different members of the Collier family. The Collier Resources Co. leased mineral rights on its land to Hughes for drilling, so it’s fair to refer to those donations as being from ""oil interests.""  However, there are two key elements of the claim that are misleading. The ad doesn’t name the company or campaign donor, so it’s possible for viewers who are knowledgeable about the controversy to mistakenly assume that the donations were by Hughes.  The other problematic part is that there isn’t proof that pollution occurred. The state’s preliminary tests indicated there was no contamination. Though environmentalists say additional testing is needed, we rate claims based on information available at the time",Half True,"August 15, 2014"
"""What (the Obama administration is) going to come out with in the next several months is you're not even going to be able to burn coal very limitedly in the existing plants.""","Is President Barack Obama poised to stop any more coal from burning in the United States? That’s the message from U.S. Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican running for Senate in West Virginia against Democrat Natalie Tennant. In a campaign ad released July 29, Capito, surrounded by blue-collar workers, warns against Obama’s coal regulations. ""The president's come out with rules that say 'no new coal-fired power plants,’"" Capito says. ""But what he's going to come out with in the next several months is you're not even going to be able to burn coal very limitedly in the existing plants."" We already fact-checked the claim that new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency say ""no new coal-fired power plants."" We said it was Mostly False. But what about existing power plants? We decided to take a look. What the EPA is doing In June 2014, the EPA, at Obama’s direction, proposed a plan to reduce carbon emissions by 30 percent compared to 2005 base levels over the next 25 years. The plan is now in a 12-month review period before it is finalized. The proposal does not say that existing coal plants must be shut down or can’t burn coal. So in a literal sense, Capito’s claim falls flat. In fact, baked into the EPA’s own estimates is an assumption that 30 percent of the country’s energy will still come from coal in 2030. (In 2013, about 39 percent of U.S. power came from coal.) Here’s what the EPA is actually doing. Under the new rules, the EPA has given each state its own goal for reducing carbon emissions over the next 25 years. While the goal is a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gases nationally, every state has a different threshold it must reach based on feasibility, cost and current pollution levels, among other factors. How are these goals achieved? The EPA basically says it's up to states to decide. There are a variety of options, including proposals for states to create regional cap and trade networks, invest in renewable energy and build smart grid technology. And, yes, they could phase out existing coal plants. But experts we spoke with said that’s far from a certainty or the only option. First, the steps toward reaching these goals will be gradual. So to insinuate that within several months the EPA is going to stop plants from burning coal is just fear mongering. Second, it’s important to keep in mind that many of the coal plants already in existence are quite old — most have been in operation at least 30 years — and were on track to be retired in the next decade anyway. Perhaps these new rules accelerate that process, but it was coming. Another reason many coal plants were set to close is because of existing federal rules against mercury emissions. These rules are much more stringent than the new carbon rules, experts told us. But plants that weren’t scheduled for retirement that can meet the mercury standards have other options to stay open. For example, they can retrofit their facilities with technology that will result in cleaner emissions, such as scrubbers that remove some of the carbon. ""In no way does this program say coal can’t live,"" said Michael Webber, the deputy director of the Energy Institute at The University of Texas at Austin. ""What it is is a death blow for outdated, old, vintage coal plants, unless they pay for"" technology upgrades. So how does the EPA proposal say ""you're not even going to be able to burn coal very limitedly in the existing plants""? We asked Capito’s campaign for evidence. Spokeswoman Amy Graham told us that, ""Not a single West Virginia coal plant meets the average standard set for our state in the EPA rule. That doesn't mean that every plant has to close, but because 95 percent of our state's electricity production comes from coal, in order to reduce the state's emissions rate to the required average, coal capacity will have to close."" But that’s not remotely close to what Capito said. In fact, the idea that the EPA proposal ""doesn’t mean that every plant has to close"" seems to entirely contradict Capito’s claim in the ad. What’s next for coal? Some energy companies might find technological upgrades too costly, and will seek alternatives such as natural gas, which is much cheaper right now. But for other facilities, particularly larger ones, the initial upfront costs may be offset by savings from creating more efficient, modern plants, said Dallas Burtraw, associate director of the Resources for the Future Center for Climate and Electricity Policy, an energy think tank funded by government, nonprofits and energy companies. ""We’re going to see a shakeout of older and smaller coal plants, the least efficient ones anyway,"" Burtraw said. ""The ones that remain will have a high level of environmental controls and will run relatively efficiently with a high utilization rate."" States, too, will influence this process when they create their blueprint for decreasing emissions, said Amy Jaffe, executive director of Energy and Sustainability at the University of California, Davis. ""It may be in some places there is nothing you can do other than stop using coal, but there's nothing in the rules that says there can’t be coal,"" Jaffe said. ""States have been given targets based on their existing profiles and will come back to the EPA with state plans for how to meet a target of reduction. Some states that are using coal will continue to burn coal and find other ways to cut emissions."" We asked Paul Meier, an associate scientist and director of the University of Wisconsin Energy Institute, to review what impact the rules might have on West Virginia in particular. Coal plants in West Virginia on average emit 2,056 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour. The EPA’s proposed guidelines would require West Virginia coal plants to average 1,748 pounds of carbon per megawatt hour by 2020 and 1,620 pounds per megawatt hour by 2030, a 21 percent decrease that Meier said ""requires only a slight reduction in coal reliance."" ""This can be accomplished by improving the efficiency of the coal plants, or by displacing some of the coal generation with natural gas, nuclear, renewable electricity,"" Meier said. ""States may propose their own plan to accomplish this, and may also receive credit for increasing conservation and efficiency efforts."" Our ruling Capito said ""What (Obama is) going to come out with in the next several months is you're not even going to be able to burn coal very limitedly in the existing plants."" The proposal Capito is referring to is an EPA plan to cut carbon emissions in existing power plants. Those rules do not prohibit current facilities from burning coal, and even Capito’s spokeswoman said the rule ""doesn't mean that every plant has to close."" Some facilities will close down within the next decade, but many of those plants were scheduled to be retired anyway due to age and other factors. States and power companies have options to continue to utilize coal for energy, and experts said they expect coal to remain part of the national portfolio for years to come",False,"August 7, 2014"
"""Global warming is a hoax.""","Can a 10-year-old debunk ""the greatest deception in the history of mankind?"" One congressional hopeful thinks so. A five-minute video outlining the beliefs of Republican Lenar Whitney, a Louisiana state representative running for U.S. Congress, has been making its rounds on the Internet over the past couple of days. And what does Whitney think is a big-government ""scam"" and ""conspiracy""? The video’s title says it all: ""Global Warming is a Hoax."" ""Energy security is real, global warming is not. It is merely a strategy designed to give more power to the executive branch while increasing taxes in a progressive stream to regulate every aspect of American life,"" Whitney says in the video. The video might not have received much national attention if it weren’t for a Washington Post column in which David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report called Whitney ""the most frightening candidate (he’s) met in seven years interviewing congressional hopefuls."" On top of frightening, Wasserman -- who has interviewed more than 300 congressional candidates -- called her ""fact-averse."" Whitney is running for an open seat that represents parts of Baton Rouge. The race is attracting a large field of candidates that includes former Gov. Edwin Edwards, a Democrat who served time in prison for racketeering. We’ve lost track of how many times we’ve fact-checked climate change denial claims and found them to be False or Pants on Fire. (See here, here and here.) But given that it's still being talked about, we thought it was worth reviewing the evidence again. Whitney's video offers some specific pieces of evidence that are in need of debunking. The hoax We talked to several climate scientists who said Whitney’s claim was ""laughable,"" ""deeply misguided,"" ""uninformed,"" ""disgusting"" and ""absurd."" So is there a mass conspiracy to pull the wool over the world’s eyes? It seems highly unlikely, considering the numerous studies that show overwhelming consensus among respected scientists that anthropogenic (human-caused) global warming is indisputable. Among climate researchers most actively publishing scientific articles, at least 97 percent believe in anthropogenic climate change, found one 2009 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a scientific journal. The study examined published scientific articles and surveyed experts. The study says that the few ""contrarian"" scientists are a vocal, but small, minority. They also found that those scientists denying human-caused climate change tend to have less expertise in the subject than those who believe in it. Another survey out of the University of Illinois found that 82 percent of earth scientists (out of more than 3,000 respondents) believe that global temperature shifts are human-caused. Among climate-specific earth scientists who responded, 97.4 percent said they believe in human-caused climate change.    ""It seems that the debate on the authenticity of global warming and the role played by human activity is largely nonexistent among those who understand the nuances and scientific basis of long-term climate processes,"" the 2009 report said. ""The challenge, rather, appears to be how to effectively communicate this fact to policymakers and a public that continues to mistakenly perceive debate among scientists."" Beyond the surveys, there is a consensus among the world’s premier science organizations -- such as the National Academy of Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the Royal Society in London -- that human-caused global warming is real, said Riley Dunlap, an environmental sociology professor at Oklahoma State University. (Not to mention NASA, the American Meteorological Society, the American Geophysical Union and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.) Dunlap co-authored a study published in 2013 that found a strong link between conservative think tanks and climate change denial books. It also found that a growing number of these books are produced by people with no scientific training, and nearly 90 percent of the books examined did not go through a peer review process, meaning they were not subjected to scientific scrutiny. And the consensus is not limited to just scientists. For example, Admiral James Locklear, commander of American naval forces in the Pacific, told the Boston Globe last year that climate change and rising sea levels are the biggest long-term security threat to the region. Recently, former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who served under former President George W. Bush, wrote a column in the New York Times urging lawmakers to take action to combat climate change for the sake of the economy. David Jenkins, president of Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship, said there is no legitimate reason to doubt the severity of climate change. ""A true conservative would be prudent, listen to the experts and take action to address the threat,"" Jenkins said. His group aims to foster understanding about the environment among conservatives. Some conservatives say global warming is real, but has not risen to levels portrayed by the Obama administration, such as Chip Knappenberger, assistant director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank. Knappenberger said that what’s questionable is how much of a threat human carbon emissions pose and whether proposed regulations will do more harm than good. Climate change skeptics’ talking points have evolved since the 1990s as the scientific evidence has grown, said Dunlap, who has been studying public opinion of climate change for 20 years. They first said the Earth wasn’t warming. Then they said the Earth was warming, but it’s not caused by human activity. Now, many agree with the science, but it’s not that big of a problem. ""But in (Whitney’s) case, she’s reverting to some of the most primitive statements,"" Dunlap said. Her evidence? Whitney’s supporting evidence used in her video is too simplistic to be meaningful. Here's a few of her pieces of evidence: ""Any 10 year old can invalidate their thesis with one of the simplest scientific devices known to man: a thermometer. The Earth has done nothing but get colder each year since the film’s release,"" she said, referring to former Vice President Al Gore’s 2006 global warming film An Inconvenient Truth. Global temperatures have ""paused"" growth over the past several years, but to say this is proof global warming isn’t real is cherry-picking. As we’ve previously reported, 12 of the past 15 years have been the hottest years on record, according to NASA. Tied for the top are 2005 and 2010. (Even the source that Whitney’s campaign pointed us to agreed that there has been no significant cooling trend in the past few years.) The past 150 years have been characterized by overall warming, with intermittent periods of slowed warming or cooling, said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado-Boulder. ""Fifty years from now, and assuming that carbon dioxide concentrations continue to rise at current rates, the period of slower warming from the late 1990s (of 2006) to present will appear as just another blip on the overall pattern of warming,"" he said. Whitney also said, ""Last summer, Antarctica reached the coldest temperature in recorded history."" Ted Scambos of the National Snow and Ice Data Center did record the lowest temperature ever recorded on Earth: about -135 degrees fahrenheit. But Serreze said this is one temperature taken at one location, so it has little to do with global warming. It was more a triumph of technology, because a satellite recorded the temperature remotely. And Whitney said there is ""record sheet ice and a 60 percent rise of ice in the Arctic sea."" Serreze said Whitney likely meant ""sea ice,"" which has had record highs in recent years. Sheet ice refers to land-based features, like Greenland and Antarctica. But this also doesn’t disprove global warming. Ozone depletion and greenhouse gases intensifies westerly winds and drives them south, which causes sea ice in Antarctica to extend further north, wrote Guy Williams, a sea ice specialist at the University of Tasmania, in a Washington Post column last month. In the Arctic Sea, the minimum ice extent (measured in September) for 2013 was about 50 percent higher than it was in 2012, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. But 2012’s minimum ice extent was a record low in the satellite era, so even though Arctic ice extent grew, it was still far below average in 2013. Overall, sea ice (measured every September via satellite) has decreased about 13 percent each decade since 1981, Serreze said. Whitney mentions a trove of leaked emails from the University of East Anglia in England between some of the world’s leading climate scientists. She says the 2009 emails prove global warming is a ""scam,"" and scientists faked and hid data. But several investigations concluded that there was no data manipulation, despite climate change skeptics’ claims. A bonus: Jenkins pointed out that the thermometer Whitney holds up in her video is not a weather thermometer, but a medical thermometer. Our ruling Whitney said, ""global warming is a hoax."" There is an overwhelming consensus among respected scientists that human-caused global warming is real, and Whitney’s supporting evidence falls flat",False Pants on Fire,"August 1, 2014"
"""We would create thousands of jobs in Colorado, if the Keystone Pipeline were to be built.""","President Barack Obama’s indefinite delay of the Keystone XL pipeline has become a wedge issue between Democrats and Republicans as the midterm election season heats up. In the Colorado Senate race, Democratic Sen. Mark Udall recently voted against Congress fast-tracking the pipeline, but said the administration’s review process should continue. His likely Republican opponent, U.S. Rep. Cory Gardner, has called for swift approval, insisting it would be an economic boon to the state. In an interview on Univision Radio, a primarily Spanish-language station, Gardner accused Senate Democrats of holding up the pipeline to placate environmentalists in an election year. ""The Keystone Pipeline would create good-paying jobs,"" Gardner said. ""Not only where the pipeline is being built, good-paying construction jobs, but manufacturing and service opportunities in Colorado along with the Keystone Pipeline. We would create thousands of jobs in Colorado, if the Keystone Pipeline were to be built."" The planned route for the pipeline, which would connect diluted oil sands from Western Canada to Nebraska and then Gulf Coast refineries, doesn’t go through Colorado. So we wondered if it was possible that ""thousands"" of jobs would be created by the pipeline there. We asked Gardner’s staff for the source of his claim. Spokesman Alex Siciliano pointed us to the written testimony of Gary Mar, who represented Alberta, Canada, in Washington and spoke at a House Energy and Commerce committee hearing in February 2011. Mar cites a 2009 study from the Canadian Energy Research Institute that estimates over 15 years ""the development of Alberta’s oil sands will boost U.S. GDP by an average of $31 billion per year, creating over 624,000 jobs in the U.S."" We couldn’t find the original study, but a chart Mar appended to his testimony says Colorado would see 11,200 jobs between 2009 and 2025, about half of which would have come between 2011 and 2015. The chart, however, looks at the economic impact of the entire Alberta oil sands on the United States, not just the Keystone XL pipeline. In a subsequent 2011 study, the Canadian Energy Research Institute claimed job growth as a result of the oil sands could reach 600,000 in the United States, but only if existing pipelines were expanded and other projects came to fruition. A spokeswoman for the Canadian Energy Research Institute also said those numbers did not look at the economic benefits of the pipeline, but ""only the benefits from upstream production of oil sands."" Basically, it’s not measuring the benefit from the pipeline itself, rather the study estimates the effects of Canada being able to increase its capacity to produce oil. The study Siciliano showed us is also from 2009. As TransCanada, the company building the pipeline, told us previously, ""The project has changed considerably since then, including substantial route changes and a new presidential permit application."" TransCanada has stopped touting its own study on the the economic benefits of the pipeline from from the same time period, which estimated about 20,000 manufacturing and construction jobs, and another 118,000 spin-off jobs. Instead, in an email to PolitiFact this week, TransCanada pointed us to the State Department’s analysis of the project. According to that study, the Keystone XL pipeline would directly create the equivalent of 16,100 jobs if the project took one year. If the job lasted two years, the equivalent of 8,050 people would be employed over the course of the project. Of those jobs, 5,400 would be in states where the pipeline and support infrastructure will actually get built — Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas. The rest of those direct jobs would be created in other states. In all, about 42,100 jobs would be created over the course of the project — 30,000 of which would be outside the aforementioned four states. This includes jobs created directly by the pipeline (like the construction work), indirectly (like jobs created as a result of goods and services purchased by construction crews) and induced (jobs created by workers spending their wages in the economy). How many of those 30,000 temporary jobs would be in Colorado? It’s not clear from the State Department study, and a spokeswoman for the department said it wasn’t available. Ian Goodman, who co-authored a Cornell University study of the pipeline, said it’s unlikely that Colorado’s chunk of those 30,000 jobs would reach the thousands. Though Colorado could see some benefits from being in a state proximate to the pipeline, it is not expected to be a major supplier to the construction. ""Most of these jobs would be in the states along the pipeline routing and most of the remainder would be in states heavily involved in the spin offs — pipeline supply chain and/or providing goods and services for Keystone XL workers,"" Goodman said. ""Colorado is not likely to have a big roles in these spin-offs. So it is hard to see how Colorado could be getting thousands of jobs from Keystone XL."" Goodman also said TransCanada has already spent about one-third of the pipeline's budget on engineering, design, permitting, and equipment and materials already procured and manufactured. That means that some jobs and economic development from that part of the project have already been realized. In a rosy scenario, Goodman estimated that at most 1,400 additional jobs could be created in Colorado, but more likely it will be less, perhaps closer to 500. As we’ve noted in the past, too, almost all of these jobs are not permanent, as is often the case with construction projects. The State Department found the pipeline would create 35 permanent jobs and 15 temporary jobs once it went into operation. Our ruling Gardner said, ""We would create thousands of jobs in Colorado, if the Keystone Pipeline were to be built."" Gardner based that statement off an old study that measured the overall impact of the Alberta oil sands on the U.S. economy, not the Keystone XL pipeline specifically. The State Department study cited by the company building the pipeline estimates that the equivalent of 30,000 direct, indirect and induced temporary jobs will be created in states outside the pipeline’s projected route. However, it doesn’t specify how many of those would be created in Colorado",Mostly False,"July 31, 2014"
"The United States is the leading nation in the world ""with the highest amount of doubt about the conventional wisdom of climate change.""","After a 26-year crusade against ""environmentalist wackos,"" Rush Limbaugh has emerged triumphant, according to the conservative radio host himself. Citing recent findings by market researchers Ipsos MORI, Limbaugh said on his July 22, 2014, radio show that the United States leads the pack in questioning climate change, and he’s taking all the credit. ""Fifty-four percent of Americans agreed with the statement, 'The climate change we are currently seeing is largely the result of human activity,’ "" he said. ""Why would the U.S. be the leading nation with the highest amount of doubt about the conventional wisdom of climate change? Why do you think that would be?  I think that's exactly right: Me. There's just no other explanation"" Whether Limbaugh is giving praise where praise is due, we can’t know for sure. But we did want to check out his claim that America leads in climate change skepticism. Global lukewarming We’ll start with Limbaugh’s source. In its first-ever Global Trends Survey, Ipsos MORI used an online poll to survey roughly 32,000 adults in 20 countries (Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Great Britain, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the United States.) Respondents were asked about their attitudes on climate change. The countries were then ranked by the percentage who agreed with the statement. Here’s how the U.S. fared:   Statement Agree Disagree Ranking The climate change we are currently seeing is largely the result of human activity  54% 32% 20 We’re headed for environmental disaster unless we change our habits quickly.  57.3% 31.5% 20 The climate change we are currently seeing is a natural phenomenon that happens from time to time 52% 35% 1(tie) I’m tired of the fuss made about the environment. 36% 54% 7 Companies do not pay enough attention to the environment 65% 22% 19 I try to recycle as much as I can. 76% 18% 14 Even the scientists don’t really know what they’re talking about when on environmental issues.  43% 43% 13 The government is just using environmental issues to raise taxes. 50% 35% 17   Based on the results, the United States had the lowest percentage of people say that climate change is: 1. Largely man-made, and 2. Leading the world toward environmental ruin. The United States also tied India for the highest percentage of people agree that climate change is a natural phenomenon that happens from time to time, though more Americans disagreed with the statement than Indians. All of that gives Limbaugh’s claim credence, though there are a couple of caveats. Ipsos MORI research director Bobby Duffy said Limbaugh’s conclusion that the United States is the most skeptical country is ""probably too simple."" While the numbers indicate that the United States is the least likely nation among those surveyed to see climate change as a man-made issue, the majority of Americans -- albeit, not by a huge margin -- still believe that climate change is anthropogenic. Moreover, Americans aren’t scoffing at the general idea of climate change. The United States ranked near the middle of the nations when asked if there is too much of a fuss made about the environment. And Americans recycle at average rates -- though Duffy noted recycling could be motivated by other concerns such as use of resources and socialization. Hockey stick gaffes The survey itself is somewhat limited. While more than 1,000 people were surveyed in some countries including the United States, other countries such as Argentina, Belgium, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Sweden and Turkey included around 500 individuals. Duffy explained that this was due to client interest in the those markets, as Ipsos MORI is a market researcher. Who was surveyed is also important. Ipsos MORI said the survey was representative of the general adult population in ""developed"" (shorthand for greater Internet access) nations such as the United States. But in developing nations, Ispos said it surveyed a ""more affluent and ‘connected’ population"" to represent an emerging middle class, according to Duffy. To some pollsters, this method of surveying is problematic. It doesn’t make sense to compare the elites of one country to the general population of another, said University of Maryland public policy researcher Steven Kull. ""If you’re looking at public opinion in a country, look at the country. If you want to look at a subset, look at a subset. Otherwise it’s apples to oranges,"" he said.   Still, Ipsos’ findings are fairly consistent with the most recent Pew Research Center survey -- where 67 percent of Americans said that there is solid evidence of global warming, and 44 percent say it’s mostly due to human activity. A separate Pew Global poll found that when stacked up against 22 other countries, the United States was one of the least concerned about global warming, right under China and Britain and outranking only Poland and Pakistan. (Interestingly, Ipsos found that 91 percent of people in China said the world was heading for an environmental disaster unless we change our habits. Duffy said this can be explained again by the sampling approach and mode of interview.) One of the most comprehensive polls we found was Gallup’s 2010 survey of 111 countries. Though nearly all Americans were aware of global warming, 47 percent -- the largest percentage in the world -- said it was due to solely natural causes. About half said global warming was at least partly anthropogenic, a 12-percentage-point drop since the last Gallup poll in 2008. That’s slightly below the world’s average but far below the rates in developed countries.  Lower percentages of belief in human-caused climate change in developing nations make sense, given correspondingly lower rates of awareness, education and literacy, said Riley Dunlap, an environmental sociologist at Oklahoma State University. But in the United States, it’s politics that is causing the skepticism. The ruling Limbaugh said that the United States is ""the leading nation with the highest amount of doubt about the conventional wisdom of climate change."" While he cites an exact figure reported by Ipsos MORI, the study itself doesn’t capture the belief of general populations, only those with an Internet connection. Other polls we looked at indicate that a good proportion of developing countries have higher rates of doubt. But among peers, the United States is one of the most -- if not, the most -- skeptical when it comes to believing climate change has human factors",Mostly True,"July 29, 2014"
"""The increase in the garbage tax that [Mayor Allan Fung] imposed in Cranston for some people has been as much as $200.""","Cranston’s new automated trash collection system, approved in February, is just getting under way, but it has already raised a stink.    Ken Block, a Republican candidate for governor, argues that the new program comes at an additional cost. He claims that Cranston Mayor Allan Fung, his gubernatorial primary opponent,  has raised ""the garbage tax"" by ""as much as $200 for some residents.""  Block raised the issue during a debate with Fung on Rhode Island Public Radio on July 15, 2014.  When it was Block’s turn to ask Fung a question, he said,  ""You know, I’ve heard from a number of Cranston residents, including a few CPAs, that the increase in the garbage tax that you’ve imposed in Cranston for some people has been as much as $200 dollars. And for a number of people in Cranston, that’s equivalent to what is in effect a five-percent increase in their property tax … ""So my question to you is: When you talk about not increasing taxes but you’re charging some people the equivalent of 5 percent increase in property taxes, with $200 to collect garbage where they paid much less than the year before, how do you explain that, and do you think that’s acceptable? I hear from a ton of people we talked to in Cranston; they’re very unhappy with this."" In response, Fung said he’d heard from many residents that they’re happy with the new system.  ""I’m not sure where you’re talking about a garbage tax,"" he said. ""We haven’t raised taxes."" Garbage tax? $200 increase? Equivalent to 5-percent tax increase?  Is this just a lot of trash talk? Here are the facts, according to the city’s website and the mayor’s office: Cranston’s new automated trash pickup system,which started in June, is intended to boost the city’s recycling rate from 23 percent to the state’s goal of 35 percent and potentially earn rebates; keep the city cleaner by using closed containers; and reduce the rodent population by using the largely chew-proof barrels. All in all, it should make for a cleaner, sweeter-smelling Cranston with an eased ""critter"" problem.  As part of the program, Cranston residents have received two new, free  65-gallon rolling barrels, one for trash, the other for recyclables. Residents can opt for smaller, 35-gallon bins if the larger ones are too unwieldy.  Residents who want a third barrel must pay $150 per year. There’s another change: the city no longer removes bulky items and appliances for free. Residents must pay $18 per bulky item, and $25 per mattress or box spring.   The bottom line: There is no new ""garbage tax,"" but there new fees for services that were free before. Now let’s examine Block’s claim.  When we asked the Block campaign what he was talking about, they emailed us a five-page response, contending that he was referring to the charge for the optional extra barrels, and the new removal fees for bulky items. We should note that, in his back-and-forth with Fung, Block at one point said: ""You don’t want to call it a tax - let’s call it a fee. They’re now paying a fee …"" But he also used the words ""tax"" or ""taxes"" six times in roughly 30 seconds. In his email, Block explained his math. ""The fact of the matter is that the citizens of Cranston are paying much more for trash removal than they were in the prior year when it was already done as a service paid for by their tax dollars,"" Block wrote. ""Collectively every household that has an extra bin ($150), plus any household that has a large curbside item ($18 per item) adds up to a sum of money that Cranston taxpayers are collectively paying for out of pocket that they didn’t pay for the year before -- call it a fee, call it a tax, call it whatever, but many Cranston residents are now paying more for trash service than they were a year ago."" As for the five percent: ""If a homeowner has an annual property tax bill of $4,000 and he/she needs to purchase an extra bin, and also pay for three curbside items, ""then he /she is paying approximately $300 in new fees, which is a 5% increase over their $4,000 tax bill."" OK, but just a second. How many is ""many"" when we’re talking about people paying for additional bins? Block cites 2008 Environmental Protection Agency estimates that each person in the U.S. ""creates a daily average of 4.5 pounds of solid waste."" From that, Block extrapolates that ""each person creates approximately 30 pounds of solid waste per week"" in concluding that ""larger families will need an extra bin or bins."" Block also noted that the 65-gallon barrels provided in Cranston are smaller than the 90-gallon barrels provided in nearby Warwick. And he noted that residents who previously could discard bulky items such as sofas, carpets and mattresses will now have to pay extra fees.  It’s a little early to predict how many people in Cranston will be paying extra for bulky waste or renting extra bins.  But to date, out of 28,600 residential units that have received barrels, only 80 have requested an additional trash bin - or 0.3 percent, the mayor says.  Fung also called Block’s statement ""false in a number of respects"" and noted that there hasn’t been an increase in property taxes for three years. ""So even if a portion of the regular property tax were to be segregated or designated as paying for refuse removal services, the statement that there has been an ‘increase’ is false, because the overall tax rate has stayed constant for three consecutive years,"" he said. Our ruling During a radio debate, Ken Block said, ""The increase in the garbage tax that [Mayor Allan Fung] imposed in Cranston for some people has been as much as $200."" He then mentioned the word ""tax or taxes"" five more times. But there is no garbage tax. And only those who request an extra barrel or are discarding bulky items and mattresses will pay any extra fees. In fairness, Block later used the word ""fee,"" and ""additional fee."" But we believe the average listener  would conclude that Block was talking about a hike in -- or extra fee beyond -- an existing ""garbage tax."" In addition, Block’s claim that ""many Cranston residents are now paying more for trash service than they were a year ago,"" is sweeping generalization. Only 80 residents have so far requested an extra barrel.  We won’t say that Block’s claim is a whole lot of garbage. But it certainly misleads and exaggerates",False,"July 27, 2014"
"""Although the governor doubled the beach fees . . . all the money, as we found out, is all going to an out-of-state company. The state isn't even getting the money for that.""","Rhode Island dramatically hiked its beach fees in 2011. But according to WPRO talk-show host John DePetro, the state didn’t get any of that extra money. DePetro was talking about tourism on his July 7, 2014 show, when he told his audience this: ""I got so much email from people again complaining just how high the beach fees are. And then we learn this year that although the governor doubled the beach fees, where I think it's 28 bucks if you're from out of state and you want to go to a Rhode Island state beach on the weekend. But on top of that, all the money, as we found out, is all going to an out-of-state company. The state isn't even getting the money for that."" When we emailed DePetro, he said his source was a May 19, 2014, story on WPRI.com, ""Out-of-state company scored when R.I. hiked beach fees."" However, the talk show host is misreporting the facts of the story. Here's the nitty gritty: In 2009, the state went out to bid seeking a vendor to collect fees at the beaches. Propark America, a parking management company based in Hartford, Conn., got the five-year contract, which ends this year. Under the deal, Propark paid the state $1,880,857 for the right to collect fees at the seven state-owned beach facilities. If Propark collected more than that sum, it got to keep the rest until its profit hits $502,143. Beyond that point, once $2,383,000 in beach fees had been collected, the state got 80 cents of every dollar and Propark got 20 cents. Then, in 2011, the General Assembly approved Governor Chafee’s plan to raise money by dramatically increasing the beach fees, effective that July 1. Daily weekday rates went from $6 to $10 for residents and from $12 to $20 for non-residents. Weekend and holiday rates doubled, going to $14 for residents and $28 for non-residents. The price of a season passes also doubled. Seniors get a 50-percent discount. The state’s contract with Propark required the state to share 20 percent of the extra revenue. According to figures from Terrence Maguire, the Department of Environmental Management's assistant director for financial and contract management, Propark's revenue from the contract jumped from $581,039 in 2010 (the summer when the old fees were still in effect), to $734,963 in 2011 (when the old fees remained in effect through June 30). Propark's profit increased to $822,595 in 2012 (the first full year of the higher fees). Last year, the company took in $756,228. But the state was the biggest winner. Revenue from the beach fees, which had been $1.6 million before the increase, jumped to $2.2 million during the transition year and rose further to nearly $2.8 million in 2012. It declined to $2.5 million last year. As a side note, the big losers were the host communities of Charlestown, Westerly, Narragansett and South Kingstown, which initially got 27 percent of the money from the sale of daily passes, for a total of $558,000 in 2010. But in 2011, their share dropped to $344,000. The chief reason: the General Assembly cut the towns' share from 27 percent of the daily fees to 16 percent. But back to DePetro's point. Overall, from 2011 through 2013, Propark made an extra $571,000 because of the increase in beach admission fees. But contrary to DePetro’s claim, the state made nearly five times as much -- $2.6 million extra compared with 2010. The money goes to the state's general fund, not to DEM. One final point. DePetro is correct that Propark is an out-of-state company. However all of Propark's workers at Rhode Island beaches are Rhode Island residents, Maguire said. Our ruling John DePetro said emphatically that ALL of the beach parking revenue generated when the governor raised its fees went to a private company outside Rhode Island. First of all, the governor proposed the fee increase but he didn’t do it on his own. It got the approval of the General Assembly as well. Second, all of the new revenue did not and does not go to the private company. When the state raked in that extra money, Propark got 20 percent of the new revenue. The state might have wanted to take all the additional revenue, but its contract with the company collecting the fees required both to share in the extra revenue. The state got 80 percent of that additional money. DePetro cited WPRI as his source. But while they got the essential facts right, he did not",False Pants on Fire,"July 14, 2014"
"""Without the financial resources provided by hunters to protect habitat and stop poachers, there would be no infrastructure for wildlife management.""","Texas teenage cheerleader Kendall Jones, the hunter who became the hunted, shot back at critics recently, defending her controversial big game hunts as conservation efforts. Jones made news by posting photos of her hunting trip to Zimbabwe on her Facebook page, posing and grinning next to her kills -- including a lion and other big cats. The pictures created an uproar among animal lovers and Jones was labeled the ""most eminently hateable person on the Internet right now.""  But the 19-year-old -- who counts more than 577,000 fans of her Facebook page -- says these outraged animal lovers are missing the point. ""Tanzania also has 15 photo-safari areas, which have been lauded as a non-consumptive alternative to traditional hunting tourism,"" Jones wrote in a July 2, 2014, Facebook post, quoting National Geographic magazine. ""Unfortunately, only 4 of the 15 photo-safari areas are financially viable. The remaining 11 are subsidized by hunter-generated funds. So without the financial resources provided by hunters to protect habitat and stop poachers, there would be no infrastructure for wildlife management."" The point being, if people like Jones didn’t pay to hunt, then wildlife lovers wouldn’t have any animals to look at. We wondered: Is Jones really a misunderstood Artemis or just a wolf in sheep’s clothing? Falling prey to false facts A quick Google search confirmed that the quote Jones referenced is indeed from National Geographic, published Sept. 2, 2013. But it’s from an opinion piece titled ""African Lions Should Not Be Listed as Endangered,"" submitted to the magazine by Melissa Simpson of Safari Club International, a conservation group composed of hunters. Simpson wrote, ""The regulated hunters in Africa make a vital contribution to conservation efforts, primarily through the revenues their hunting expeditions generate for local communities and wildlife resource agencies."" Historically, game reserves in Africa were set up by colonial sport hunters when animal populations began to disappear in the 19th and 20th centuries from over-hunting by early European settlers, according to environmental historian John MacKenzie. But today, sustainable trophy hunting alone is not enough to protect wildlife and stop poachers, said African Wildlife Foundation spokesperson Kathleen Garrigan. It’s just one of a set of ""tools"" used to protect wildlife and habitats. And that’s only under good governance, at a low volume, and with social and economic benefits to local people, according to guidelines set by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), one the world’s leading conservation groups. Others share a similar view on game reserves. Both the International Council for Game and Wildlife Conservation and wildlife conservationists say that hunting tourism can do good for communities and wildlife, where alternatives are not possible. Photo tourism, which needs more capital and infrastructure to implement, won’t work for certain landscapes, says IUCN ecologist Rosie Cooney. ""There are areas with sufficiently low density of animals that no tourist is going to pay thousands of dollars a night to chase them around. In the Serengeti, people will line up two years in advance to see animals because there are scores of them but, in other parts, that’s just not the case,"" said mammal biologist Bruce Paterson. In these areas, especially where human populations are growing, trophy hunting can foot the bill for keeping natural landscapes natural. But assuring healthy animal populations requires hunting operators to be knowledgeable about population dynamics and reasonable about trophy quotas, the age of the animals hunted, profit margins, etc., Paterson said. There are only about 500 West African lions left, which are considered fair game because they’re mistakenly grouped with other African lions instead of their real family, endangered Asian lions. And when trophy hunting is successful in maintaining large wildlife populations and diversity, it’s well-managed, well-regulated, and often paired with other efforts. ""South Africa, through an aggressive conservation initiative that involved ecotourism, hunting, breeding, translocations, and other conservation efforts, was largely responsible for bringing the southern white rhinoceros back from the brink of extinction,"" Garrigan said. Trophy hunting doesn’t do it alone So while experts say trophy hunting can help wildlife management, they agree that it’s just one way to do so. As for which tool is the sharpest in the tool shed, the IUCN says it’s not trophy hunting. With the same level of management and regulation, the conservation results in hunting areas are lower than those obtained by the neighbouring national parks, the IUCN wrote in a 2009 report. In some places, without the proper oversight, the hunting industry is actually contributing to wildlife declines, Garrigan said. On top of that, there’s even less of a bite in the financial argument for trophy hunting. ""Sure, some element of (wildlife management) is happening with fees paid by hunters who go into fishbowls to shoot fish. But the major thrusts are governments and private managers of the photo tours,"" said environmental historian James McCann. Contrary to Jones’ Facebook claim, the non-consumptive tourism sector -- meaning you can look but you can’t touch -- is overall more profitable than trophy hunting. Botswana recently banned hunting in favor of high-cost, low-density ecotourism. Tanzania’s national park system actually receives about $11 million annually from just one photographic tourism area, whereas hunting revenue altogether averages $10.5 million, according to wildlife conservationist Peter Lindsey. ""Photographic ecotourism undoubtedly generates greater gross revenues than trophy hunting in Africa, and where large numbers of tourists visit, employment opportunities for local peoples can be higher than just  hunting,"" Lindsey wrote in a widely cited 2006 study that actually recommends trophy hunting. Hunting groups including Safari International, NGOs and academics alike report that the entire trophy hunting industry generates about $200 million in annual revenue, $100 million in South Africa alone.  But this figure, which comes from Lindsey’s study, is questionable, says the Economists at Large in their 2013 report. The $100 million figure, for example, was taken from an unpublished study by the Professional Hunters Association of South Africa. Whatever the number, trophy hunting revenue is a small slice of the pie. Altogether the IUCN reports that the hunters are contributing all of 1.3 percent of tourism revenue in the big game countries, and have created 0.0001 percent of the jobs (and most are part time). Averaged out over land used, hunting generates less than $2 per hectare -- about $1 if we exclude South Africa -- and moreover, local communities get just a dime of that. In Tanzania, where the financial contribution by game revenue is the highest, hunting contributes to about 0.3 percent of the national budget but uses about a quarter of land. Our ruling Jones, who has been criticized for posting photos of big game kills while visiting in Africa, claimed that, ""Without the financial resources provided by hunters to protect habitat and stop poachers, there would be no infrastructure for wildlife management."" First, while the quote was published in National Geographic, it was written as part of a pro-hunting opinion piece. Second, the claim is inaccurate.

"Says Greg Abbott ""has lost"" in court ""four times in just the past few days.""","State Sen. Wendy Davis wink-admonished delegates to last month’s Texas Democratic Party convention not to ""clap too much"" for her ""or Greg Abbott will sue you."" Davis, the party’s nominee for governor, then noted that Abbott, the state attorney general and Republican gubernatorial choice, often boasts about going to work, suing the federal government and going home. In May 2013, we rated as True Abbott’s claim he’d sued President Barack Obama’s administration 25 times. ""He is so proud of that,"" Davis said. ""But what he doesn’t say is that our judges go to work; they rule against him and the people of this state win. In fact, he has lost four times in just the past few days. If he... were your lawyer,"" Davis said, ""you would fire him on the spot."" Four Abbott losses in a June jiffy? Davis's list of Abbott's ""losses"" By email, Davis spokesman Zac Petkanas pointed out news stories published over a week in June 2014 describing court actions while Abbott’s office separately responded that Davis failed to note key details. Let’s walk through how Davis backed up her statement before laying out Abbott’s objections. On June 16, 2014, according to a Dallas Morning News blog post, a state appeals court ruled a former Texas assistant attorney general, Ginger Weatherspoon, could proceed with her lawsuit charging she’d been fired for refusing to lie under oath about a judge. The story said: ""The AG’s office has spent years trying to get the suit tossed, claiming, among other things, that Weatherspoon didn’t make a ‘good faith’ effort to blow the whistle to the right links in the chain of command. A three-justice panel disagreed, and issued an opinion Monday written by Justice David Evans that said Dallas County Judge Martin Hoffman did the right thing last year when he refused to grant the AG’s office its request for summary judgment."" In the opinion, Evans said Weatherspoon reported suspected criminal violations to appropriate authorities inside the attorney general’s office. She ""has sufficiently alleged that she made good faith report of a violation of law by another public employee to an appropriate law enforcement authority,"" Evans wrote. According to a June 18, 2014, news story in the Austin American-Statesman, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., ordered the state to pay almost $1.1 million in legal fees to lawyers who represented Davis and minority rights groups in a legal challenge to district boundaries drawn by the Republican-majority Legislature. The story said: ""U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer’s order criticized lawyers in"" Abbott’s ""office for submitting a legal brief that devoted more effort to complaining than it did to answering the legal issues in the fight over lawyer fees."" Collyer, an appointee of President George W. Bush, wrote: ""This matter presents a case study in how not to respond to a motion for attorney fees and costs."" Five days later, a state judge had spurned Abbott’s attempt to remove state District Judge John Dietz from presiding over the long-running public school finance case, the Statesman reported. Abbott, facing a likely legal defeat in the case as a whole, had argued emails showed the judge was biased in favor of school district lawyers seeking to have the state’s school-finance system declared unconstitutional, the story said. Visiting Judge David Peeples found Dietz had ""acted in good faith, holding out-of-court conversations with plaintiffs lawyers because ‘he believed that all parties had agreed to let such discussions take place,’"" the story said. The same day, the Texas Tribune summed up a U.S. Supreme Court ruling as the ""latest loss for Texas in its ongoing campaign against the federal government and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency."" The Tribune news story went on to say the court had ""largely dismissed"" Abbott’s ""challenge of federal climate rules. Seven justices agreed that the EPA is allowed to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from most large industrial facilities, like power plants and factories."" Based on the accounts offered by Davis, it looks like Abbott experienced an unappealable loss at the Supreme Court (the EPA case), the loss clearing the way for a former employee to have her day in court, plus two losses that could yet lead to appeals courts making win-or-loss rulings. Abbott's office objects Abbott's state spokesman, Jerry Strickland, said the turns were not so clear-cut. Besides, Strickland told us by email, Davis failed to note a criminal prosecution simultaneously completed by Abbott’s office. According to a Statesman news story posted online June 20, 2014, a Bastrop County jury sentenced a former teacher to 15 years in prison for sexually assaulting a student; the attorney general’s office handled the case after the Bastrop County district attorney’s office recused itself. Of course, Davis didn’t say Abbott had four losses uninterrupted. Strickland said of three of the results Davis was referencing: The decision enabling the former employee’s lawsuit to proceed was only procedural. ""Citing the decision as a loss when the case hasn’t even gone before a judge is like saying a team won the game because they won the pre-game coin flip,"" Strickland said. The D.C. judge who awarded attorney fees also issued a stay on the decision, pausing her order so the state could appeal. The decision not to order Dietz’s removal from the school funding lawsuit didn’t determine how the finance lawsuit itself will be judged on the state’s appeal to the Texas Supreme Court. ""No matter what happens on any day, in any motions in the school finance case, those decisions along the way are not the final word,"" Strickland said. Past those, Strickland said Abbott won the EPA case ""on the issues we argued."" Specifically, Strickland said, the high court overturned the EPA’s illegal greenhouse gas permitting scheme after determining that it ignored federal law, exceeded the authority granted the agency by Congress and violated the federal Clean Air Act. ""That was precisely what the state argued and thus, this was a win"" for Abbott, Strickland said. The court’s decision affirmed and reversed, in part, a lower court’s ruling in EPA’s favor. The justices basically said the EPA had exceeded its statutory authority when it interpreted the Clean Air Act to require certain kinds of permitting for industrial plants based on their greenhouse-gas emissions. On the other hand, the court concluded, the agency may continue to treat greenhouse gases as a pollutant subject to regulation under federal law. Expert analyst revisits EPA ruling For expert perspective, we asked Lyle Denniston, a reporter who analyzes Supreme Court decisions for the online Supreme Court of the United States blog, to speak to how Abbott and the state of Texas fared in the EPA case. Denniston said by email that states including Texas made arguments that paralleled those offered by lawyers for business firms--and those arguments prevailed. Specifically, he said, the states said EPA couldn’t bootstrap its regulation of greenhouse gases from motor vehicle exhausts into a broad regime of regulating greenhouse gases from industrial plants. Still, Denniston said, Texas fell short of a complete victory because the court didn’t agree the EPA has no authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and other stationary sources. Rather, he wrote, the court decided EPA could regulate greenhouse gases from sources already that were obliged, under law, to curb air pollution--meaning the agency could regulate 83 percent of greenhouse gas sources instead of the 86 percent that would have come under its regulatory sway if the administration’s broadest argument had stuck, Denniston said. Strickland, provided Denniston’s comments, cautioned against reading the high court’s ruling too narrowly. The case, Strickland emailed, ""was about separation of powers, and the limits of EPA's authority. The court rebuked what they saw as a federal government that tried to rewrite the rules and laws, without legislative approval. This is a victory"" for Abbott. Our ruling Davis said Abbott ""has lost"" in court ""four times in just the past few days."" Abbott sustained four legal setbacks, we conclude, but the Democrat's statement needs clarification. Three rulings could prove to be bumps along the road o’ litigation possibly culminating in Abbott wins. And in the EPA case, the justices partly agreed with Texas, though they upheld federal regulation of greenhouse gases as pollutants. Notably, too, just one of the referenced rulings involved the Obama administration",Mostly True,"July 6, 2014"
"""There are already more American jobs in the solar industry than in coal mining.""","For more than a year, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse has delivered weekly Senate speeches about the dangers of climate change. He frequently denounces climate-change deniers, and urges growth of green jobs and technologies to reduce America’s reliance on foreign fossil fuel. In a May 27, 2014 commentary in The Providence Journal, Whitehouse argued for a nationwide price on carbon pollution. And he expressed hope for a prosperous, clean-energy future and faith that ""there is more economic security in our own American know-how than in corrupt foreign fossil fuel countries."" To that end, Whitehouse noted that there ""are already more American jobs in the solar industry than in coal mining."" This claim is reminiscent of his November 2012 statement that ""we have more people working in clean and green energy than in oil and gas in this country."" (PolitiFact Rhode Island ruled that claim as True.) The solar industry has seen tremendous growth.  But have solar industry jobs actually eclipsed the number of coal-mining jobs? Whitehouse communications director Seth Larson cited two sources to back up the senator’s claim. The first is a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report issued in May 2013 that counts an estimated 80,030 jobs for all occupations within the coal-mining  industry -- a sector of the coal industry as a whole. For solar jobs, Larson cited The Solar Foundation’s ""National Solar Jobs Census 2013,"" which states that the solar industry ""employs 142,698 Americans as of November 2013."" First, let’s look at coal-mining jobs. We checked with the Bureau of Labor Statistics and found that Whitehouse had quoted the May 2013 number correctly. (The more recent April 2014 BLS month survey counted  78,500 coal-mining jobs. Neither of those include self-employed contractors.) BLS press officer Gary Steinberg said its estimated numbers are drawn from ""an annual survey of employers, by occupation,"" based on data sent by businesses. They reflect jobs, not people. We also found three other sets of coal-mining numbers. Spoiler alert: they are not all apples-to-apples. They use different methodologies and different definitions. But they provide an overall picture. A 2013 report from the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration cited 123,227 jobs -- substantially more than the BLS, but still less than the number of solar jobs Whitehouse cited. MHSA surveys the mines themselves as opposed to the companies, and therefore includes contractors as well as regular workers.    SNL Energy, a leading energy data provider, analyzes MSHA data to capture ""snapshot"" industry trends. Its June 2014 report, ""U.S. coal miner employment sustains free fall beyond 2nd year,"" cites an 8.3% drop in  the one-year period ending March 31, to 79,658 employees. That excludes contractors and 33 not-yet-reported mines.   By contrast, the National Mining Association, a trade group, counted 195,494 coal-mining jobs in 2012. The breakdown: miners (including contractors): 137,650; support activities: 6,930; transportation: 50,914. That’s nearly 53,000 more than Whitehouse’s solar jobs number. Spokeswoman Nancy Gravatt said the NMA maintains that the additional support services ""should be included because all of these activities are integral to the daily work in the mines."" But the NMA’s definition of coal-mining jobs goes far beyond those used by the federal agencies, including such transportation workers as railroad engineers and seamen on coal freighters. In other words, data from three sources supports Whitehouse’s claim. The NMA count does not. Now let’s check out the solar data. Larson cited The Solar Foundation’s ""National Solar Jobs Census 2013,"" which states that the solar industry ""employs 142,698 Americans as of November 2013."" The Solar Foundation is an independent, national 501(c)(3) nonprofit, non-lobbying group, that strives ""to increase the widespread adoption of solar energy through educational outreach, policy research, and market transformation."" Their data is considered ""the most authoritative"" by the Congressional Research Service. Its report defines ""solar workers"" as those who spend ""at least 50 percent of their time supporting solar-related activities."" According to its 2013 census, ""approximately 91 percent of those who meet our definition of a solar worker spent 100 percent of their time working on solar."" Andrea Luecke, the foundation’s executive director, said the foundation surveys the ""known universe"" of self-identified solar companies, of which there are about 6,000 nationwide. ""We go out directly to those companies. This year, we made 74,000 phone calls and sent 11,000 emails,"" over the course of one month. The foundation also surveys companies ""that help supply the ‘known universe’ with raw materials,"" Luecke said. ""It’s a census approach, so we’re doing a direct count and extrapolate to get national numbers, which is how the BLS does it."" Luecke said by the census report’s measure, ""the solar industry is outpacing coal mining."" But she noted, ""You have to understand that coal-mining is one aspect of the coal industry - whereas we’re talking about the whole solar industry."" If you add in other coal industry categories, ""it’s more than solar, for sure. But the coal-mining bucket is less, for sure."" Our ruling: Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said that solar industry jobs have now outpaced coal-mining jobs. The most recent data from three objective sources support his claim. The one source that offered a contrary view, the National Mining Association, cited two-year-old numbers and counted categories such as off-site transportation workers on coal barges and ocean freighters",True,"July 6, 2014"
"""Congressman (Tom) Cotton is the only Arkansan in Congress -- Democrat or Republican -- to vote against disaster relief five times.""","Democrats are attacking Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., for his voting record on an important Tornado Alley issue. A television ad produced by the liberal Senate Majority PAC shows video footage of tornadoes and a storm-ravaged town. The narrator, a firefighter identified as Matthew from Little Rock, goes on to criticize Cotton, who is running for Senate, for voting against disaster relief. ""I'll never understand why Congressman Cotton is the only Arkansan in Congress -- Democrat or Republican -- to vote against disaster relief five times, against recovery for victims of natural disasters. He's detached himself from what's going on in Arkansas,"" he said. The federal government most recently declared a disaster in Arkansas this past April, when a tornado killed 16 people -- the deadliest tornado in the state since 1968. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has spent about $5 million on disaster relief there, without having to seek Congressional approval. Cotton, who is running against incumbent Democrat Mark Pryor, has been in Congress for less than two years -- has he voted against disaster relief five times? Senate Majority PAC spokesman Ty Matsdorf pointed us to the five times they found Cotton had voted against disaster relief since he took office in January 2013. Four out of the five have to do with funding Hurricane Sandy relief (three of those were all on one bill). The votes are: Vote 1: H.R. 41, January 2013 Cotton voted against a measure to temporarily increase FEMA's borrowing authority in order to carry out the National Flood Insurance Program in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The measure passed the House 354-67 and became law. Vote 2: H.R. 152, January 2013 Cotton voted against an amendment that proposed $17 billion in emergency funding to FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The measure passed the House 327-91. Vote 3: H.R. 152, January 2013 Cotton voted against an amendment that proposed $33.7 billion for immediate and anticipated needs in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The measure passed the House 228-192. Vote 4: H.R. 152, January 2013 Cotton voted against the final bill that would give $50 billion in disaster relief aid to communities and FEMA in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The measure passed the House 241 and 180 and became law. Vote 5:  H.R. 3547, January 2014 Cotton voted against this omnibus appropriations bill that appropriated money to the Disaster Relief Fund. The bill passed the House 359 to 67 and became law. Of Arkansas’ four Republican representatives, Cotton is the only one to have voted ""no"" on all five of those measures. But two of them -- Timothy Griffin and and Steve Womack -- voted ""no"" on final passage for the final Hurricane Sandy funding bill, while Rick Crawford voted ""no' on H.R. 3547, the omnibus appropriations bill.  In the Senate, H.R. 41 passed with a voice vote, where the votes aren’t tallied. Pryor approved both of the other two bills. Republican Sen. John Boozman, however, voted ""no"" on H.R. 152, the Hurricane Sandy bill. We should note that none of these votes involved specific disaster relief for Arkansas. However, H.R. 3547 was a general appropriations bill covering many areas, a small part of which had to do with funding general disaster relief. And H.R. 152 included $16 billion for community development in declared disaster areas across the country.  Cotton’s office didn't respond to our questions, but a post on his campaign website defends his disaster relief record regarding Hurricane Sandy. ""Unfortunately, Washington politicians took advantage of a tragic situation and loaded down the Sandy relief bill with billions in spending that didn’t help the victims but instead went to fund the pet causes of Congressmen,"" it says. At the time, some conservatives criticized H.R. 152, the final Hurricane Sandy aid bill, for including funds that didn’t go to immediate disaster relief. According to a Congressional Quarterly analysis, $17 billion went to immediate aid, and $33.5 billion went to long-term assistance. The budget group Taxpayers for Common Sense documented some of the side projects Cotton and his colleagues were trying to trim out of the bill, such as $2 million for Smithsonian museum roof repairs and $118 million on Amtrak upgrades.   And Cotton’s votes on H.R. 152 weren’t all negative. For example, he voted ""yes"" on at least five (failed) amendments that cut funds in other areas in order to account for the additional spending on disaster relief. He also voted ""yes"" on a later bill that expanded the type of nonprofit organization that could provide disaster aid and assistance. In reviewing Cotton’s votes, we found Cotton has tended to side with tea party members of the House looking to rein in government spending at any cost. For example, he was part of the coalition that supported shutting down the federal government over raising the debt ceiling. Cotton has been ""unusually steadfast in his opposition to spending,"" said Janine Parry, a political science professor at the University of Arkansas. ""The main undertone I hear when the Pryor allies run an ad like that is another effort to paint (Cotton) as outside the mainstream, even extremist,"" Parry said. Our ruling  A Senate Majority PAC ad said, ""Congressman Cotton is the only Arkansan in Congress -- Democrat or Republican -- to vote against disaster relief five times."" We found that Cotton voted against five bills or amendments that would have gone to immediate aid or funded disaster relief programs. The rest of the Arkansas delegation only voted ""no"" on some of them. However, the ad is a bit disengenuous because it really only addresses three disaster relief bills, and a couple of other Arkansan delegates voted against final passage. The ad also leaves out the times that Cotton voted for disaster relief funding, as long as there were spending cuts to other programs to make up for it. Overall, Cotton typically doesn’t support spending that isn’t balanced out with cuts in other areas. Additionally, if you think this ad -- which shows tornado-ravaged areas -- is talking all about Arkansas, that isn't the case. Most of these votes had to do with Hurricane Sandy",Half True,"July 1, 2014"
"Says Iowa Senate candidate Joni Ernst ""promises to shut down the Department of Education and abolish the EPA.""","A new ad from a coalition of environmental groups tries to paint Iowa’s Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst as too extreme. The groups, which include the League of Conservation Voters, the Sierra Club, and the Environmental Defense Action Fund, kicked off a nearly $1 million campaign with a 30 second TV spot on June 23, 2014. The ad raises concern over Ernst’s promises ""to shut down the Department of Education and abolish the EPA.""  It claims that these promises are ""why extremist Sarah Palin and the billionaire Koch brother want Ernst in Washington."" All in all, the ad concluded that Ernst is ""Too extreme for Iowa."" It’s not unusual for political ads to distort candidate’s positions. Does Ernst really call for the abolition of the U.S. Education Department and the Environmental Protection Agency? Our research showed that the ad was right on track. Ernst called for the closure of both agencies in April. Will she do away with the Education Department? Ernst is a state senator who won the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate. She’s running against the Democratic nominee, U.S. Rep. Bruce Braley. Ernst brought up both the Education Department and the EPA in the Republican primary debate on April 24, 2014. One of the moderators asked candidates how they would fund repairs for the nation’s ""crumbling road and transportation systems."" Ernst suggested cutting the federal budget to free up funds. ""I do believe that we can make the cuts necessary within our federal government,"" Ernst said. She called for ""closing the doors to the Department of Education at the federal level. And not just because it would save taxpayer dollars, but because I do believe our children are better educated when it’s coming from the state."" We ran those comments by Ernst spokeswoman Gretchen Hamel, who said that Ernst wants to see power taken from Washington and put back in the hands of Iowans. She is ""about state-driven policy,"" Hamel said. According to the Education Department’s website the ""federal role in education is limited."" States handle almost all education policy and issues. But, at the federal level, the Education Department takes on many tasks such as conducting research and overseeing state policy to prevent discrimination. It also awards and distributes federal financial aid in the form of loans and grants. The ad says that if Ernst is elected, 213,000 Iowa students would lose their federal Pell Grants. According to federal numbers, that is the number of Iowans who received Pell Grants in 2011-12. We asked the Ernst campaign what her plan for Pell Grants is, but we didn’t get a response. What about the EPA? While answering the same question that prompted her Education Department response, Ernst also mentioned the EPA. ""Let’s shut down the EPA,"" she said. Ernst gave the same rationale for this slash in government, saying, ""The state knows best how to protect resources."" So, the ad is on solid ground. Ernst did say that she would shut down the EPA. Agriculture and manufacturing are two of Iowa’s key industries, and they are both heavily affected by EPA regulation. Hamel, Ernst’s spokeswoman, said that ""Joni wants to have Iowa make its own decisions."" The ad also refers to the Clean Air Act. This raises the question of how states would deal with national issues, like air pollution. Unlike the Education Department, where the states already play a huge role, this could be more complicated for the EPA. Two experts on environmental law told us that abolishing the EPA would dramatically reduce regulations on industry. ""Nearly all states have seen significant cuts in the budgets of their state environmental agencies in recent years,""  said one of them, Joel A. Mintz, a law professor at Nova Southeastern University who specializes in environmental law. ""Although some states may have the expertise, resources and political will to subsume EPA’s responsibilities, many — probably most — do not.""

"""NASA scientists fudged the numbers to make 1998 the hottest year to overstate the extent of global warming.""","On climate change, Gallup pollsters say Americans divide into three groups -- the ""Concerned Believers,"" the ""Mixed Middle,"" and the ""Cool Skeptics."" Believers have a slender plurality at 39 percent but skeptics make up a solid 25 percent. They think there’s little to worry about and that media reports on the topic are exaggerated. Fox News host Steve Doocy gave the doubters some ammunition on June 24, 2014. In a segment on Fox and Friends called ""News by the Numbers,"" Doocy drew viewers’ attention to the year 1934. ""That's the hottest year on record in the United States,"" Doocy said. ""At least until NASA scientists fudged the numbers to make 1998 the hottest year to overstate the extent of global warming. The 1930s were by far the hottest decade in the United States."" A reader wondered if NASA really did cook the books (we love reader suggestions!), so we are checking Doocy’s claim about fudging the numbers. We asked Fox News for their source and while they didn’t respond, a number of conservative news outlets have made much in recent days of a blog post from a man who writes under the pseudonym Steven Goddard. Goddard charged that until 2000, NASA reported that in the United States, 1934 was hotter than 1998 and that the country has been cooling since then. ""Right after the year 2000, NASA and NOAA dramatically altered U.S. climate history, making the past much colder and the present much warmer,"" Goddard wrote. He provided this animated chart to prove his point (the chart marked ""a"" is the old version):  Climate science experts say not so fast Doocy exaggerated the findings in this blog post when he applied it to global warming. The post itself only talks about U.S. land temperatures and what happens in the United States is separate from global shifts. As far as what the blog actually claimed, while it accurately copied the changes in the government charts, experts in U.S. temperature measurement say it ignores why the charts shifted. There were major changes in how the country gathered temperature information over the decades. Zeke Hausfather is a data scientist with Berkeley Earth, a research group that has expressed doubts about some of the reports on climate change coming from Washington and international bodies. Hausfather took Goddard to task when Goddard made a similar claim about numbers fudging earlier this month. The missing piece in Goddard’s analysis, Hausfather said, was he ignored that the network of weather stations that feed data to the government today is not the one that existed 80 years ago. ""He is simply averaging absolute temperatures,"" Hausfather wrote. ""Absolute temperatures work fine if and only if the composition of the station network remains unchanged over time."" Weather stations that once were in a valley might now be on a hill top and vice versa. But the shift could be greater than simple elevation. Stations were moved from one part of a state to another. The number of stations within a given area shifted. All these differences, Hausfather and other experts said, will alter the typical temperatures gathered by government meteorologists. Gavin Schmidt, director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said the raw data used in the blog post suffered from an equally troubling flaw. The temperatures were not measured at the same time of day. ""Over time, the U.S. network went from recording max/min temperatures at different points of the day, to doing it at midnight,"" Schmidt said. In fact, volunteers staffed many of the stations. Before 1940, most followed Weather Service guidelines and recorded the temperature at sundown. Through the second half of the century, there was a gradual shift to recording morning temperatures. This change produced the appearance of a cooling trend when none existed. Comparing apples to apples Better instruments and more consistent methods have allowed scientists to collect more reliable data. But for climate studies, long-term trends are key and the challenge has been how to make the best use of the older readings. In the mid 1980s, the government settled on a list of about 1,200 stations across the country to track temperature trends. Around 1990, climatologists began delivering computer programs to factor in the artificial changes that systematically pushed the readings one way or the other. Over time, they accounted for the impacts of equipment, location, the time of day of measurements and urbanization (more asphalt leads to higher surface temperatures). There is no question that running the raw data through these programs changes the graphs of average temperatures. However, multiple researchers from a variety of institutions have fed into this process and come up with their own computer models. Results from different teams largely match up. John Nielsen-Gammon is a researcher at Texas A&M University and is the Texas state climatologist. Nielsen-Gammon finds nothing nefarious in the government analysis of temperature trends. ""It is reasonable to expect the adjusted data record to change over time as the technology for identifying and removing artificial changes improves,"" Nielsen-Gammon said. ""If there are any biases, they are caused by the quality of the underlying data, not by any biases intentionally introduced into the adjustment process."" All of the experts we reached or whose work we read rejected Goddard’s conclusions. Mark  C. Serreze, professor of geography at the University of Colorado-Boulder, said no fabrication has taken place. ""Goddard's results stem from an erroneous analysis of the data,"" Serreze said. Anthony Watts, a popular skeptic of most climate change data, posted his objection to Goddard’s claim. ""I took Goddard to task over this as well in a private email, saying he was very wrong and needed to do better,"" Watts wrote. Our ruling Doocy with Fox News said NASA scientists fudged the numbers to overstate the extent of global warming. This exaggerated the thrust in the underlying blog post. It accused government scientists of altering the U.S. temperature record, not the record for the entire earth. As for what the blog said, we found that experts across the spectrum found fundamental flaws in its analytic methods. By relying on raw data, it ignored that the number and location of weather stations and the methods of measuring temperatures across the United States have changed greatly over the past 80 years. The experts we reached or whose work we read generally agree that the corrections for flawed data produce valid results. The bare bones approach used in the blog post provides no solution to the issues of weaknesses in the raw data",False Pants on Fire,"June 25, 2014"
"The proposed Gogebic iron ore mine is ""just up the hill"" from the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore caves along Lake Superior.","Controversy over the proposed Gogebic Taconite mine in far northern Wisconsin plays out in familiar fashion in ""Wisconsin’s Mining Standoff,"" a documentary airing on the Al Jazeera America cable network. Co-produced by Milwaukee-based 371 Productions and Al Jazeera for the network’s weekly Fault Lines program, the film calls the debate over the proposed mine ""a battle for the very soul of the state….pitting those who wish to extract natural resources against those who wish to preserve them."" The piece about the mine was broadcast for the first time June 14, 2014. Al Jazeera America, which launched in 2013, is available in 52 million homes. Fault Lines also airs internationally on the Al Jazeera English cable network, which is not available in the United States. (Al Jazeera doesn’t provide an online link to the segment.) The film is also being screened throughout Wisconsin by 371 Productions. The documentary opens with a panorama of hundreds of bundled-up folks tramping across frozen Lake Superior to view scenic ice caves. Those spectacular caves, in the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore about 20 miles west of Bayfield, are normally only accessible by kayak or canoe. When the lake froze over the winter for the first time since 2009, the caves received considerable attention, and a record number of visitors. Standing on the frozen lake, Al Jazeera correspondent Josh Rushing refers to the importance of tourism to northern Wisconsin, discusses the size of the proposed mine and raises a question that’s an important theme in the 25 minute documentary. ""Will all of these tourists want to come here if there’s an iron mine just up the hill?"" he asks. The ""just up the hill"" impression is reinforced by the editing of the piece. In the opening minute, the film moves back and forth from the ice caves to the Penokee mountain range where the mine would be built.  It shows heavy equipment digging into the earth -- part of initial rock sampling now under way -- and huge trucks rumbling down a snow covered road, then switches back to the frozen lake and the ice caves. There’s one problem: The mine and the caves are more than an hour apart. Google maps says it’s about 54 miles from Cornucopia, the town near the caves, to Mellen, the community closest to the proposed mine site. It would take 70 minutes to make the trip, according to Google. It’s not like this was an out-of-town correspondent losing his bearings in the North Woods. The script was written by 371 founder Brad Lichtenstein, who is also listed in the credits as director, senior producer and a principal photographer. Milwaukee-based 371 proposed the topic to Fault Lines and did much of the work on the segment. The company produced the 2012 documentary ""As Goes Janesville,"" which included footage of Gov. Scott Walker telling a wealthy supporter he would use a ""divide and conquer"" strategy against unions. When we asked the 371 Productions about the ""just up the hill"" statement, we didn’t receive a response from the company. Instead, we heard from Al Jazeera in New York, which issued a statement that said the film would be edited due to our inquiry. ""While we consider Josh’s statement to be a figure of speech that helps viewers understand the area broadly as a tourist destination, we can also understand that some viewers might take his narration to imply an exact measurement of the distance between him and the mine site,"" the statement said. ""Because of the potential for confusion, we are removing this line of narration."" Impact on the lakeshore That aside, could the mine hurt the Apostle Islands lakeshore? The mine site is some 20 miles inland, but there is plenty of concern from neighbors and the nearby Bad River band of the Lake Superior Chippewa that the project could pollute the Bad River, which flows into Lake Superior. But the mouth of the Bad River is miles away from the caves and on the opposite side of the Bayfield peninsula. The state Department of Natural Resources is responsible for enforcing federal clean water rules. DNR hydrogeologist Larry Lynch, the agency’s top administrator overseeing the mine project, said it’s too early to study any impact that a mine could have on the Bad River watershed and Lake Superior, because the mining company has not provided a specific plan for the project. For instance, Lynch said, if Gogebic plans a waste water treatment facility, would water be discharged into the river? If so, would the trip downstream dilute that discharge before it reaches the lake? ""It would be a very involved process, obviously,"" Lynch said of the DNR water quality review. Gogebic Taconite spokesman Bob Seitz said the company had not studied the potential impact of the mine on tourism. He noted the site itself might draw visitors to what is a remote part of the state. ""I am confident an operating mine (or one under construction) would bring far more people to this area daily to use tourism related businesses than currently visit the immediate area,"" Seitz said in an email. ""Mines also draw tourists to view the project. I would anticipate some kind of overlook like mines in other places have to draw visitors."" Other statements  The Fault Lines piece included several other statements similar to ones we have reviewed. The documentary states that the project ""would start with a 4.5 mile pit and could eventually stretch 22 miles."" In another spot, he describes the mine as a ""half mile trench that could eventually stretch 22 miles through the wilderness."" That’s similar to a claim from writer and musician Dan Kaufman that the mine ""could be extended as long as 21 miles."" We rated that Half True. While that is the size of the ore deposit that Gogebic holds the rights to, the first phase calls for a four-mile site to be mined. Tentative plans call for it to be not a single trench, but two separate pits. Any additional mining would require another permitting process and would be decades away -- and only if the company decides it’s worth the effort. And it would not be a single pit, but a series of excavations, Lynch and the company have said. The program also mentions the state law written to make it easier for the company to develop the mine. The law allows the company to fill in streams and ponds providing it re-creates the bodies of water elsewhere, the program notes",Mostly True,"June 23, 2014"
"""It was Dan Sullivan who wrote a bill to cut Alaskans out of those decisions"" about where they can hunt and fish.","In a state where fishing and hunting are a way of life, it's no surprise that the issue is packing a punch in the Alaska Senate race, a high-profile race in which incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Begich is seeking a second term. Put Alaska First -- a political action committee funded by the Senate Majority PAC, which has close ties to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. -- released a television ad blasting Republican candidate Dan Sullivan for his involvement in crafting a controversial state bill that, according to the ad, would affect Alaskans’ input on fishing and hunting policy. The ad features Sam Cotten, a resident of Eagle River, Alaska, and a former state senator, saying, ""The fishing industry is part of who we are here in Alaska. When decisions are being made about where we can hunt, where we can fish, Alaskan voices shouldn't be taken out of the picture."" The ad then cuts to a narrator, who says, ""But it was Dan Sullivan who wrote the bill to cut Alaskans out of those decisions."" We wondered whether Sullivan, one of two leading candidates in the GOP primary, had really made that kind of power grab, so we took a closer look. Who’s behind the bill? The claim stems from a piece of controversial legislation presented to the Alaska State Legislature in January 2013. House Bill 77, supported by the state Department of Natural Resources, aimed to improve and speed up the process for approving land and water-use permits. Most of the public outcry focused on a provision in the original draft that would in some cases have allowed the DNR to award general-use permits without giving the public the opportunity to review or comment on the proposals. The bill also took away the right of tribes, groups and individuals to secure in-stream fishing areas that were protected from mining and other development projects. The bill's main critics were fishers, tribal groups, conservation groups and people who felt the DNR was taking power away from individuals. Hundreds of people signed up to offer public testimony against the legislation, and few stood up to support it. When the bill was introduced, Sullivan was the Commissioner of Natural Resources, and by most accounts, he was deeply involved in the overarching effort to overhaul the permitting system and reduce backlogs. ""Whether he personally penned any part of the bill is uncertain, but he definitely had some influence,"" said Carl Shepro, a political science professor emeritus at the University of Alaska. ""That lends some credence to the statement"" in the ad, he said. Throughout his tenure as commissioner, which ended in the fall of 2013, Sullivan defended the DNR’s efforts to change with the permitting system. ""I led that effort, and I’m proud of that effort,"" Sullivan said in an interview with Radio Kenai in March 2014, referring to his overall strategy to overhaul the permitting system. But the bill's language was broad, so critics were worried that the DNR could potentially permit large-scale and high-impact projects -- such as mining -- without public input. That, in turn, could have handed the commissioner -- Sullivan, at the time -- significantly more power. However, the ad glosses over a few nuances. First, the ad doesn’t note that the bill failed to make it through the Alaska Legislature in 2013, largely due to public opposition, and again in 2014. Second, the ad’s wording suggests that Sullivan’s sole intent was to cut out public discussion of permitting decisions, when in fact that was a byproduct of a broader effort to improve the permitting process. The idea of the original bill was that the commissioner should be able to issue a permit for small-scale proposals -- such as allowing someone to dock their boat near their waterfront property -- without notifying the public. And third, the ad may have exaggerated the potential impact of the measure, implying that the bill would have kept Alaskans out of discussions regarding hunting, rather than just fishing. Some HB 77 critics have said the broad language would have allowed it to affect hunting, because land access plays a big role in hunting, Shepro said. If the DNR limited land use through the authority granted under HB 77’s original draft, the department could have restricted hunting without having to go through public review processes. Still, this is speculative. The bill’s text does not make any reference to hunting or game activity. And judging by what the law’s critics complained about, the main concerns centered on fishing, not hunting. The Sullivan campaign said the law would not affect the Alaska Department of Fish and Game’s regulatory authority over hunting. But the ad’s creators thought the bill’s language created a slippery slope. ""If you are a hunter, and you hunt a popular state-owned tract of land, the commissioner can hand that land over to a developer without a public hearing and without adhering to existing laws and (regulations), under HB 77,"" said Jim Lottsfeldt, Put Alaska First senior adviser. Our Ruling: Put Alaska First PAC said in a television ad that Sullivan ""wrote a bill to cut Alaskans out of"" decisions about where citizens can hunt and fish. As commissioner of natural resources, Sullivan did indeed push legislation to limit the public's ability to review and comment on development proposals. However, the ad glosses over a few complicating issues, including the stated goal of the proposal, and suggests, rather speculatively, that hunters could be affected",Half True,"June 13, 2014"
"The Chamber of Commerce says new carbon regulations will kill ""244,000 jobs a year"" and cost average families ""$1,200 a year.""","The White House on June 2 unveiled tough new regulations to curb carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants.   Moments after the long-awaited announcement, many Republicans panned it as the latest escalation in President Barack Obama’s so-called ""war on coal"" and said it would kill jobs, raise electric prices and hurt the economy. Among the GOP critics was U.S. Senate candidate Ed Gillespie, who was campaigning that day  in Southwest Virginia -- the heart of coal country. Gillespie, who is hoping to unseat Democratic incumbent Mark Warner this fall, was interviewed by WCYB-TV. ""These new regulations on carbon emissions will kill, according to the Chamber of Commerce, 244,000 jobs a year, every year, for the next 15 years and will cost the average family of four $1,200 a year on higher energy costs,"" he said. Gillespie was referring to a U.S. Chamber of Commerce study that was released May 28 and became the basis for much of the GOP criticism of Obama’s carbon-reduction plan. The national goal of the regulations is to cut carbon emission from existing power plants by 30 percent by 2030 -- compared to 2005 levels. This is to be achieved in part by creating carbon caps for each state and providing options for them to reach their targets, including regional ""cap and trade"" networks, investing in renewable energy and smart grid technology, and eventually phasing out many coal plants. But the chamber study that Gillespie and other Republicans cite assumed that the Obama administration would want to decrease carbon emissions by 42 percent — not 30 percent — before 2030. That’s a significant difference when it comes to the pace for reducing CO2 levels, a point that the chamber acknowledges.   ""We were never saying those were the numbers for any scenario other than the ones that we put forward,"" Matt Letourneau, spokesman for the Institute for 21st Century Energy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told PolitiFact National.  ""Now that we have a different benchmark, we’re taking a look at the rule and the analysis and the model and we’ll see what we can do (to update the study)."" Why can’t the numbers simply be converted? In assuming Obama would set a higher goal, the chamber also postulated that the Environmental Protection Agency would be forced to change other policies to meet the 42 percent threshold. The goal would be attainable, the chamber concluded, only if the EPA by 2022 required new natural gas plants to use carbon capture and storage technology.  The actual proposal, however, does not require plants to have such capabilities. This is important because, as the chamber report noted, plants with carbon capture technology are far more expensive to build and operate than traditional ones.Therefore, the chamber’s conclusion that power companies face $478 billion in compliance costs — $339 billion from construction — is likely overblown. The chamber report said power companies would significantly increase their electricity rates to recoup the costs of building new plants with carbon capture technology. Businesses would recoup their increased energy expenses, the report said, by paring jobs. The EPA was highly critical of the chamber’s report and on the day of its release, blogged that the study was ""irresponsible speculation based on guesses of what our draft proposal will be."" It noted that the chamber failed to consider significant health and climate savings that would come from lowering carbon emissions. And the EPA tipped its hand, five days prior to Gillespie’s TV interview, by announcing its soon-to-be-revealed regulations would not require carbon capture. We also should note that Gillespie, in his TV interview, overstated two figures in the flawed  report: He said an average family would spend $1,200 a year more on electricity; the actual figure was about $200. We asked Gillespie’s campaign for an explanation and spokesman Paul Logan said the $1,200 figure actually came from an analysis by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group. Heritage’s estimate, released in March, incorrectly assumed that the EPA would phase out all coal-fired energy plants. Gillespie said the chamber predicted an annual loss of 244,000 jobs; the actual number was 224,000. In addition to his TV interview, Gillespie posted a tweet that applied estimates in the chamber report to the administration’s proposal. Paul Logan, a spokesman for Gillespie, said defended his boss’s comments by saying the chamber study ""looked at a similar regulatory scheme"" to what Obama proposed. As we noted, Gillespie was hardly the only Republican who used chamber statistics to denounce the White House proposal. Similar comments were made by U.S. Rep. Randy Forbes, R-4th; Pat Mullins, chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia; and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. The National Republican Senatorial Committee is using the statistics in a robocall attack against incumbent Warner, whom Gillespie is challenging. Our ruling Gillespie, during a visit to coal country, said new EPA ""regulations on carbon emissions will kill, according to the Chamber of Commerce, 244,000 jobs a year, every year, for the next 15 years and will cost the average family of four $1,200 a year on higher energy costs."" Gillespie refers to a May 28 chamber study that wrongly assumed the White House would set a benchmark of reducing carbon emissions by 42 percent before 2030 -- a standard that the report said could only met by requiring the construction of natural gas plants with expensive carbon capture capabilities. The regulations, released June 2, actually put forward a 30 percent reduction within that timeframe. The chamber says its estimates do not apply to the goals as announced. There was opportunity for Gillespie to realize the chamber’s assumptions were unreliable. Five days before his comments, the EPA announced that carbon capture would not be part of its upcoming proposals. Gillespie not only continued to use numbers from the report, he overstated some of them",False,"June 9, 2014"
"New carbon regulations will increase electric bills by ""$17 billion every year"" and ""potentially put an average of 224,000 more people out of work every year.""","President Barack Obama’s administration unveiled tough new regulations on existing power plants that seek to significantly curb carbon emissions in the coming decades. Moments after the proposal was released, it was widely panned by Republicans, who called it a continuation of Obama’s so-called ""War on Coal"" and said it would kill jobs, raise electric prices and hurt the economy. On his website, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, put it in more direct terms: ""The president’s plan would indeed cause a surge in electricity bills — costs stand to go up $17 billion every year.  But it would also shut down plants and potentially put an average of 224,000 more people out of work every year."" The details of Obama’s plan are extensive — the proposal is 645 pages long. So how did Republicans come up with such exact (and damning) figures so quickly after the proposal was released? The estimates actually come from a U.S. Chamber of Commerce study that was released in late May. We took a look at it last week, and noted it made several assumptions about the June 2 proposal. We warned that the findings of the study would be relatively unusable if those predictions did not come to light. And that’s what happened. The Environmental Protection Agency announced a goal of reducing carbon emissions 30 percent (based on 2005 levels) by 2030. This is achieved in part by creating carbon caps for each state and providing options for them to reach their targets, including regional ""cap and trade"" networks, investing in renewable energy and smart grid technology, and eventually phasing out many existing coal plants. But the chamber study that Boehner and other Republicans cite assumed that the Obama administration would want to decrease carbon emissions by 42 percent — not 30 percent — before 2030 (a number Obama first suggested in 2009 during the Copenhagen international climate change talks). When it comes to the pace for reducing CO2 levels, this is a significant difference. This is a point even the chamber made to PolitiFact now that Obama’s regulations have been released. ""We were never saying those were the numbers for any scenario other than the ones that we put forward,"" said Matt Letourneau, spokesman for the Institute for 21st Century Energy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ""Now that we have a different benchmark, we’re taking a look at the rule and the analysis and the model and we’ll see what we can do (to update the study)."" Why don’t the numbers work? By assuming a much more difficult goal, the chamber also predicted that by 2022, the EPA (under a different president) will have to change course to meet the 42 percent threshold. The only means to accomplish this, the chamber concluded, was to force new natural gas plants to use carbon capture and storage technology. In September, the EPA said new natural gas plants would not need to include carbon capture in their facilities. A large chunk of the chamber’s estimated costs of the carbon rules comes from the assumption that new natural gas plants will require carbon capture technology, which they say is 50 percent more expensive to build and also more expensive to operate. Therefore, their assumption that power companies face $478 billion in compliance costs — $339 billion from construction — is likely overblown. Letourneau and Boehner’s office both noted media reports that said the 30 percent threshold could be increased before the final regulations are approved. (Of course, it could also be lowered, too.) There will be a 120-day public comment period before the EPA releases its final draft. There are other criticisms of the chamber study. For example, it did not factor in the cost of no action, which the EPA said is significant. The debate over the cost of these regulations will continue, and we do not dismiss offhand the idea that new regulations on existing power plants have an economic cost. For its part, the EPA says that the new rules will save consumers money on their electric bills and will spur economic growth that will surpass the expense. But even if the regulations do have an economic cost, it’s misleading to quote estimates from a study that wrongly assumed a key piece of the EPA’s proposal. Our ruling Boehner said the EPA’s plan to regulate carbon emissions in existing power plants will increase electric bills by ""$17 billion every year"" and ""potentially put an average of 224,000 more people out of work every year."" Those numbers are based on a U.S. Chamber of Commerce study that came out before the EPA announced the regulations on existing power plants. That study wrongly assumed the administration would set a benchmark of reducing carbon emissions by 42 percent before 2030. The regulations released June 2 actually put forward a 30 percent reduction within that timeframe. The chamber itself told PolitiFact its estimates are not based on the goals as announced.

"""Solar panels drain the sun’s energy.""","Recently, several readers -- feeling depressed after reading that a promising type of clean, renewable energy was seemingly weakening the earth’s very life force -- asked us to check a claim circulating on social media that ""solar panels drain the sun’s energy."" Rest easy, readers: The claim stems from a bit of satire being passed along by the scientifically gullible. In mid May 2014, the website National Report published an article headlined, ""Solar Panels Drain the Sun’s Energy, Experts Say."" Here’s an excerpt: ""This week, a scientific research facility in Wyoming made a startling discovery that is certain to change the way millions of Americans look at the environmentalism movement, after they found conclusive evidence that solar panels not only convert the sun’s energy into usable energy, but that they are also draining the sun of its own energy, possibly with catastrophic consequences far worse than global warming. ""Scientists at the Wyoming Institute of Technology, a privately-owned think tank located in Cheyenne, Wyoming, discovered that energy radiated from the sun isn’t merely captured in solar panels, but that energy is directly physically drawn from the sun by those panels, in a process they refer to as ‘forced photovoltaic drainage.’ ""‘Put into laymen’s terms, the solar panels capture the sun’s energy, but pull on the sun over time, forcing more energy to be released than the sun is actually producing,’ WIT claims in a scientific white paper published on Wednesday. ‘Imagine a waterfall, dumping water. But you aren’t catching the water in buckets, but rather sucking it in with a vacuum cleaner. Eventually, you’re going to suck in so much water that you drain the river above that waterfall completely.’ ""WIT is adamant that there’s no immediate danger, however. ‘Currently, solar panels are an energy niche, and do not pose a serious risk to the sun. But if we converted our grids to solar energy in a big way, with panels on domestic homes and commercial businesses, and paving our parking lots with panels, we’d start seeing very serious problems over time. If every home in the world had solar panels on their roofs, global temperatures would drop by as much as thirty degrees over twenty years, and the sun could die out within three hundred to four hundred years.’"" However, people passing along this story by email appear not to be aware that the National Report is a satire site. As we noted just a few days ago in another check of a National Report piece that went viral, the site’s tongue-in-cheek disclaimer says, in part, that ""the views expressed by writers on this site are theirs alone and are not reflective of the fine journalistic and editorial integrity of National Report."" The urban-legend investigation site Snopes.com has archived an even clearer disclaimer that has since been removed. The former disclaimer said, ""National Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways. All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news. Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental."" (Snopes also debunked the solar panels story on May 25, 2014.) We checked with a solar energy expert to make sure we weren’t missing something, and they agreed that the sun-draining claim is pure hokum. ""The sun is really big, really far away, and constantly producing mind-boggling amounts of energy through nuclear fusion. It couldn’t care less about your puny solar panel,"" said Mark Thurber, associate director of Stanford University’s Program on Energy and Sustainable Development. The closer you read the National Report item, the more obvious the satire becomes. It turns out that the Wyoming Institute of Technology only exists as a website, with an obviously fake backstory. ""WIT,"" according to the website, was originally founded in 1943 as the Wyoming Institute of Education and Nuclear Energy Research (WIENER, get it?) and has purportedly invented such technologies as ""smellovision,"" the ""space toilet,"" the world’s first computer virus, ""the world’s first 100% organic artificial nose, which was created for pop-star Michael Jackson in 1999,"" and the ""E-condom.""

"Surface temperatures on Earth ""have stabilized.""","Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has been attracting a lot of attention recently for expressing skepticism about how much humans contribute to global warming and what policy approaches the United States should take. During a May 20, 2014, interview, Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly asked Rubio, ""Now, you said (a) flat-out bold and fresh statement that you don't believe the scientists on global warming. Are you going up against these people?"" Rubio responded, ""No, here's the point. First of all, I have never denied the climate is changing. That shouldn't surprise us. The climate is always changing. The second point on the science is, the left loves to go around saying there is a consensus, there is a consensus. There is a majority of scientists that say that global carbon emissions by humans causes some changes in the climate. What there is no consensus on and (what) they conveniently ignore is there is no consensus on the sensitivity of the climate. How much is it changing and how much of it is directly attributable to human carbon emission? There is no consensus on that, which is why the models vary so greatly, which is why, despite 17 years of dramatic increases in carbon production by humans, surface temperatures (on) the earth have stabilized."" We wondered whether Rubio was accurate when he said that surface temperatures on Earth ""have stabilized."" Rubio’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this story. But in interviews with nearly a dozen scientists, we received a nuanced assessment of his remark. On the one hand, we found most accepting Rubio’s starting point -- that surface temperatures on earth, which were once rising rapidly, have ""paused"" their increase over the past 16 or 17 years. On the other hand, most of the scientists we checked with took exception to his use of the word ""stabilized"" to describe this phenomenon, saying the ""pause"" is temporary. While ""stabilized"" suggests that we have gotten through the worst of it, the reality, scientists say, is that temperatures will rise again, sooner or later. ""Stabilized"" is ""a very poor word to use,"" said John Reilly, co-director of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Rubio’s word choice ""has no merit,"" agreed Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center and a professor of geography at the University of Colorado-Boulder. Reto Ruedy, a climate specialist at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, concurred, saying that the claim of stabilization had ""no legitimacy."" Even Paul C. ""Chip"" Knappenberger, a scholar at the Cato Institute, said Rubio had gone too far by saying the situation had ""stabilized."" While global warming ""certainly has slowed down considerably"" over the past 16 or 17 years, Knappenberger said confirmation that the situation has ""stabilized"" would take ""another 10 to 20 years."" ""The pace will probably pick back up again at sometime in the future,"" Knappenberger said. ""But when that will be, or what the new pace will be, are far from scientifically agreed upon characteristics."" A closer look at the recent past Climate-change skeptics have made the pause a cornerstone of their argument that concern about global warming is overblown. And at least on the existence of a pause, the statistics are on their side. An interactive chart from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows land and ocean surface temperatures going back to the 1800s. While there’s been some variation in surface temperatures since 1998, it has remained within a relatively narrow band, which contrasts with the rapid rise during the decades that preceded it. (The strongest evidence of a pause is for the past 16 years, but we won’t quibble with Rubio’s use of the 17-year time frame.) Scientists also said that Rubio is correct to point to the uncertainty inherent in climate models. Mainstream climate scientists are taking the pause seriously. As PolitiFact Rhode Island has noted, the United Kingdom’s weather office has begun referring to the last 16 years as ""the recent pause in warming."" It’s worth noting that even at the level of the ""pause,"" temperatures are still historically high. As we’ve previously noted, 13 of the warmest years have occurred in the past 15 years, according to NASA. But importantly, most scientists do not expect the pause to continue indefinitely. The United Kingdom office published three reports in which they asserted that temperatures will likely resume their rapid rise soon, though on an uncertain timetable. Judith Curry, who chairs the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology -- and who believes climate change is happening but has put more emphasis on the scientific uncertainties than other scientists -- said reasonable people can disagree with how quickly the temperature rise will begin and how far it will go. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international body that has been among the most prominent voices raising the specter of significant impacts from climate change, said it ""expects the temperatures to resume increasing soon, whereas certain scientists, including myself, expect the current pause in surface temperatures to continue for another decade or two,"" Curry said. We couldn’t find any experts who believe temperatures have ""stabilized"" in the sense of settling down into a consistent pattern indefinitely. ""Increases in Earth's temperature have indeed slowed, but have certainly not stabilized,"" said Rob Jackson, an earth sciences professor at Stanford University. ""Every year is now what would have been a record year in the 1990s, and the last decade was the warmest in the modern record."" Rubio’s statement ""is misleading, because it implies that the climate has reached a balance or equilibrium, so that global temperatures will not rise in the future,"" agreed Brian Soden, a professor of meteorology and physical oceanography at the University of Miami. ""However, the earth's climate has not stabilized. In particular, the flow of energy into and out of the planet is not in balance. It is gaining more energy than it is losing, due to increased greenhouse gases, and therefore future warming is unavoidable."" Explaining the paradox of the 'pause' The central paradox Rubio points out -- an increase in carbon dioxide emissions without a commensurate rise in surface temperatures -- has prompted several theories to explain it. One reason is that, over the long term, data always fluctuates somewhat. ""The global average air temperature over the past 150 years has been characterized by overall rise,"" but superimposed on this general trend are ""periods, lasting as much as several decades, of stronger warming, little change and even cooling,"" said Serreze of the University of Colorado-Boulder. Barring dramatic cuts in carbon emissions, Serreze suggested that 50 years from now, ""the period of slower warming from the late 1990s to present will appear as just another blip on the overall pattern of warming."" Some experts add that starting the count in 1998 exaggerates the ""pause,"" since that was an unusually strong ""El Nino"" year. El Nino is an occasional pattern in ocean currents that significantly affects the weather globally, including raising global temperatures by releasing ""tremendous amounts of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere,"" said Jennifer Francis, a research professor at the Institute of Marine and Coastal Sciences at Rutgers University. ""To look at the trend of a relatively short period that started out with an extraordinary El Nino event causing a huge temperature spike is a cheap device,"" said Reto Ruedy of NASA’s Goddard Institute. The physical explanation gaining the most traction is that ""the oceans have accumulated most of the heat from human-induced global warming,"" said Harold Wanless, University of Miami geological sciences professor. One recent paper found that in one part of the Pacific, middle-depth temperatures have been rising 15 times faster over the past six decades than at any other time over the past 10,000 years. Other papers have found similar evidence. Basic physics teaches that water has an immense ability to take in and hold heat -- but that same heat will eventually be released. ""The trapped heat is still in the system, and it will be released into the atmosphere when the recent pattern of Pacific Ocean temperatures switches back to its warmer phase,"" said Francis of Rutgers. Other factors may also be playing a role in the ""pause,"" said Reilly of MIT. In addition to an absence of strong El Nino events since 1998, Reilly said, the eruption of some moderate volcanoes may have produced cooling effects that counteracted some of the heating. And there’s evidence that the long-term data sets for temperature have under-recorded Arctic regions where temperatures have been rising most rapidly. ""So, several factors that are known sources of variability in the climate system all, by coincidence, contributed to a cooling trend over the period,"" Reilly said. This suggests that global warming ""was occurring -- it's just that the added warmth was going into the ocean.  It’s unlikely that all of these coincidences will continue, or continue to offset warming."" Our ruling Rubio said that ""surface temperatures in the earth have stabilized."" He has a point that over roughly the past decade and a half, global surface temperatures have ""paused,"" particularly compared to their rapid rise in previous decades. But scientists we interviewed agreed that the use of the word ""stabilized"" represents an unjustified leap from the data, since ""stabilized"" suggests that we have gotten through the worst of climate change. At the very least, the uncertainty inherent in climate forecasting makes such a claim of ""stabilization"" premature. More likely, the evidence suggests that the ""pause"" in global surface temperatures is temporary, with temperatures poised to rise once the oceans start releasing more heat, such as during an El Nino event. It’s not clear when temperatures will rise again, but few scientists doubt that temperatures will rise again at some point",Mostly False,"May 27, 2014"
"Since 2000, Texas has reduced ""harmful pollutants in the air like nitrogen oxide by 62.5 percent, and ozone by 23 percent--a reduction that is 12 percent greater than the national average.""","Gov. Rick Perry visited a familiar boast about the clearing skies of Texas in a May 19, 2014, letter to President Barack Obama that may have tested possible themes of another gubernatorial run for president. Saying Texas employs an ""all-of-the-above energy strategy"" tapping fossil fuels plus solar, biofuel and wind resources, Perry wrote: ""Even as our population has grown by more than 5 million since 2000, we've led the U.S. energy revolution while protecting our environment and reducing harmful pollutants in the air like nitrogen oxide by 62.5 percent, and ozone by 23 percent — a reduction that is 12 percent greater than the national average."" 62, 23, 12 — sounds like a quarterback’s call before the snap. We were curious about his numbers. Is Perry right about the pollution reductions as well as the cuts outpacing decreases nationally? A 2010 fact check Perry made a similar claim in June 2010, saying in a press release the ""Texas clean air program (has) achieved a 22 percent reduction in ozone and a 46 percent decrease in NOx (nitrogen oxide) emissions."" He’d earlier cited the same statistic in a letter to Obama. Half True, we found then. Perry accurately recapped improvements in ozone levels. But as for the NOx emissions contributing to ozone levels, his statistic included only one NOx source — industrial — which he did not note. Notably, nearly three-quarters of NOx emissions come from other sources. Also, whether state government merited credit for the improvements struck us as worthy of pause. Even if the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality was responsible for the drop in industrial NOx emissions, federal efforts  — in particular, vehicle emission regulations  — were a key factor. Significantly, too, the state's ozone-related programs existed to help Texas comply with federal expectations. As noted then, a goal of the federal Clean Air Act is to reduce the levels of what the Environmental Protection Agency calls ""commonly found air pollutants."" Among those is ground-level ozone, which forms when nitrogen oxide emissions mix with volatile organic compounds in sunlight and heat. Common sources of nitrogen oxides: cars and trucks, power plants and industrial boilers. EPA sets limits on the concentration of ozone, the primary component of smog, in the air. Areas that fail to meet the standard are designated in ""nonattainment."" Under the Clean Air Act, the state is required to submit plans to EPA that outline how it will clean up areas and meet the federal standard. Figures hold up As in 2010, we asked David T. Allen, a University of Texas professor of chemical engineering, about Perry’s statement. By email, Allen noted that per figures posted online by the TCEQ, Perry’s analysis holds up. Allen also pointed out an EPA web page indicating that nationally ozone levels in 2012 were down 9 percent compared to 2000 with NOx levels down 29 to 50 percent, depending on the measurement applied. Separately by email, commission spokesman Terry Clawson sent us a spreadsheet he described as the basis of the charts. Clawson said the data came from the EPA. Let’s recap the charted changes in ozone, then NOx. Ozone down 23 percent According to a commission chart on a web page last updated April 17, 2014, ozone in Texas decreased 23 percent from 2000 through 2012, as Perry said. (The comparisons reflect what officials call ""fourth-high"" ozone readings. Clawson emailed us this technical explanation.) A headline on the chart says the ozone decrease for the other 49 states averaged 11 percent. Texas ran 12 percentage points ahead of that. The chart shows ozone decreasing in all but a few states--Wyoming, Utah, Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Hawaii and Alaska--with the drop in Texas bested only by Tennessee, California and Georgia.  Source: Web page, ""Air Quality Successes - Criteria Pollutants,"" Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, last updated April 17, 2014 (accessed May 21, 2014) NOx from industrial sources down 62.5 percent In the period, Allen emailed, industrial emissions of NOx (not including motor vehicles) in Texas dropped 62.5 percent. He pointed out a commission chart indicating that industrial NOx emissions of more than 300,000 xx tons in 2011 compared to a shade less than 800,000 xx tons per year in 2000, which works out to a 62.5 percent reduction, as Perry said.  Source: Web page, ""Air Quality Successes - Emissions Inventory,"" Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, last updated April 17, 2014 (accessed May 21, 2014) Sierra Club stresses  federal role For another perspective, we turned to Neil Carman of the Lone Star chapter of the Sierra Club. By phone, Carman called Perry’s figures accurate though he suggested the cited reductions occurred mainly thanks to federal laws and enforcement. Carman, director of the club’s Clean Air program, said the federal government still considers the multi-county Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth areas as not attaining minimum ozone standards. He pointed out a Sierra Club press release stating the club on May 20, 2014, filed suit against the EPA for failing to classify Dallas-Fort Worth as having a ""severe"" ozone problem, an action that would have required polluters to clean the air, the press release says. By email, Carman said the governor's claim misleads by ""lumping together Texas' ozone woes in Houston and"" Dallas-Fort Worth ""with all the other ozone areas in the nation, including areas that have minimal or no problems."" A ""comparison to other states with few ozone problems is roughly analogous to comparing a driver who gets 30 speeding tickets a year and reduces it by 50% over ten years to 15 per year,"" Carman said, ""while a second driver only had 3 tickets and reduces it by 33% to 2 tickets per year. The first driver had the greatest (percentage) reduction at 50% and the greatest volume reduction but also had the worst speeding record."" Earlier, Clawson indicated the gains noted by Perry weren’t entirely due to federal oversight. By email,  he noted a 1999 Texas law that required power plants to reduce NOx emissions, also saying other state laws enacted since 2000 stressed energy efficiency, reductions in pollution and renewable energy sources like wind power. Clawson, asked about the bulk of NOx pollution coming from vehicles and non-industrial sources, which Perry’s statement did not take up, said NOx emissions from non-industrial sources in Texas in 2011 were 42 percent less than what such sources emitted in 1999. Our ruling Perry said that since 2000, Texas has reduced ""harmful pollutants in the air like nitrogen oxide by 62.5 percent, and ozone by 23 percent — a reduction that is 12 percent greater than the national average."" Those figures are accurate, but the claim (like Perry’s 2010 statement) takes into account only one NOx source — industrial — which it failed to note. Nearly three-quarters of NOx emissions come from other sources. Perry’s declaration also didn't reflect on federal laws and oversight that figure into pollution reductions. Texas didn’t make the gains in isolation",Half True,"May 26, 2014"
"Cap and trade legislation ""was originally a Republican idea.""","U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a GOP presidential contender, made waves about climate change in a May 11 interview with ABC’s Jonathan Karl on This Week. ""I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it,"" Rubio said. ""And I do not believe that the laws that they propose we pass will do anything about it. Except it will destroy our economy."" One of Florida’s other nationally watched politicians -- Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz -- criticized her fellow Floridian’s stance. After a May 13 speech at Daemen College in upstate New York, an audience member asked her how to get ""Congress unstuck in stomping on science."" Wasserman Schultz suggested that voters stop electing tea party-aligned politicians -- and then she turned her sights on Rubio for disagreeing with the scientific consensus that climate change is man-made. Wasserman Schultz, who represents parts of Broward and Miami-Dade counties, said rising sea levels and flooding will make part of her district uninhabitable in the future. She called for politicians to reach across the aisle in search of solutions, singling out a cap and trade plan as an area where the parties could agree. ""That was originally a Republican idea. It was developed in the 1970s when the Clean Air Act was initially adopted."" We decided to check Wasserman Schultz’s claim that cap and trade was originally a Republican idea. Cap and trade The idea of cap and trade is that the government sets a limit (the cap) on how much carbon individual companies -- typically electric utilities and manufacturers -- can emit. The government then issues permits to companies and allows them to buy and sell the permits as needed (the trade). If the policy works as planned, overall emissions decline, companies determine for themselves the best way to lower emissions, and the free market rewards those who lower emissions most effectively. Wasserman Schultz started the clock ticking in the 1970s. Her spokesman, Sean Bartlett, told PolitiFact Florida that ""the 1977 Clean Air Act amendments were the first time federal law used the concept of offset mechanisms that ultimately became the ‘cap and trade’ systems."" That law included precursor ideas, such as providing industry with flexibility to meet limits, rather than simply imposing controlling regulations, said Eric Pooley, a spokesman for the Environmental Defense Fund and author of The Climate War: True Believers, Power Brokers, and the Fight to Save the Earth. In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan used a cap and trade system to phase out leaded gasoline, noted MIT economics professor Richard Schmalensee and Harvard Kennedy School government professor Robert Stavins. In 1989, President George H. W. Bush proposed the use of a cap and trade system to cut by half sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants and consequent acid rain, they wrote in a Boston Globe op-ed in 2010. ""An initially resistant Democratic Congress overwhelmingly endorsed the proposal,"" the professors wrote. ""The landmark Clean Air Act amendments of 1990 passed the Senate 89 to 10 and the House 401 to 25."" Bush not only accepted the cap, but he sided with environmentalists who wanted a larger cut than his own advisers, according to Smithsonian Magazine, in a report that detailed how the Environmental Defense Fund worked with Bush’s White House to make cap and trade a reality. ""George H. W. Bush does indeed deserve enormous credit for being the champion of the cap and trade program for sulfur dioxide, a major cause of acid rain,"" Pooley said. ""That has led many over the years to refer to it as a Republican idea."" But Pooley said that Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -- a Democrat -- also deserves credit for leading the legislative charge that ultimately passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority. ""So if pressed, I would call it a bipartisan idea that was championed by a Republican president,"" he told PolitiFact Florida. In 2005, the EPA under President George W. Bush issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule, which aimed to achieve ""the largest reduction in air pollution in more than a decade"" using cap and trade, wrote Stavins and Schmalensee. They noted the contributions under Reagan and both Bushes to argue that cap and trade should be embraced by Republicans as well as Democrats. ""After all, these policies were innovations developed by conservatives in the Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush administrations (and once strongly condemned by liberals),"" they wrote. In 2003, McCain, an Arizona Republican, and Sen. Joe Lieberman, then a Democrat from Connecticut, introduced the ""Climate Stewardship Act,"" which would have used a similar cap and trade approach to reduce carbon pollution linked to global warming. Versions of the bill were reintroduced in 2005 and 2007. That was the first time legislation was introduced to use cap and trade for carbon emissions, Pooley told PolitiFact. ""The enormous economic costs of damage caused by air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions to the environment and human health are not factored into the price of power produced by fossil-fueled technologies,"" McCain said in a floor speech to mark the bill’s 2007 introduction. ""Yet, it’s a cost that we all bear, too often in terms of ill-health and diminished quality of life."" McCain’s 2007 version was co-sponsored by Illinois Democratic Sen. Barack Obama. And both McCain and Obama had cap and trade programs in their presidential platforms. In June 2009, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives passed a cap and trade bill, by a razor-thin margin, 219-212. But the bill failed to survive in the Senate amid Republican opposition. In 2011, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives has taken a firm stand against a cap and trade bill. ""A full-blown fleecing of the middle class, it would raise electricity prices, increase gasoline prices, and ship American jobs to countries like China and India,"" wrote John Boehner, now the Speaker of the House, about the bill in June 2010. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said that cap and trade legislation ""was originally a Republican idea."" Experts who have followed the history of the environmental policy focus on the fact that emissions trading to address acid rain became part of the Clean Air Act of 1990 under Bush. The legislation ultimately passed with bipartisan support under a Republican president. More recently, another prominent Republican -- McCain -- co-sponsored cap and trade legislation. Democrats did support cap and trade legislations at different points along the way. But we found a strong tradition of support from Republican presidents for cap and trade, which uses markets to try to reduce pollution",Mostly True,"May 23, 2014"
"Human activity is not ""causing these dramatic changes to our climate.""","Scientists have been issuing more new reports on the irreversible effects of climate change in recent weeks. Two groups reported on May 12, 2014, that the global sea level will rise at least 10 feet, accelerating to a dangerous pace after the next century. Just a day before those reports were released, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., sat down with ABC’s Jonathan Karl on This Week. Talk turned to climate change, where the possible Republican presidential candidate denied a link between humans and the changing environment. ""I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it,"" he said. ""And I do not believe that the laws that they propose we pass will do anything about it. Except it will destroy our economy."" We’ve noted before that Rubio has disputed the basic science of climate change. So when Rubio said human activity isn’t causing changes to the environment, he’s got it all wrong. In this case, Rubio framed his thoughts about climate change as his personal opinion. But the causes of global warming are backed up by thorough research, so we didn’t see room for debate in Rubio’s claim. Rubio’s said before, ""I’m not a scientist, man."" So PolitiFact reached out to scientists who could explain the facts behind climate change. We've rated similar claims False from Tim Pawlenty and Rick Perry, but we'll rate it again because it's a persistent claim we see year after year. Rubio’s staff didn’t return our request for comment. How our climate is changing Historically, the earth goes through periods of hotter and cooler temperatures. So how do we know global warming isn’t a natural part of this cycle? By taking measurements, said Leonard Berry, director of Florida Atlantic University’s Center for Environmental Studies. ""We can measure the fact that the earth is warming. We can measure the fact that the ocean is warming,"" Berry said. ""While geological history shows warming and cooling periods, as far back as we go, none shows the kind of warming and the kind of changes we’re experiencing right now."" Scientists trace back this shift to the Industrial Revolution, which began in 1760. Since that period, carbon dioxide rose 40 percent and methane by 150 percent. High levels of these and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap heat at the surface of the earth, warming the planet. By burning fossil fuels, chopping down trees, and using fertilizer, humans have directly contributed to global warming. The connection between increased levels of greenhouse gases and rising temperature has been confirmed by scientists for over a century, said Jennifer Francis, a Rutgers University marine and coastal sciences professor. ""There is as much uncertainty about this connection as there is about what will happen when you drop an object,"" Francis said. ""It will fall."" The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is also on board with human activity as a cause. They reported that were it not for human impact, the likely effect of natural changes to the environment would’ve been one of cooling, not warming. They cite ""very high confidence"" that human activities caused a change of course. The U.S. Global Change Research program published a 2014 report on climate change. It doesn’t debate whether human activity causes climate change. Rather, it focuses on what actions to take to lessen its effects. A May 2013 report analyzing all scientific papers that address the causes of climate change showed 97.1 percent of findings that took a position agree that there’s been a negative human impact on the atmosphere. Comedian John Oliver cleverly addressed the debate’s conclusiveness on a recent Last Week Tonight episode by arranging a representative debate between 97 climate change scientists and three deniers. As a politician from Florida, Rubio must contend with research that pegs Miami and Tampa as two of the U.S. cities most likely to be impacted by climate change. Rising sea levels will make them more prone to flooding. ""Whatever the cause of climate change, the impacts on Florida are already important and that it would be difficult for responsible people in Florida to ignore that fact,"" Berry said. Our ruling Rubio said human activity is not ""causing these dramatic changes to our climate."" An overwhelming majority of scientists agree that humans, by burning fossil fuels, contribute directly to global warming. Not only is Rubio incorrect, but he’s ignoring a mountain of concrete, scientific research",False,"May 13, 2014"
"Americans ""bought into climate change"" in 2004-06, but then most ""began wandering away from this issue.""","As Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio edges closer to a 2016 presidential bid, he wants Republican primary voters to know where he stands on litmus test issues like climate change. ""I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate,"" Rubio said on ABC's This Week. ""I do not believe that the laws that they propose we pass will do anything about it, except it will destroy our economy."" Many Republican voters would nod in agreement, but the question is, how well does this view sit with the public at large? Joe Scarborough, host of MSNBC’s Morning Joe, said Rubio might be on relatively safe ground with the public. ""From 2004, 2005, 2006, Americans were bought in to the concept of climate change and that we need to move aggressively on it,"" Scarborough said. But since then, the public shifted, he said. ""Check the polling: Most Americans began wandering away from this issue,"" Scarborough said. From Scarborough’s lips to our ears. In this fact-check, we review the polls on climate change and global warming (terms that are used interchangeably) to see if Americans care less than they did half a dozen years ago. Pollsters get at this question in a few ways. We’ll look at each one. Is it happening? For nearly 15 years, the Gallup organization has been asking people if they think global warming is underway. In 2002, 71 percent of the public said it is happening or will happen in their lifetime. That percentage peaked at 75 percent in 2008 and then fell. It reached a low of 62 percent in 2011 and since then has risen slightly. As of March 2014, it stood at 65 percent. With a margin of error of 4 percent, the result is modestly less than what Gallup reported in 2002. We find similar but slightly larger swings of opinion in the Pew Research Center data, although the Pew survey only goes back to 2006. Pew asks if people see solid evidence that the earth is warming. In 2006, 77 percent said yes. That fell to 57 percent in 2009, then rose to 67 percent in 2013. The trends don't exactly match the pattern Scarborough described. He suggested a simple slide down. In reality, there’s more of an up-down-up. Still, the public seems a little less certain about climate change today than in the mid 2000s. Is it something you worry about? Even if you believe the climate is changing, it might not cause you great concern. A group of university researchers from Drexel, McGill and Ohio State blended the results from a number of surveys to derive what they called the Climate Change Threat Index. Basically, the index captures whether people take the issue seriously. Robert Brulle, a sociologist at Drexel University, is part of the team. From 2002 to 2005, the value of the index fluctuated between 40 and 45. (These are abstract units and should not be confused with the percentage of people who care.) Then it gained about 10 points. ""The big shift started in 2006 and coincided with the release of Al Gore’s movie  An Inconvenient Truth,"" Brulle said. ""It dropped off in the fall of 2008 after the big recession and the Wall Street meltdown."" Today, the index is about where is was in 2004. Again, up-down-up. Interestingly, Brulle and his colleagues Jason Carmichael and J. Craig Jenkins found that two factors primarily drive public concern about climate change. First, people worry more about it so long as more pressing problems like the economy don’t loom larger. Second, Republicans effectively can dial concern up or down. The partisan split on this issue shows up in every survey. The more Republican the voter, the less likely they are to say climate change is real or that it will make a difference. When Republican leaders are more vocal in their rejection of climate change (such as voting against a particular bill), public concern falls, at least among Republican leaning voters. When those leaders treat it more seriously, concern rises. But do you worry about it a lot? Gallup gets at the level of concern by asking people if they think global warming will pose a serious threat to them or their way of life in their lifetime. In 2004, about 34 percent answered yes. That rose to 40 percent in 2008, then fell to a low of 32 percent in 2010. It then rose to 38 percent and slid a bit to 36 percent where it stands today. When you account for the margin of error, public opinion has yo-yoed a bit but hasn’t changed all that much. Gallup finds that few American list climate change as a top concern. It ranked near the bottom out of 15 issues polled. Asked how much they worry, 51 percent said little or not at all about climate change, compared to just 11 percent who said they were unconcerned about the economy. Are humans causing it? In 2006, Pew found that 41 percent of public thought the Earth was getting warmer mainly due to human activity such as burning fossil fuels. In keeping with the pattern we saw for other questions, that number dropped to 34 percent in 2010, and then rose to 44 percent by the end of 2013. On this point, the partisan divide is pronounced. Just 24 percent of Republicans thought humans were driving climate change, compared to 43 percent of independents and 66 percent of Democrats. The Gallup polls show a similar pattern. In 2004, 61 percent thought humans were making the planet warmer. That fell to 50 percent in 2010, followed by a rise to 57 percent today. Again, the polling shows a slight decline in public buy-in on climate change since 2004, but it has risen from a low point a few years ago. Our ruling Scarborough said Americans have ""have wandered away"" from the issue of climate change since 2004. They certainly did, as polls consistently show dips through 2010. However, support has inched back in recent years.  While the recent gains remain below the 2004 levels, the overall drop isn't as dramatic as Scarborough makes it sound",Half True,"May 13, 2014"
"The proposed Gogebic mine in northern Wisconsin ""could be extended as long as 21 miles.""","Much of the debate over the proposed Gogebic mine in northern Wisconsin has turned on environmental and economic concerns. Less attention has been paid to the size of the project. In an opinion piece in the New York Times Sunday Review, ""The fight for Wisconsin’s soul,"" Dan Kaufman discusses the open pit iron mine that Gogebic Taconite wants to build in Iron and Ashland counties. Kaufman is a Wisconsin native, writer and musician who lives in Brooklyn N.Y. He’s also a freelance fact checker for the Times and has previously written about Wisconsin politics for the paper. ""The $1.5 billion mine would initially be close to four miles long, up to a half-mile wide and nearly 1,000 feet deep, but it could be extended as long as 21 miles,"" Kaufman wrote in the piece published March 29, 2014. That’s about the distance from Milwaukee’s Bradford Beach to, say, downtown Waukesha. We’ve considered a couple of previous statements that addressed the size of the mine. We rated True a claim by state Rep. Evan Goyke, D-Milwaukee, who said the mine would be larger than his Assembly district, which is among the smallest in the state. State Rep. Penny Bernard Schaber, D-Appleton, said the mine would be two-thirds the size of Lake Winnebago. We rated that Mostly False. So what about Kaufman’s claim that the mine could be 21 miles long? Kaufman said the estimate was based on news reports, and documents that the company filed with the state of Wisconsin. Those records show Gogebic has an option to purchase the iron found in the deposit, which is 21 miles long, threading through the the Penokee mountain range. ""You'll notice our phrase says ‘but it could be extended as long as 21 miles,’"" Kaufman said in an email. ""We don't say it will be for sure. The company has many potential phases outlined of this project."" Here’s how the Department of Natural Resources describes the proposed mine on its website: ""Gogebic is currently considering potential development along a four-mile stretch east of Mellen in west-central Ashland County."" So, what accounts for the difference? Digging in The permit process for the mine is in the early stages, said Larry Lynch, a hydrogeologist with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. He is the agency’s top administrator overseeing the project. The first stage would actually be two pits, each two miles long. That’s different from a single giant trench suggested in Kaufman’s claim. Kaufman describes a mine that if fully developed could be 21 miles long, a half mile wide and 1,000 feet deep. There’s no question this would be an immense project, if it happens. But the mine would never look like that. Lynch said the first phase involves the excavation of a pit, which would, in turn, be filled in by the next pit. (Separately, we rated Mostly True a Kaufman claim that the company would be allowed to fill in ""pristine streams and ponds with mine waste."") In any case, the mine’s first phase would operate for a projected 35 years. The mine faces strong opposition from the neighboring Bad River band of the Chippewa. And the permitting process would be repeated if the company wanted to mine any additional part of the deposit. That would depend upon what happens with the first phase, and comes with a host of unknowns. Geologists believe the deposit extends 21 miles, but Lynch said ""we do not have any information that says it will be economical"" for the company to mine all of the iron in the deposit. The iron in the latter phases might been too difficult to extract, in part because the iron is laced throughout the mountains in that region of the state. In any case, no one is suggesting the mine -- even if it was fully developed decades from now -- would be a single, 21-mile-long pit. Our rating Kaufman says the mine ""could be extended as long as 21 miles."" That’s the size of the deposit that Gogebic Taconite has the rights to mine. But the initial phase envisioned in the permitting process is a four-mile stretch. Any additional mining would require another permitting process and would be decades away. And that’s only if the company decides it’s worth the effort. Yourdictionary.com says: ""The definition of ‘could’ is often used in the place of ‘can’ to show a little doubt."" But there’s more than a little doubt here. Kaufman’s statement may be partially true, but it leaves out important information and details",Half True,"May 8, 2014"
"A 2013 state law would allow the operator of an iron ore mine in northern Wisconsin to ""fill in pristine streams and ponds with mine waste.""","Debate over the proposed Gogebic Taconite iron ore mine in far northern Wisconsin has quieted since the 2013 passage of a state law relaxing environmental protections for iron mining. But it has not disappeared. Gogebic wants to build a $1.5 billion open pit iron mine in the Penokee Range in Iron and Ashland counties, and has begun what is expected to be a long permitting process with the state Department of Natural Resources. The agency is one of several, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, that will weigh in on the project. Company officials and state business leaders say the mine will provide thousands of jobs in an economically depressed part of the state. Opposition comes from environmentalists, some local residents and members of the Bad River band of the Chippewa, whose reservation lies near the site. Opponents have dug in -- some literally in a North Woods encampment, and some in higher profile venues such as the pages of the Sunday New York Times. Environmental arguments against the project dominated a March 29, 2014 opinion piece in the Times by Wisconsin native Dan Kaufman, a writer and musician who now lives in Brooklyn N.Y. (Kaufman is also a fact checker who works as a freelancer for the Times.) Kaufman’s piece was titled ""The Fight for Wisconsin’s soul"" and detailed the size and scope of what all agree will be an immense project. (In a separate item, we rated Half True a Kaufman claim that the mine ""could be extended as long as 21 miles."") Gogebic had a hand in drafting the 2013 law, which Kaufman says would give the company  ""astonishing latitude"" when it came to building the mine -- including this startling claim: ""The new law allows the company to fill in pristine streams and ponds with mine waste."" When asked for backup, Kaufman said portions of the law, Section 295, mandate that the state approve the filling of ponds and streams, providing the company re-creates -- the legal term is mitigates -- the filled-in area in another location. ""So, an applicant shall receive DNR approval if they do something to ‘mitigate or compensate’ for the destruction elsewhere,"" Kaufman said in an email interview. But that important point was not mentioned in his original piece. In the interview, Kaufman noted the law doesn’t say where the company would have to do the mitigation work. It could, he argued, be nowhere near the mine. Kaufman’s overall interpretation of the mining law is correct, said Larry Lynch, a hydrogeologist with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. He is the agency’s top official overseeing the project. For years, state law has allowed developers who build on wetlands to re-create an equivalent wetlands in another location. The mining law applied a similar standard to some bodies of water that would be affected by the Gogebic project, Lynch said. ""You can do that under limited situations,"" he said. ""If they are going to have to impact surface waters, they can propose to mitigate."" The law applies to small lakes and streams -- lakes that are smaller than two acres and streams that have a watershed smaller than two square miles. The question of where Gogebic will store waste rock is an important aspect of the mine project. That’s because to get at the iron deposits, the company will have to dig out and remove tons of undesired material from two pits that are each estimated to be two miles long. The rock that’s embedded with the iron is then removed, crushed and the iron removed with giant magnets. Preliminary plans call for the waste rock to be piled on the surface of the ground, an enormous pile called a ""waste facility."" Lynch said the company has not told the state where on the site they propose to locate such a facility -- or said whether any bodies of water could be affected. Tentative plans call for Gogebic to use waste rock from the second pit to backfill the first pit, while the remaining rock would remain on the surface. At this point, the company has not proposed filling in any streams or ponds. ""It will depend on the design submitted at that time,"" Lynch said. ""They may lay it out so that it doesn’t have any impact on streams or lakes."" Our rating The state law aimed at paving the way for the Gogebic mine relaxed environmental regulations for iron mining, and sped up the permit process, steps aimed at giving the company more certainty. Kaufman says that law also lets the company  ""fill in pristine streams and ponds with mine waste."" Kaufman’s correct that the new mining law allows streams and ponds to be filled in at the mining site. But he left out an important point --  that before that takes place the company and state would have to strike a deal for comparable streams and ponds to be created elsewhere",Mostly True,"May 8, 2014"
"""A lot of the problems with forest fires ... is because of bad policy (not to clear out the forests) that was put in place by environmentalists.""","America gets a lot of wildfires. Some of them hit grassy rangelands, some hit forests, most are small but some are huge. The 2011 Wallow forest fire in Arizona destroyed over half a million acres. Since 2000, the country has averaged nearly 75,000 fires a year with over 80 million acres lost. There are many causes but Dana Perino, former press secretary to President George W. Bush, focused on just one. Last week on Fox News’ The Five, the conversation turned to climate change and in the middle of making the case that economic growth had to be part of any solution, Perino made a passing reference to fires. ""A lot of the problems with forest fires, the major raging ones that happen in the West,"" Perino said, ""Is because of bad policy that was put in place by environmentalists and not clear out the forests."" We tried to reach Perino to ask her what she meant by ""a lot"" and what policies she had in mind. We did not hear from her. In this fact-check, we dig into the rich debate over the role of environmentalists and wildfires. In particular, we aim to see if fire damage would have been substantially less if environmental  policies were different. This question is as vast as the nearly 200 million acres managed by U.S. Forest Service, but we found that extensive drought and vast amounts of combustible material played a key role. And what about governments failing to proactively clear out forests? The consensus suggests a mix of factors that include fire policies dating back to the early 1900s and limited budgets to reduce fire hazards. What’s less clear is the role of environmental activists and environmental policies. It is true that environmental regulations and legal challenges by environmental activists frequently delay the work of the Forest Service.  It is difficult to say if these delays played a major role in the large fires the country has experienced. Let’s take a look at the big picture, starting with the role of environmentalists. The environmental factor To John Barnwell, director of policy for the Society of American Foresters, a professional education group, the lack of money to prevent fires is primary. But environmentalists and their actions play a role. Barnwell chafes at the long environmental review process and frequent litigation over Environmental Impact Statements that beset the Forest Service. A 2010 analysis from Western Michigan University found that no other agency tops the Forest Service for the number of suits under the National Environmental Policy Act. It averaged about 100 legal challenges each year. In some well-known cases (think of the Spotted Owl in the Pacific Northwest), logging ground to a halt entirely due to environmental protection rules under the Endangered Species Act. Timber harvests on federal land are a fraction of what they were in late 1970s. Ann Camp, a forestry scientist at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, says national environmental groups seem to be intractable to compromise. ""I can tell you from experience that local environmentalists and local chapters of national environmental organizations have been on board for some activities,"" Camp said. ""But the national chapters nixed their involvement and had already decided to contest the outcome -- whatever it was if it included any level of harvesting."" We found the case of a New Mexico fire where a Forest Service thinning project that might have reduced the damage was delayed by appeals from two environmental groups.  On the other hand, we also found examples where environmental groups worked hand in hand with loggers and state and national officials to move many projects forward. And Camp noted that some large fires took place in remote areas where no logging of any sort had ever been planned. Plus, fires have struck in forests where extensive harvests took place. There is no question that environmental rules and lawsuits delay and sometimes block activities on federal lands, but it is difficult to prove that absent those moves that the western states would have avoided their mega fires. And there are several other factors that play a more prominent role, experts say. The paradox of too little fire When Congress wants an impartial analysis, it turns to its in-house think tank, the Congressional Research Service. In 2012, the CRS looked at the causes of wildfire damage. That report said the roots of recent mega fires are ""excess biomass in the forests, due to past logging and grazing and a century of fire suppression, combined with an expanding wildland-urban interface — more people and houses in and near the forests — and climate change, exacerbating drought and insect and disease problems.""  A huge part of the reason we see huge fires today, the CRS report and experts say, is that we were too quick to put out fires. Around 1910 a series of massive fires wiped out entire towns. In two days, Washington, Montana, and Idaho lost 3 million acres of woodland. The fires led to a cry for the federal government to beef up its efforts to put fires out as quickly as possible. ""Our forestry tradition comes from central Europe, which has always had a paradigm that fire was bad for forests,"" Camp said. Historically, periodic fires cleared out the undergrowth while allowing mature, healthy trees to survive. But with the focus on keeping fires small (the mantra was to put out every fire by 10 a.m. the day after it was reported), the amount of combustible material grew. The growth of grazing livestock also reduced naturally occurring fires by creating gaps in the terrain that stopped a fire from spreading. The result: In the 1800s, a natural stand of Ponderosa Pine, a common species in the West, might have a few dozen trees per acre. Today, hundreds of smaller trees might be squeezed into the same area. When fire hits, it burns hotter and moves faster. Instead of running along the ground, it jumps into the crown of the trees where the winds drive it even more. Many millions of acres of forest face this risk. It wasn’t until the 1970s that Forest Service policy began to shift in earnest toward viewing fire as a potential ally in managing the forests. But today, the Forest Service describes this legacy as the equivalent of a toxic dump. A hazard that built up over decades remains in place and is potentially lethal. Too little water The new millennium opened with an extended drought that left much of the western United States primed for fire. Peter Brown, a researcher at Colorado State University, has studied the fingerprints of fires over the centuries in the growth rings of trees. ""Fire is driven by climate,"" Brown said. ""The first thing you need, besides something like a lightning strike for ignition, is dry conditions."" The years from 2000 to 2004 were spectacularly dry. Colorado State researchers said the drought was the strongest in 800 years. It killed trees, made the ones that lived more vulnerable to insects and turned the ground cover into tinder. The 2011 Wallow fire in Arizona came after a winter with little precipitation. The combination of dry ground, dry wood and grasses and strong winds produced a fire that in five weeks burned as many acres as had burned in the previous 25 years. Too little money, too much land The federal government has tried to come to terms with the legacy of a management policy that left too much fuel in the forests. Just as the nation was entering one its worst periods of fire, the Forest Service laid out an ambitious plan to clear away that excess scrub, brush and small trees. Called the 2000 Cohesive Strategy, it aimed to use controlled burns and physical removal to treat 6.9 million acres per year. An assessment by Northern Arizona University’s Ecological Restoration Institute highlighted the gap between that goal and the reality. In 2011, the agency planned to reduce the risk of fire in an additional 960,000 acres. ""Th­e number of acres treated in Fiscal Year 2011 is not even close to number of acres proposed per year in the 2000 Cohesive Strategy, or that are needed to reduce the threat of catastrophic fire at the landscape scale,"" the assessment said. At the heart of this problem is money. Barnwell said the Forest Service has been so busy fighting fires, it has needed to use the money that had been budgeted to prevent them. ""Over the past 10 years, they borrowed $3.4 billion from other activities to pay for fire suppression,"" Barnwell said. ""Congress will put some of that back, but they’ve missed a season to do really important work. They can never get ahead."" We found wide agreement that these fire prevention projects need to take place on a very large scale if they are to tamp down on the mega fires. The Congressional Research Service advised that the odds make it unlikely that the land you clear will be the one where a fire will take hold -- there are just too many acres to cover. By the CRS’ count, the odds that any given acre will catch fire are no more than 1 out of 100. Thus, you have to treat a lot of acres and that has not happened. Lastly, Perino broadly faulted policies ""put in place by environmentalists."" But both the National Environmental Policy Act (1969) and the Endangered Species Act (1973) passed either unanimously or with overwhelming bipartisan support. President Ronald Reagan signed significant revisions into law. Perino’s characterization seems like an oversimplification. Our ruling Perino said, ""A lot of the problems with forest fires is because of bad policy that was put in place by environmentalists."" The crux of this fact-check really comes down to how you define ""a lot."" While the record shows that the need for environmental impact statements and legal challenges have a significant impact on Forest Service projects on federal lands, the connection to the extreme fires of the past 15 years is less certain. Where we found broad consensus is that decades of aggressively putting out every fire as quickly as possible, and the use of land for grazing, created circumstances where the forests are brimming with fuel. That in conjunction with extended dry periods have turned them into tinderboxes. The federal strategy to remove that fuel runs up against budget constraints. The limited money is a much greater constraint than environmental policies. In the end, experts acknowledge that environmental policies are an issue, but they generally tip the scale toward other factors when assigning blame. Perino’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression",Mostly False,"May 1, 2014"
"Because the EPA closed a lead smelter in Missouri, ""all lead for bullets will have to come from overseas!""","""We, the American public have been blindsided again by the Obama crowd!!!"" warns a chain email. ""Last Lead smelting plant -- gone."" The email goes on to blame the ""Evil Protection Agency"" for shutting down a lead smelting plant, calling it ""backdoor gun control"" and saying it will result in the cost of bullets soaring. ""All lead for bullets will have to come from overseas!"" the email says, adding, ""Long term what this means: Your investment in ammo may be your best investment. Guns will be plentiful but ammo will be another story. How does $3.75 a round (that's for one bullet) for a 9mm work for you?  Box of 50 would only cost you $187.50."" We wondered: Is the email correct to say that all lead for bullets will now have to come from overseas? The Doe Run plant We’ve been down this road before. In December, former Republican U.S. Rep. Allen West of South Florida, stated on his website: ""It seems that back door gun control is in full effect in the United States. Why? Thanks to Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), we can no longer smelt lead from ore in the United States. ... So America, back door gun control is moving forward and while we are all distracted with Obamacare and Iran nuclear negotiations, our Second Amendment rights are undergoing an assault by clandestine infiltration."" We rated West’s claim Pants on Fire. The shuttered smelter, operated by Doe Run, is located in Herculaneum, Mo. Facing regulatory concerns about its air-quality record, Doe Run announced in 2010 that it had reached a settlement with the EPA and the state of Missouri which included paying fines. Then, in December 2013, it shut down. We found no evidence that the EPA’s settlement had anything to do with gun control -- it was about pollution. Ever since the EPA was created in 1970, one of its missions has been to limit pollution from smelters, which are ""terribly toxic sites,"" said David Rosner, a professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University who studies the politics of pollution, told us when we wrote fact-checked West. Lead can accumulate in the body from many sources, and it can severely hamper mental and physical development. ""It had nothing to do with gun control or bullets,"" Rosner told PolitiFact. ""The idea of linking this to an issue of gun control or a surreptitious way for the government trying to shut down the gun industry is nuts. This was an EPA decision because of children who were being poisoned by what had come out of that plant."" Indeed, while the chain email blames Obama, the EPA’s case against Doe Run actually began decades ago. The St. Louis area failed to meet federal clean air standards for lead in 1987 due to emissions from the smelter, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported in 1989. That was during the Reagan administration. Reagan wasn't the only Republican president who presided over an advance in the national anti-lead effort. In 2008, during the tenure of President George W. Bush, the EPA adopted tougher air quality standards for lead that were 10 times more stringent than the past. Doe Run’s primary smelter -- a plant that extracts lead from ore -- was the last primary smelter in the country. But Doe Run continues to operate as a secondary lead smelter -- essentially a recycler for lead contained in other products. That includes -- you guessed it -- bullets. A company spokeswoman told us in December that more than 80 percent of all lead produced in the United States is used in either vehicle batteries or in stationary batteries for backup power used by the military and in telecommunications and medical applications. ""In the U.S., the recycle rate of these batteries is approximately 98 percent, making lead-based batteries the most highly recycled consumer product,"" the company said in a statement. ""These batteries are recycled at secondary lead smelters. We own such a smelter in southern Missouri."" In our previous fact check, Doe Run spokeswoman Tammy Stankey told us that the company ""will continue to supply our ammo customers using secondary lead."" We contacted Stankey again for this fact-check. ""The primary smelter did close, (but) we are still supplying ammo customers through our only secondary smelter,"" she told us. ""We do know that primary lead is being imported to the U.S., but we don’t know if it is specific to ammunition suppliers. ... There are many other uses of lead."" Ammunition experts Now that the Doe Run primary smelter has been shuttered for a few months, we checked back with ammunition experts to see whether there’s any evidence that all lead for bullets now comes from overseas. An NRA spokesman referred us to the National Shooting Sports Foundation. Spokesman Mike Bazinet told us for this fact-check that ""almost all the lead used in ammunition in the U.S. comes from secondary sources, recycled car batteries and other sources of lead. The closing of the lead smelter has not had any effect on ammunition prices or availability. ... Lead for bullets comes from secondary sources, and that was not completely understood by people out there. We certainly tried explain that it's had virtually no effect on ammunition prices."" While some ammunition is imported to the U.S. from overseas, ""it would be pretty heavy stuff to send (lead) across the ocean and put into a bullet. There are secondary sources of lead in sufficient quantity in the United States."" Tom Falone -- president of Clearwater-based Florida Bullet, which supplies ammunition to law-enforcement agencies in Florida -- said its manufacturer has been using reclaimed lead for years. ""I think that by the time we see a shortage, the industry will have found another material to replace the lead with,"" Falone said. Our ruling A chain email said that following closure of a lead smelter in Missouri, ""all lead for bullets will have to come from overseas!"" While the closure of a Doe Run primary lead smelter in December 2013 means there are no smelters to make lead from ore anywhere in the United States, smelters to recycle lead remain in operation, and their output is substantial enough to satisfy the needs of ammunition manufacturers. Four months after that particular smelter closed, we found no evidence that all lead for bullets now comes from overseas",False Pants on Fire,"April 25, 2014"
"The Bundy Ranch deal is all about Nevada Sen. Harry Reid ""using federal violence to take people’s land in his state so he can package it to re-sell it to the Chinese.""","The furor over Cliven Bundy’s cows in Nevada has churned up some powerful speculation about the murky forces at play. A long-running effort by the federal Bureau of Land Management to stop Bundy from letting his cattle forage without paying any grazing fees (on land that was off-limits to grazing in any event) turned into a standoff between federal agents and Bundy’s supporters, both well armed. Out of that drama came the assertion that Nevada Democratic Sen. Harry Reid was behind it all and the goal was personal gain. Reid publicly endorsed federal action against Bundy. A tea party website Republic Broadcasting Network out of Texas put it succinctly. ""It’s very simple. Harry Reid, senator from Nevada, is using federal violence to take people’s land in his state so he can package it to re-sell it to the Chinese. That’s what the Bundy Ranch deal is all about."" This claim and its cousins have been debunked before (a tip of the hat to Snopes). Here’s the gist of its flaws: The government had no interest in Bundy’s property. It wanted his cattle off government land. Reid’s son had represented a Chinese firm that had been interested in developing a solar energy array, but the deal involved land far from the Bundy property and collapsed a year ago. The Bureau of Land Management has identified a desert area for solar power development, but it is about 50 miles away from both the Bundy ranch and the federal land where he likes to graze his cattle. The habitat protections on the land Bundy wants to use were put in place in 1994, long before there was any hint of Chinese interest. Reid's accusers posted an interview with Fabian Calvo, a Los Angeles real estate agent, as evidence to back up their inaccurate claim. Calvo connected the dots between Reid, his son Rory and the Bureau of Land Management. ""Reid’s son is involved with BLM customers, putting together deals right where Clive Bundy’s ranch is,"" Calvo said. ""The federal government is ready to send armed guards in to take peoples land, unconstitutionally, illegally, over what I believe is making sweetheart deals to the Chinese."" An editorial in Investors Business Daily hinted darkly that on March 14, the BLM announced support for the Western Solar Energy Plan. ""Coincidentally, part of that solar energy expansion includes a plan by China's ENN Energy Group to build what would be America's largest solar energy complex,"" the editorial said. ""The site chosen with the guidance of Reid's son, Rory, is in Laughlin, Nev. Laughlin is in Clark County, where Bundy's ranch is."" Clark County covers more than 8,000 square miles. Laughlin is about 100 miles as the crow flies from Bundy’s ranch. As for the ENN Energy Group, there had been a plan to turn 9,000 acres into the nation’s largest solar array. According to press reports, Reid’s son Rory did represent the company, and Reid himself helped recruit the company during a trip to China in 2011. But the deal hinged on nailing down long-term contracts to sell the power the massive facility would generate. When the developers were unable to get those agreements, they backed out. That was in July 2013. Looking at the BLM’s efforts to use federal lands as sites for solar energy, the agency released a list of 17 designated areas in 2012. The Dry Lake Solar Energy Zone is closest to Bundy’s ranch, but that doesn’t make it his neighbor. It is about 5,700 acres large but its closest border is at least 50 miles to the west of Bundy’s property. The BLM did invite energy companies to submit proposals in mid March. This was the final step in a two-year process aimed at managing the environmental impacts of any development that might take place in these zones. That environmental assessment provides one possible link to Bundy and his cows. In order to offset the loss of natural habitat in the development zone, the government typically preserves or restores the same kind of habitat someplace else. The Dry Lake area is home to the desert tortoise, a threatened species. Mike Connor is with the Western Watersheds Project, an environmental conservation group. Connor said Nevada has four areas designated as Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) to protect the desert tortoise. One of those is Gold Butte. That’s the federal land where Bundy has been grazing his cattle. Some of Bundy’s defenders have said that blocking him from Gold Butte would make it easier to build at Dry Lake. ""That really wouldn’t make any sense,"" Connor said. ""Gold Butte was set aside as an ACEC in 1994. You can’t use the same land twice to protect the same habitat. There really is no connection between what’s going on at Dry Lake and what’s going on at Gold Butte."" Our ruling The Republic Broadcasting Network said Sen. Reid was behind the use of force to take away Bundy’s land and sell it to the Chinese. There is nothing accurate about this claim. The dispute involved Bundy’s long use of federal land without a permit. The land gained protected status long before solar energy projects were on the table. The Chinese solar energy proposal no longer exists. The land where such projects might be developed are far from Bundy’s property",False Pants on Fire,"April 24, 2014"
"""Oklahoma’s Republican Gov. Mary Fallin signed a new law which makes you pay a special fee. It will essentially fine people for the crime of using solar power.""","Rachel Maddow sharply criticized Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin on her MSNBC show Monday for imposing a ""sun tax"" on residents who install solar panels or wind turbines to conserve energy and save on their electric bill. But Maddow’s searing attack is misleading, says even a solar energy trade association. Maddow topped her April 21 broadcast with the story of SB 1456, connecting the ""sun tax"" law to conservative-driven efforts in other states to dial back state-approved benefits for utility customers who use alternative energy sources like small wind turbines and solar panels. (In Oklahoma, wind turbines are more prevalent than solar panels, for the record.) ""Tonight Oklahoma’s Republican Gov. Mary Fallin signed a new law which makes you pay a special fee,"" she said. ""It will essentially fine people for the crime of using solar power. If you want to use the sun for electricity instead of your local coal fire power plant, the redder-than-red state Oklahoma government has figured out a way to make you pay for that crime."" But the law mandates no special fee or fine as Maddow says. What SB 1456 does is crack open the door for Oklahoma’s utility companies to apply to charge future ""distributed generation"" customers (the ones who invest in solar and wind energy devices on their properties) a tariff, surcharge, fee, or whatever you want to call it. But that fee or ""fine"" could only come after extensive court-like hearings before a state regulator, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission. And there are questions if that will happen. In signing the proposal into law, Fallin released an executive order that repeatedly stressed the bill does not mean a fee or surcharge is the only way to deal with the concern of utility companies. Fallin ""specifically said the bill does not mandate an increase for solar customers,"" said Bryan Miller, president of the pro-solar group Alliance for Solar Choice. While Miller opposes a fee or surcharge should one come, he said Maddow’s segment missed the mark. Miller called Fallin’s executive order ""a tremendously positive step for the future of Oklahoma in promoting distributed generation."" ""Even without the executive order, it was a very misleading story,"" Miller said. MSNBC spokeswoman Lauren Skowronski said the show stood by its reporting. ""The order declares the governor’s recognition that renewable energy is important, but it does not, in any codified way, meaningfully change what the new law does,"" Skowronski said. ""The law was opposed by advocates of solar power for the very reason that it is designed to impede the expansion of solar usage among Oklahoma consumers, and the governor’s executive order does not change that."" We’ll unpack all of this a little more for you.    Oklahoma’s explanation SB 1456 moved quickly through the Republican-led Oklahoma Legislature. State Rep. Mike Turner, a Republican whom Maddow mocked during her April 21 show for proposing an all-out ban on marriage, was the primary House sponsor of the bill. He introduced it on the Oklahoma House floor this way: ""Members, this bill effectively allows our senior citizens as well as our lower-income individuals in this state to no longer bear the cost of the way that we do accounting."" That’s not a very detailed or transparent explanation for what SB 1456 is really about, but no one asked questions before passing it on an 83-5 vote. (One lawmaker asked Turner a question privately as members voted, and Turner could be heard saying, ""This doesn’t raise, it’s not what people think."") Turner told PunditFact he was not acting at the behest of utilities, the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council or Koch brothers by supporting the Senate bill, as Maddow suggested during her broadcast. Still, a pro-solar Republican group went against him for sponsoring the bill in a video ad suggesting he turned on conservative principles by ""taxing solar."" ""It’s not a tax,"" Turner told PunditFact of his bill. ""You have to be a willing customer."" A self-described opponent of subsidies, Turner says Oklahoma’s 350 or so customers who use wind, solar or other alternative energy devices are being subsidized by other utility customers under current law. Here’s his argument. Most people who have wind- and solar- energy devices are not completely off the grid. They access the grid on cloudy or low-wind days, utilities say. Like most states, Oklahoma has a net-metering law that allows ratepayers who install solar panels and microturbines to sell excess energy they generate for use by their nearest neighbor. The utility, compelled by federal law, must buy back this energy at the retail rate, so the ""seller"" is charged only for their net energy use (what they sell minus what they use). Before Turner’s bill became law, utility companies could not charge solar customers for extracting the excess energy with their infrastructure. Turner says solar panel customers fail to compensate the utility companies for harnessing the extra power. As a result, that additional cost is picked up by other customers. Spokespeople for the state’s two largest utility companies, Oklahoma Gas and Electric and the Public Service Company of Oklahoma, say the current system is giving an unfair break on grid ""maintenance costs"" to customers who use solar or wind power. ""What we credit them for energy they generate greatly exceeds the value of that energy,"" said Stan Whitehouse, Public Service Company of Oklahoma spokesman. ""Distributed generation is no longer in its infancy, and as potential for growth grows, the subsidization will only increase."" This bill could fix that inequity, the utilities say, by letting the state utility regulator ""set up a new rate for distributed generation that would be very clear about here is what you owe to cover the cost of the grid maintenance and here is the amount of electricity you use,"" said Oklahoma Gas and Electric spokeswoman Kathleen O’Shea. Practically speaking, the fee would eat into the credits solar and wind customers accumulate from selling excess energy back to the electrical grid -- a concept that pro-solar groups, including Miller’s Alliance for Solar Choice, oppose. To Maddow, that’s a tax. To Turner, it’s eliminating a subsidy. The law, which goes into effect Nov. 1, says utilities would have to get new charges approved by the end of 2015. What SB 1456 does Specifically, the law modifies a 1970s-era law that prevented utilities from increasing rates or imposing a surcharge because a consumer installed a solar energy device. The change would not affect existing customers. The law says a higher fixed charge for new customers with energy-saving equipment is ""a means to avoid subsidization."" Emphasis on ""a,"" Miller said. ""It says you can have a fee, but it doesn’t say you have to have a fee,"" he said. The practical effect of the bill for future solar and wind customers is unclear until the state’s utility regulator starts the process of reviewing a fee request from a utility. Arguments for and against would be reviewed by an administrative law judge, who would make a recommendation to Oklahoma’s three-person Corporation Commission. The commission could approve the fee or surcharge, reject it, or order additional review. To approve the fee -- and this is important -- the Corporation Commission would need to conclude solar and wind customers are being subsidized by other energy users. Alternative energy users would still save money by selling their excess energy, they’d just save less. The law does not just affect solar users. Mike Bergey, Bergey WindPower Co. president and CEO, sent a letter to Fallin expressing profound disappointment for signing the law because uncertainty about a fee will hurt microturbine sales by dissuading customers interested in investing in a nascent industry. Oklahoma does not offer state incentives for residents who install small-scale solar and wind devices, so ""it’s a rare customer"" who is willing to take the investment leap. A federal tax credit defrays some of the cost of a small $65,000 wind system, but extra utility fees would extend the payback period that customers usually recoup from reduced bills. ""Certainly the utilities will make a strong case for additional charges,"" said Bergey, who said he will fight a proposed utility tariff. ""What the industry is concerned about is they’ll play up the cost ... and ignore the benefits."" Some observers look to what happened in Arizona as a sign of what could come next. There, a utility proposal backed by conservative groups to charge solar customers $50-$100 per month was whittled down to about $5 by the commission. And that executive order?  Fallin’s executive order insisted the bill ""does not mandate tariffs or other increases for distributed generation customers."" Fallin told state agencies to implement the bill in accordance with her energy plan, ""which promotes wind and solar power as important forms of clean energy,"" and for the commission to ""consider the use of all available alternatives, including other rate reforms such as increased use of time-of-use rates, minimum bills, and demand charges."" The executive order isn’t binding, but it provides guidance to the Corporation Commission. Commissioners are elected statewide while vacancies are filled by the governor. ""This will be given all the attention that any changes in rates are given,"" said Mike Skinner, the Corporation Commission spokesman. Still, Fallin’s order is music to solar advocates’ ears. ""Even without the executive order, the bill is just ambiguous and does not mandate any charge,"" Miller said. ""But the executive order lends a lot of clarity to that."" We checked in with TUSK, or Tell Utilities Solar won’t be Killed, a pro-solar group led by Republicans Barry Goldwater Jr., a former California congressman, and Tom Morrissey, former chairman of the Arizona Republican Party. TUSK consultant Jason Rose called Fallin’s executive order indicative of ""Republican adults"" who support customers’ rights to use solar to defray electric costs. ""Do I think (Maddow’s) assessment of the legislative effort was accurate? Yes, I do,"" Rose said. ""Was she unaware, or were her producers unaware, of the executive order that neutered the legislation? Yes."" Our ruling Maddow said, ""Oklahoma's Republican Gov. Mary Fallin signed a new law which makes you pay a special fee. It will essentially fine people for the crime of using solar power."" The law does not make you pay a special fee for using solar power, as Maddow said. What it does do is open the door to a potential fee -- if utility companies can prove that solar and wind customers are being subsidized by other energy consumers. We’re a ways from knowing whether the utilities can make their case and what fee might be assessed. The law does not affect the ability of Oklahoma solar and wind customers to sell excess energy they produce to lower their monthly bill, and even advocates of solar energy say Maddow’s segment missed news in Fallin’s executive order, which stressed ""this bill does not mandate tariffs or other increases"" for people who generate alternative energy. Maddow’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression",Mostly False,"April 24, 2014"
"""From 1972 until 2011, the number of EPA employees increased by 107 percent while the number of total federal personnel decreased by 15 percent.""","U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith has long blamed regulations by the Environmental Protection Agency for the decline of the coal industry across the nation and in his Southwest Virginia district. Griffith, R-9th, introduced a bill to cut 15 percent of the EPA’s budget, saying the agency has grown ""out of control."" ""From 1972 until 2011, the number of EPA employees increased by 107 percent while the number of total federal personnel decreased by 15 percent,"" he said on March 25 during testimony before the House Budget Committee. We wondered whether Griffith’s figures are correct. His spokeswoman, Andrea Pivarunas, sent us sources for the numbers. The EPA had a staff of 8,358 in 1972 and it grew to 17,359 in 2011, according to data from the agency. That’s an increase of 107.7 percent -- matching what Griffith said. We should note that EPA dropped to 15,913 employees last year as many cashed in on an early retirement incentive offered to federal workers. So if Griffith had used the the most current data available, the increase since 1972 would have translated to 90.4 percent. The total number of federal employees was 5.2 million in 1972 and 4.4 million in 2011, according to the federal Office of Personnel Management. That’s a decrease of 15.4 percent -- again, what Griffith said. The federal workforce figure requires elaboration because it includes civilians and uniformed military personnel, which have experienced different trends since 1972. Executive branch civilian employees numbered 2.82 million in 1972 and 2.76 million in 2011, a drop of 2.1 percent. Meanwhile, uniformed military personnel numbered 2.36 million in 1972 and 1.58 million in 2011, a decrease of 33.1 percent. So the reduction in federal employees has more to do with a smaller fighting force than with a shrinking bureaucracy. Now, let’s return to the EPA. What accounted for its sharp rise in employment? The answer is that the agency was barely out of infancy in 1972 when Griffith begins his timeline.   The EPA was created on Dec. 2, 1970, to consolidate environmental quality programs in several federal departments. For example, the Interior Department worked on water quality and pesticides, while the Department of Health, Education and Welfare worked on air pollution, and the Food and Drug Administration conducted pesticides research. In areas where the federal government didn’t have oversight, state or local governments were left to fill in the gaps. Congress passed a number of laws in the 1970s that expanded the EPA’s authority:   Clean Air Act to set national air quality, automobile emission and anti-pollution standards Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention to to restrict lead-based paints in government-subsidized housing, cribs and toys Clean Water Act to control discharges of pollution in surface water Dumping Act to control dumping chemicals and material in the ocean waters Safe Drinking Water Act to regulate public drinking water Resource Conservation and Recovery Act to control hazardous waste from creation to disposal Toxic Substances Control Act to cut health risks from synthetic and organic chemicals Superfund Act to identify those responsible for chemical contamination of land and compel them to clean up the contamination ""The 1970s is known as the environmental decade because so much happened so quickly,"" said Daniel Fiorino, director of American University’s Center for Environmental Policy and a former EPA official. The agency started with 4,084 employees in 1970 and grew to 13,078 in 1980. Employment tapered in the early 1980s, but grew again in the 1990s with a sweeping expansion of the Clean Water Act and as concerns emerged about global warming. The EPA peaked in 1999, with 18,110 employees. From 1980 to 2011, employment at the EPA grew by 32.4 percent while the total number of federal employees -- military and civilian -- dropped by 11.3 percent. Our ruling Griffith said, ""From 1972 until 2011, the number of EPA employees increased by 107 percent while the number of total federal personnel decreased by 15 percent."" There are a few minor issues with Griffith’s choice of dates and numbers, but we won’t quibble. The EPA increase would have dipped below 100 percent if Griffith had used the most current employment figures from 2013. On the other had, Griffith could have made the growth sound more dramatic if he had started his comparison in 1970, when the EPA was born",True,"April 14, 2014"
"""The Koch brothers are one of the biggest polluters in the country.""","When a billionaire speaks, people listen, especially when that billionaire is Charles Koch. Koch, along with his brother David, has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to get the low-tax, low-regulation government he wants. He’s backed the tea party-funded campaign ads to topple Democrats and deployed scores of lobbyists. Koch’s spirited defense in the Wall Street Journal of himself and Koch Industries was everything the talking heads on Fox News’ The Five could have asked for. The resident Democrat, Bob Beckel, set out to skewer the Koch brothers. The rest of the panel, like Greg Gutfeld and Kimberly Guilfoyle, praised them for their philanthropy and business success. Beckel was unimpressed. Beckel: ""The Koch brothers are one of the biggest polluters in the country."" Gutfeld: ""They pollute us with money."" (While this could be taken differently, this was praise.) Beckel: ""They pollute this country."" Guilfoyle: ""You don’t have any evidence to substantiate that."" Beckel: ""Yes, I do."" We tried to reach Beckel to hear about his evidence, but we got no response. What we found in its place was a report from the left-leaning Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. Last year, the institute released two lists of the 100 firms with the most significant emissions in the nation. One list is for air and the other is for water. On the first, Koch Industries ranked 14th. On the second, it ranked 30th. Some of the companies ranking high on both lists include ExxonMobil, BASF, Bayer Group and Dow Chemical. Behind these rankings is data reported by companies to the Environmental Protection Agency and compiled in something called the Toxics Release Inventory. The Toxics Release Inventory provides the numbers of pounds of waste chemicals released into the environment by each facility. Every facility operates under a permit from the EPA. The EPA then takes this release information and runs it through a computer model that factors in the toxicity of the chemicals, how they get moved around and how close they are to population centers. What emerges is a score. (The technical name is the Risk Screening Environmental Indicator.) This score is a measure of risk. It doesn’t mean that a facility actually poses a threat to health, but a score that is 10 times higher than another means the ""the potential for risk is 10 times higher,"" according to the EPA. This method has been around since 1991 and been reviewed and refined several times since then. It’s important to remember that this information is just for each particular plant. What the researchers at Amherst do is tie each plant to its corporate owner and come up with a total score for a company. ""The match of facilities to the companies that own them is a substantial effort for us,"" said Michael Ash, chair of the economics department at UMass-Amherst and head of the project. To repeat, it’s by this measure that Koch Industries ranks 14th in the country in terms of companies sending emissions into the air and 30th in sending emissions into the water. The top air polluter, according to the analysis, is Precision Castparts. The top water polluter is Ohio Valley Electric. We wanted to know if there is anything analytically wrong with adding up the scores the way Ash's group does. We found that the business magazine Forbes has reported these results without challenging them. An environmental economist, Nicolaas Bouwes, who helped develop the Risk Screening Environmental Indicator at the EPA, told PunditFact that there is ""no problem aggregating the numbers."" ""The point of the model was to identify problem actors,"" Bouwes said. ""If you are at #14, there are issues to look into."" Koch Industries did not dispute the findings. ""Koch’s TRI (Toxic Release Inventory) number is what it is because we have a large number of U.S. manufacturing sites and we're a U.S.-based company,"" said spokesman Rob Tappan. Tappan is correct that Koch Industries has a large number of plants. It operates over 100 facilities that produce everything from plywood, to asphalt, to jet fuel. One of its companies makes Brawny paper towels. That water you bought at the store might come in a bottle made of plastic from a Koch Industries plant. The company runs nearly twice as many sites as the corporation with the next-largest number of plants, Honeywell, which has about 60. You would expect that releases would go up with each additional facility. On the other hand, when we dipped into the EPA’s data (using the database on the Right To Know Network), we found that on average, each Koch plant generated about five times as much as each Honeywell plant. Roughly speaking, the comparison was about 500,000 pounds of chemical releases compared to about 100,000. So the number of plants alone doesn’t explain the Koch brothers’ high numbers. Tappan underscored that the Political Economy Research Institute (the University of Massachusetts-Amherst group) has ""radical"" roots. Ash, he noted is a member of the Union for Radical Political Economics. That organization's website proclaims that it ""presents a continuing critique of the capitalist system and all forms of exploitation and oppression while helping to construct a progressive social policy and create socialist alternatives."" While that perspective is not mainstream, that by itself does not invalidate the institute’s findings. Tappan also notes that ""our manufacturing emissions meet all EPA standards, and we work hard to exceed them."" However, Koch Industries paid a $30 million civil fine in January 2000 for its role in more than 300 spills from oil pipelines and facilities in six states. At the time, the fine was the largest civil fine levied under any environmental law, according to the EPA. And last month, leaks at a Texas chemical plant cost the company a $350,000 fine with the promise to invest $45 million in equipment upgrades. Our ruling Beckel said that the Koch brothers are one of the country’s biggest polluters. In this fact-check, we're talking about the Kochs' company, Koch Industries. Koch Industries operates over 100 plants across the country. According to one ranking, it is not responsible for the most significant releases but it does land within the top 30 on one list and the top 15 on another. Most people would count that as ""one of the biggest."" Most of those releases are legal under EPA permits. The EPA does not consider this level of pollution to pose a health risk in and of itself. However, it is still pollution",True,"April 9, 2014"
"""EPA officials have commended (Koch Industries) for our ‘commitment to a cleaner environment’ and called us ‘a model for other companies.’ ""","For several weeks now, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has taken to the chamber floor to malign David and Charles Koch, the billionaire brothers who contribute heavily to libertarian causes and bankroll ads critical of Democrats. On April 2, 2014, Charles Koch fired back in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, arguing that Reid’s comments were disrespectful and a bad sign for democracy. And he defended Koch Industries and their subsidiaries against attacks, including claims that they oppose environmental protections. ""Koch employees have earned well over 700 awards for environmental, health and safety excellence since 2009, many of them from the Environmental Protection Agency and Occupational Safety and Health Administration,"" Koch wrote. ""EPA officials have commended us for our ‘commitment to a cleaner environment’ and called us ‘a model for other companies.’ "" Subsidiaries of Koch Industries include manufacturers like paper maker Georgia Pacific and INVISTA, a textile fiber producer. It also owns companies that deal with excavation of natural resources like Flint Hills Resources and Koch Pipeline. As you can imagine, these are industries that are heavily regulated by federal agencies like the EPA. So does the EPA think Koch Industries is a model environmentalist? We decided to explore that claim. Tracking down the quotes Quotes can often be taken out of context, so we thought it would be useful to understand exactly what the EPA said about Koch Industries and their subsidiaries. A spokesman for Koch Industries was able to provide a pair of press releases with the full quotes. So did the EPA call Koch Industries a ""model for other companies""? Kinda, but not really. The EPA was complimentary of one specific agreement reached in 2010 with Koch subsidiary Flint Hills Resources after the agency raised concerns about permits for a refinery in Texas. ""The process we have agreed to with Flint Hills Resources is an excellent one, and we look forward to working with the company to complete the work to transition their permits,"" stated Al Armendariz, Regional Administrator for EPA Region 6. ""It is our hope that the FHR process will serve as a model for other companies seeking to transition to federally-approved permits."" As you can see, they were very complimentary of the process in this one instance for this refinery in Texas. But it wasn’t really a blanket statement of the company or Koch Industries. Let’s move on to whether the EPA has commended Koch Industries for their ""commitment to a cleaner environment."" This one has more truth to it, but again, in a limited context. In 2009, Georgia Pacific was named a SmartWay Excellence Award recipient by the EPA. SmartWay is a private-public program run by the EPA that links up manufacturers and retailers with transportation services to ""improve fuel efficiency and the environmental performance ... of the goods movement supply chains."" Georgia Pacific was given the award because the company increased its partnership with SmartWay-approved carriers and grew more efficient in their distribution models. According to a Georgia Pacific press release, here’s the full quote from the EPA official: ""I commend Georgia-Pacific for its leadership in promoting sustainable transportation practices through the SmartWay Transport Partnership,"" said Margo T. Oge, director of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality, EPA. ""These actions demonstrate a commitment to a cleaner environment and more secure energy supply."" An EPA spokeswoman told PolitiFact that the statement was solely ""about GP’s transportation practices as a member of SmartWay,"" and not an assessment of the entire company. Interestingly, the EPA used identical language in 2000 after reaching a clean air agreement with Koch Petroleum Group and BP Amoco. But the accord was only finalized after Koch was forced to pay a $4.5 million penalty and spend $80 million to improve emissions in three refineries. ""BP Amoco and Koch took the initiative to begin talks with EPA earlier this spring rather than wait for possible EPA enforcement action,"" the EPA said in a press release. ""In return for the company’s cooperation and ambitious commitment to a cleaner environment, EPA has offered a ‘clean slate’ for certain past violations, and greater flexibility and incentives for new technology."" So in this case, ""commitment to a cleaner environment"" only came after the EPA threatened enforcement actions. What else has EPA said about Koch Industries? While those positive quotes about Koch Industries and their subsidies are at least partially accurate, it’s a lopsided picture of the EPA’s dealings with the company in the last two decades. Since the late 1990s, Koch companies have repeatedly found themselves in the crosshairs of the EPA for various environmental violations. On numerous occasions they were forced to pay hefty fines and settlements and change their practices as a result of EPA and Justice Department action. The bulk of the more serious violations occurred years ago, but there have been other actions taken recently as well. Here’s a sampling: In 1999, Koch Industries was found guilty of negligence and malice after two teens in Texas died as a result of an underground pipe leaking butane, according to reports. In January 2000, Koch Industries was forced to pay a $30 million civil penalty, ""the largest civil fine ever imposed on a company under any federal environmental law"" and $5 million in cleanup efforts to resolve claims of more than 300 spills from oil pipelines in six states.

""This record civil penalty sends a clear message to those who transport hazardous materials: You cannot endanger public health or the environment,"" said Attorney General Janet Reno. ""We will not let you foul our water and spoil our land by breaking the law."" In March 2000, the Koch Petroleum Group was sentenced to pay $6 million in criminal fines and $2 million in remediation costs — the largest federal fine ever paid in Minnesota at the time — after it was found that one of their refineries polluted waterways and wetlands in Minnesota before 1997. According to a press release, ""Koch admitted that it negligently discharged aviation fuel into a wetland and an adjoining waterway. Even though Koch was aware of the problem, it did not develop a comprehensive plan to recover between 200,000-600,000 gallons of released fuel until June 1997."" In September 2000, Koch Industries was indicted for environmental crimes at a refinery the company owned in Texas. They eventually paid a $25 million fine after pleading guilty to one criminal charge.

""Companies that produce dangerous pollutants simply cannot focus on profit and efficiency at the expense of a community's health,"" said Lois Schiffer, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the environment at the Justice Department. ""We will continue to find and prosecute those who would flout our environmental laws."" In February 2013, Koch Nitrogen Company paid a $380,000 fine for failing to create a risk management program for facilities producing and storing ammonia products in Iowa and Kansas. In March 2014, Flint Hills Resources paid a $350,000 fine for leaky equipment at a Texas chemical plant that allowed hazardous air pollutants into the atmosphere. Though the EPA also credited the company for implementing what it described as ""innovative technologies"" in the plant to capture pollutants. Our ruling In his op-ed, Charles Koch wrote that ""EPA officials have commended us for our ‘commitment to a cleaner environment’ and called us ‘a model for other companies.’ "" Actually, the EPA was focusing on very limited aspects of Koch Industries and not the company as a whole. Further, Koch Industries has a history with the EPA that was completely glossed over, and it includes multiple violations of rules.

"""There are over 100 pipelines between the United States and Canada right now.""","Former Gov. Jeb Bush says the Keystone XL Pipeline is a ""no-brainer."" Bush took a question on the pipeline after a speech to the business and civic group Broward Workshop. AutoNation CEO Mike Jackson asked him this: ""Just as a symbol -- as a symbol -- would you have approved something like the Keystone Pipeline or would you have studied it for eight years?"" Bush responded: ""I read something that was quite interesting. There are over 100 pipelines between the United States and Canada right now. Give me a break. What are we arguing about here?"" We’re not going to weigh in on the pros and cons of expanding the pipeline but we can fact-check whether there are already 100 pipelines between the United States and Canada. Keystone Pipeline Keystone XL is a proposed pipeline that would carry 830,000 barrels per day of diluted oil sands from Western Canada to Nebraska and then to refineries on the Gulf Coast. Earlier in March, the U.S. State Department concluded the public comment period about the project. After six years of contentious debate between environmentalists and pipeline supporters, the decision now lies with President Barack Obama. We sent Bush’s claim to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which referred us to an October 2013 Congressional Research Service report. The report stated that CRS ""has identified over 100 operating or proposed oil, natural gas, and electric transmission facilities crossing the U.S.-Mexico or U.S.-Canada border."" A Bush spokesperson later referred us to this report as well. Bush had said there were over ""100 pipelines between the United States and Canada right now,"" but the CRS report refers to operating and proposed facilities crossing the border with Canada or Mexico. With help from FERC and the Pipeline Safety Trust, a safety watchdog group, we counted the pipelines in the tables of the report and found 29 natural gas pipelines crossing the U.S.-Canada border and about 17 oil pipelines crossing the U.S.-Canada border. Philippe Reicher, a spokesman for the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association, told PolitiFact that the National Energy Board, which regulates pipelines crossing the border between Canada and the United States, has indicated that they have approximately 80 pipelines crossing the border. ""That would include oil, gas, water, etc.,"" he wrote in an email. ""In terms of large transmission pipeline systems similar to the proposed Keystone XL, we are probably looking between 18 and 22."" Lorne Stockman, research director at Oil Change International, a group that opposes Keystone, pointed to a map from the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, which shows all the existing and proposed liquids pipelines crossing the border.   ""Some of these carry products rather than crude, and only a handful currently carry tar sands crude,"" Stockman told PolitiFact. ""Looks quite busy on this map, but I think we can all agree that  100 is a little overstated."" Our ruling Bush said, ""There are over 100 pipelines between the United States and Canada right now."" Bush has a point that there are a number of major oil and gas pipelines that already cross the U.S.-Canada border. But his number is significantly off. A 2013 Congressional Research Service report referred to 100 pipelines, but that included operating or proposed oil, natural gas, and electric transmission lines, and it counted pipelines crossing both the U.S.-Mexico border and the U.S.-Canada border. If we only count operating pipelines that cross the Canadian border, we count 29 natural gas pipelines and 17 oil pipelines, for a total of 46",Mostly False,"March 26, 2014"
"Says he ""forced Washington to open up the Arctic Ocean to oil drilling.""","As a Democratic senator from Alaska -- a state that President Barack Obama lost by 14 points in 2012 -- it’s been in Mark Begich’s best interest to distance himself from many of the president’s policies as the midterm elections approach. But there’s one topic where Begich has been touting his ability to influence Obama -- oil drilling, a crucial issue for Alaskans, whose economy is heavily dependent on oil production. In Begich’s latest statewide TV ad, the narrator -- Begich’s wife, Deborah Bonito -- highlights his commitment to fighting for Alaskan issues, including drilling. ‘There’s nowhere he won’t go to listen and stand up for Alaskans,"" the ad says. ""He forced Washington to open up the Arctic Ocean to oil drilling."" We thought we’d take a closer look at Begich’s involvement in the Alaska Arctic drilling. When Royal Dutch Shell started fighting to drill in the Arctic, Begich wasn’t yet in office. By February 2008, Royal Dutch Shell held leases to drill in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, portions of the Arctic Ocean near the Alaskan mainland. No one had drilled there for two decades. But lease-holding companies can’t drill without first clearing a number of other procedural hurdles. Once it had sold Shell leases, the government still needed to grant dozens of technical approvals, including exploration plans, water permits and air permits. That’s where Begich, the only Democrat elected statewide, came in. After getting elected in November 2008, he made his priorities known to the White House. The New York Times reported that when Begich and Obama first met in 2008, Begich said of oil drilling issues, ""If I’m elected, this is what I’m going to focus on."" Begich -- a Democrat working with a Democratic administration -- may have had more sway than his colleague, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, in pushing along the permitting process. Peter Van Tuyn, whose law firm Bessenyey and Van Tuyn LLC has fought against oil drilling in the Alaskan Arctic, agrees that Begich has had a key role on the issue. ""His biggest influence has been picking up the phone or having those people into his office or in hearings and saying ‘Dammit, we need to get this done,’ "" Van Tuyn said. Begich told the Times that ""any time (Obama) initiated a call, I felt that was carte blanche to make my case"" for Arctic drilling. As of 2012, Begich had assembled a six-page chronology of contact on oil drilling between his office and the White House. Eventually, in September 2012, Shell began drilling in the Chukchi Sea. However, it didn’t go according to plan. After spending $5 billion on the project, Shell wasn’t able to fully drill any wells that season. In March 2013, an Interior Department report found that Shell had violated permits, didn’t test certain systems in advance and lost a drilling rig. After that, Shell said it still planned to drill during the summer of 2014. But the company backed out in January after a court sided with environmental groups in ruling that in 2008, the federal government had underestimated how much oil drilling would happen when awarding the lease. This ruling didn’t block all drilling, but it did put more legal obstacles in Shell’s way. The administration could choose to appeal the decision, which only directly affects one lease sale, not all Arctic lease sales. Shell’s CEO said there was too much uncertainty to move forward with drilling in 2014. Other companies have leases to drill in the area as well, but experts told us they’ve hung back and waited to see how Shell does. So, in 2014, no companies are drilling in the Alaska Arctic, despite the efforts of Begich and others. Our ruling Begich’s ad claimed that ""he forced Washington to open up the Arctic Ocean to oil drilling."" Begich wasn’t in the Senate when the government awarded leases to Shell, but the leases were only the first step toward drilling in the Arctic Ocean. Numerous other federal permits were required before Shell could drill there, and by multiple accounts, Begich played a key role in pushing the administration from the time he began serving in the Senate. Shell did drill in 2012 -- the first activity in that region of the Arctic in decades -- though after complications arose, including legal ones, the company hasn’t done so again. So Begich can rightfully take credit for helping advancing Shell’s oil-drilling permits in the Arctic Ocean, but there’s currently no drilling taking place",Mostly True,"March 24, 2014"
"The Republican-controlled Wisconsin Senate approved a bill ""denying veterans the right to recover their medical costs for cancers they developed while serving their country.""","On March 12, 2014, the Republican-controlled Wisconsin state Senate approved several pieces of legislation that dismayed Democrats. The same day, Senate Minority Leader Chris Larson of Milwaukee pounced on three of the bills, citing them in a fund-raising email he sent on behalf of a committee that works to elect Democrats to the Senate. One of the bills, Larson wrote, is ""denying veterans the right to recover their medical costs for cancers they developed while serving their country."" Fund-raising letters often make startling claims, like ""denying"" rights. Let’s see how this one does on the Truth-O-Meter. The bill The bill Larson cites is due for a vote in the state Assembly on March 20, 2014. Gov. Scott Walker has not said whether he would sign it. The bill would change requirements for anyone who files a lawsuit claiming they contracted an illness, often cancer, as a result of exposure to asbestos. So, despite Larson’s claim, the bill does not target veterans. That being said, veterans, particularly those who served in the Navy, make up a large percentage of people with mesothelioma, one type of cancer caused by asbestos exposure. Some studies show that as many as 30 percent of all Americans with mesothelioma cancer are veterans who were exposed while on active duty, according to Mesothelioma.com. There are two ways that a person with asbestos-related cancer can seek to recover money for their medical costs and other damages: 1. File a lawsuit against a company that manufactured or used asbestos. 2. File a claim with one or more trusts that were set up by now-bankrupt companies to pay victims of asbestos-related illnesses. Under the bill, cancer victims suing an existing company would have to disclose whether they have also filed a claim with any of the asbestos trusts. And if they haven’t already done so, the judge handling the lawsuit could order them to file a claim with one or more of the trusts. Under that scenario, if the lawsuit is resolved in a settlement or at trial and it is determined that the cancer victim be paid damages, the parties or the jury could determine how much should be paid by the existing business being sued and how much, if any, should be paid by trusts. Opponents of the bill worry that a veteran could end up collecting less money, because the funds in some trusts have been depleted, while supporters see the possible apportionment of blame as a matter of fairness. Before we close, a little more from each side: -- Opponents of the bill include the American Legion, Wisconsin Veterans of Foreign Wars and the Military Order of the Purple Heart. They say the the bill could delay a trial for six months or more -- and given that Mesothelioma victims typically die within about a year or less of being diagnosed, a veteran could become incapacitated or die before the trial, hurting the chances of the veteran or the veteran’s family to collect damages. Moreover, if a jury decides an existing business is responsible for damages, the veteran stands a strong chance of collecting a full amount. But if the jury decides that a trust is responsible for some of the damages, it’s possible the veteran wouldn’t collect that entire amount because some trusts are depleted. -- Supporters of the bill include the National Federation of Independent Business, Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce and the AMVETS veterans group. They say there wouldn’t be any significant delays in asbestos trials because attorneys representing cancer victims would know before filing any lawsuit that they also have to file a claim with an asbestos trust. And even now, it can take up to a year before an asbestos lawsuit goes to trial, so many veterans videotape their testimony in case they die before the trial begins. The supporters also say the bill would stop so-called double dipping: a cancer victim collecting damages from the company they sue and then filing claims for more money with one or more of the trusts. Double dipping arguably depletes funds available for other cancer victims who have legitimate claims. Our rating Larson said the Republican-controlled Wisconsin Senate approved a bill ""denying veterans the right to recover their medical costs for cancers they developed while serving their country."" The bill does not target veterans and does not deny their right to seek compensation, both from existing and now-bankrupt asbestos-related companies, for cancer they contracted as a result of serving in the military. But Larson’s claim contains an element of truth, in that the bill could result in some veterans collecting less money from legal actions than they could under the current system for seeking compensation",Mostly False,"March 20, 2014"
"Earth ""has not warmed for the last 17 years.""","Fox News pundit Sean Hannity set the stage for a screaming match on climate change when he invited liberal Bob Beckel of The Five to debate Patrick Moore, a former Greenpeace activist who says there is no proof man is contributing to a warming planet. Beckel criticized Moore for his work as a spokesman for the nuclear energy industry and for saying carbon emissions go back into trees and food rather than the atmosphere. ""Come on, Patrick. You know better than that,"" Beckel said during the March 11 edition of Hannity. But Moore said cries about climate change are actually just about fits of weather. ""Basically, they're just saying weather these days,"" Moore said. ""They're saying the weather is climate change, but that's not true. Weather is just weather, like the cold weather we're getting this year. It has not warmed for the last 17 years. We know that for sure. And that brings into question the whole hypothesis."" PunditFact wanted to know if the Earth has not warmed for the last 17 years, and what it means if anything for the theory of climate change. We found clues, and seeming contradictions to his claim, in the PolitiFact archive. Lately it’s been hot a lot President Barack Obama warned the nation there will be consequences from not doing more to combat climate change in his 2013 State of the Union address, pointing out ""the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15."" PolitiFact rated his statement True. (Actually it’s 13 or 14 of the last 15.) But that doesn’t necessarily rule out Moore’s claim about the earth not getting warmer lately. The statements can co-exist, with some additional context. Moore’s claim is a popular argument of people who say climate change isn’t real. The problem is it is cherry-picked and leaves out the rest of the story about earth’s dramatic temperature increases over the last century. NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies tracks global land-ocean temperatures using a temperature index. 
 (The index shows the temperature anomaly of each year. The temperature anomaly shows how a year's land-ocean temperatures compares with the longterm average. A higher anomaly, such as 0.67 degrees Celsius in 2010, shows how much warmer a year was than the longterm average. A negative anomaly, last seen in 1976, indicates a cooler year than the referenced period.) As you can see, Earth’s land-ocean temperatures escalated starting in the 1970s, setting off a new era of rising sea levels, increased greenhouse gas emissions and melting sea ice. Temperatures spiked about 17 years ago in 1998, an outlier year that involved a strong El Niño with abnormally warm ocean temperatures. Since then, temperatures have remained relatively, but not entirely flat. That’s the basis for Moore’s claim. There are several problems with his analysis, however. Data for 2014 isn’t available yet. So really there are only 16 data points (years) between 1998 and 2014. If you include 1997 to the analysis, Moore is clearly wrong. The years 2005 and 2010 were both warmer than 1998, though only slightly. That also makes Moore’s statement technically inaccurate, though most scientists agree that temperatures have remained relatively flat recently. Moore cherry-picked a year when temperatures spiked. ""What was an extraordinary event in 1998 is now the new normal,"" said Goddard Institute program analyst Reto Ruedy, program manager at NASA’s Goddard Institute. Moore would be incorrect if he chose 1999, 1997, 1996 or any year before that. ""If you start with an extremely warm year, the warming trend going forward is going to be mostly flat,"" said Gordon Hamilton, associate research professor at the Climate Change Institute at the University of Maine. ""You could easily choose 1999 and 1996 and you would find that there’s an upward trend,"" said  Kevin Trenberth, a distinguished senior scientist in the climate analysis section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. ""It’s cherry-picking to get the result that he apparently desires."" Moore’s response While Moore used the 17-year-statistic on Hannity to make the argument that climate change isn’t happening, he told us the figure ""does not prove much."" Moore said NOAA and NASA recordkeeping only go back 150 years and the planet’s temperature has fluctuated over the course of time. It is cooler now than for ""most of life history,"" he said. ""It is a pause, flat, whatever you want to call it, for 17 years,"" Moore said. Hamilton and Ruedy dismissed Moore’s qualms, saying the 150-year record is reliable to determine statistically significant trends. For pre-19th century estimates, scientists use other methods, such as tree rings and ice core bubbles, to detect climate trends, Ruedy said. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group operating under the United Nations that reviews climate change research, has concluded the warming of the climate is ""unprecedented over decades to millennia."" Moore’s Greenpeace ties A final note about Moore. In his interview on Hannity and in many other places, Moore has been described as a ""founder"" of Greenpeace. The organization, however, disputes that. Greenpeace devotes a webpage to explaining Moore’s lack of credentials, though they agree he was involved in the group’s early days. The group was founded in 1970 as the Don’t Make a Wave Committee with the goal of stopping an American nuclear weapons test on Amchitka Island in the Aleutians. Moore, a college student, wrote a letter to the group in 1971 asking to join the crew of activists sailing to protest the nuclear test. Moore was one of three Greenpeace members on board the Phyllis Cormack, which carried a dozen passengers to Amchitka Island for the protest. Greenpeace says the group’s founders include seven people, but not Moore. Greenpeace leaders voted Moore out of his positions as director of Greenpeace Canada and one of five directors of Greenpeace International, and Moore left in 1986, said Greenpeace spokesman David Pomerantz. He served as a consultant and co-chairman of the nuclear industry-funded Clean and Safe Energy Coalition until he retired from it in 2013. Our ruling Moore said the whole theory of climate change is called into question because ""it has not warmed for the last 17 years."" It’s true that global surface temperatures have remained relatively flat for 17 years, since 1998. However, both 2005 and 2010 were warmer than 1998. Moore’s statement alone ignores that the first decade of the 21st century was the warmest on record. And Moore is cherry-picking a timeframe to support his argument by starting at an extremely warm year. Global surface temperatures have risen, for instance, if you started at 1999, 1996, or any year before that.

An ad from the company asks: ""Do you know that most all mills in Oregon have retooled over the past 20 years?""","A good way to get an argument roaring louder than a chain saw is to bring up Northwest forest policy. Topics ranging from clear-cutting to what constitutes ""old growth"" are bound to spark tussles. Forestry issues are again in the news as U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and other members of the state’s congressional delegation pitch plans to increase harvest levels from the so-called O&C lands -- 2.4 million acres of federally owned forestlands sprawled across 18 western Oregon counties. Many are watching closely, knowing decisions coming out of Washington, D.C., could have controversial implications for Oregon. Among those following the debate are Aaron Jones’ three daughters. Jones opened his Seneca Jones sawmill in Eugene more than 60 years ago. Becky, Kathy and Jody Jones are taking out newspaper ads touting the benefits of ""forestry stewardship,"" among other things. An ad that ran in Oregon newspapers, including The Oregonian, on March 2, 2014, presses for more timber harvests and seeks to allay fears that old growth will be cut. It says mills are now focused on second-generation trees, and claims: ""Do you know that most all mills in Oregon have retooled over the past 20 years?"" We revved up our saw and checked. We called Kathy Jones. She said the ads are aimed at influencing the debate over O&C lands, which could yield increased timber for Oregon sawmills. ""Some people keep saying we are ruining the forests, that we are cutting old growth at every opportunity,"" Jones said. ""It’s just not true. What is true is that almost every mill still operating in Oregon has retooled to accept second-growth logs. ""And I’m fine with that. I love those big cathedral forests. They should stay just as they are."" Jones said her definition of old growth begins when a tree’s diameter reaches 48 inches. The logs Seneca accepts average about 30 inches, she said. As for Seneca’s own retooling efforts, Jones said lasers now scan all incoming logs. Computers tell operators what sizes of studs and other lumber are most in demand at the moment, and the cutting begins. ""We have almost as many computer operators as we do people out on the floor,"" Jones said. ""That’s how this industry operates these days."" We called Paul Barnum, executive director of the Oregon Forest Resources Institute. The Legislature created the group in 1991 to bring forest scientists, public agencies, forest landowners and community and conservation groups together. Barnum referred us to a 2012 report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Pacific Northwest Research Station. A chapter assessing Oregon’s sawmill sector said, in part, ""Technological improvements have made Oregon mills more efficient in numerous ways. Log size (diameter and length) sensing capabilities linked to computer determine the best sawing pattern for logs to recover either the greatest volume or greatest value from each other."" We asked Barnum about the Seneca Jones claim. ""There may be three or four mills that still process old-growth timber, which comes pretty much from private forestlands,"" he said. ""The mills still operating have retooled to concentrate on getting more value from second- and third-generation timber."" Barnum also passed along a report from Paul F. Ehinger & Associates, which said that in 2010 -- the last time the numbers were updated -- Oregon had 106 operating sawmills. For another view, we called Steve Pedery, conservation director at Oregon Wild. The group has long fought clear-cutting and old-growth harvesting, but has won U.S. Forest Service awards in recent years for helping design timber-restoration sales. Pedery passed along an Oregon Wild report detailing nine westside mills that still accept large logs. ""What this highlights,"" he said, ""is that there is still an appetite for old growth out there. If they could get it, they would."" Regarding the retooling claim, he said: ""Saying ‘most’ misses the point of the policy debate. There are still mills looking for large-diameter trees and they are all in southwest Oregon, where the remaining big trees are."" One of the mills in the report, D.R. Johnson Lumber in Riddle, is currently mothballed, according to both the report and an employee who answered our call there. Another listed as accepting large-diameter logs is Rough & Ready Lumber Co. in Cave Junction. Coincidentally, that operation announced this month that it will soon reopen a retooled small-log mill that’s been closed since last year. ""Unless you are a real niche operation looking for the occasional large log that comes along, you’ve retooled,"" said co-owner Jennifer Phillippi, whose grandfather founded Rough and Ready 92 years ago. ""You wouldn’t still be in business otherwise."" The ruling The owners of Seneca Jones sawmill in Eugene want harvest levels from federally managed O&C lands increased but with primarily second- and third-generation trees. They say the timber industry agrees, adding, ""Most all mills in Oregon have retooled over the past 20 years"" to accept smaller trees. A key environmental group maintains that old-growth cutting would commence if rules pertaining to federal lands are changed. The ongoing debate over timber policy in Washington, D.C., will determine whether they are. But we can look at the numbers, which show that of the 106 or so mills in Oregon, only a handful have not retooled and still look to buy large-diameter logs. The overwhelming majority, according to a forestry group created by the Legislature, use machinery that’s been added in recent years to accept smaller logs. It bears out the assertion that ""most all"" sawmills have retooled",True,"March 14, 2014"
"""We have invested record funding in protecting our environment.""","So we know Gov. Rick Scott likes to portray himself as the jobs-promoter-in-chief but what about tree-hugger-in-chief? During his fourth State of the state speech March 4, Scott began by reeling off a list of recent accomplishments. ""A lot has happened since I spoke to you last year. I can talk about how our unemployment rate is now down to 6.3 percent. How our crime rate is at a 42-year low. How we have invested record funding in protecting our environment....."" Some of those numbers sounded familiar to us. But we hadn’t heard Scott’s claim that during his tenure we have invested record funding to protect the environment, so we decided to fact-check that claim. Funding to restore springs We asked Scott’s spokesman to provide us with documentation to support his claim that during his tenure Florida had invested record funding on environmental protection. Spokesman John Tupps told PolitiFact Florida in an email that Scott was referring to his proposed budget that includes a ""record $55 million"" to protect and restore springs -- ""building upon last year’s investment of more than $37 million."" Funding for springs is only a subset of funding for environmental protection, but we’ll look at the status of springs funding first. As of early March, the Legislature hadn’t voted on the amount for springs protection. It’s possible the Legislature will set an even higher amount: A coalition of Senate committee chairs drafted a bill to raise $400 million for springs from documentary stamp taxes on real estate transactions. The state has more than 1,000 freshwater springs, and many are suffering from nitrate pollution that fuels the growth of toxic algae blooms. Geologists have found an increase in saltiness in a few freshwater springs, which could signal future problems with the state's drinking supply, the Tampa Bay Times reported. In 2013, the state asked water management districts for a list of projects essential to springs restoration and received a list of about $122 million. The Legislature set aside $10 million, but the total climbed to $37 million, once other sources including local government money was included. ""If the Legislature passes Gov. Scott’s $55 million springs recommendation it will be a record level of spending for Florida’s springs,"" Eric Draper, Executive Director Audubon Florida, told PolitiFact Florida. Annual DEP funding Though Scott’s spokesman said he was referring to money proposed for springs protection, his claim was more broadly about the environment, so we asked the Department of Environmental Protection, called DEP, for the bottom-line budget total for each year during Scott’s tenure. We found similar figures back to 2004, during the tenure of his predecessors, Govs. Charlie Crist Jeb Bush. Here is the bottom line total each year: 2004-05: $2.1 billion 2005-06: $2 billion 2006-07: $2.9 billion 2007-08: $2.4 billion 2008-09: $2 billion 2009-10: $1.3 billion 2010-11: $1.4 billion 2011-12: $1.8 billion 2012-13: $1.4 billion 2013-14: $1.3 billion These numbers come with some caveats: they are appropriation numbers, not actual expenditures, and they combine state and federal dollars. In several of those years, the numbers included debt service payments of more than $400 million. It’s no surprise that the dollar amounts were higher in flush financial times under Bush and part of Crist’s term and then plummeted along with the economy in the second half of Crist’s tenure and Scott’s tenure. We have seen the same pattern for other state spending priorities. Spokespersons for DEP and Scott also cited other environmental projects Scott has supported -- including an $880 million water quality plan to provide clean water to the Everglades. Facing the prospect of court-ordered cleanup, in 2012 the state reached a settlement with the federal government to end a long-standing dispute about Everglades cleanup. All of the $880 million won’t be spent this year; it is a 13-year agreement. For this year, Scott proposed $130 million for Everglades, which includes part of that $880 million, as well as other state and water management district sources. ""Scott has skillfully negotiated the Everglades deal with EPA, which gives him a talking point of boosting environmental programs in Florida,"" said Jerry Phillips, a DEP attorney in the 1990s who is now an environmental watchdog. ""But the reality is that Bush and Crist had been negotiating with EPA for years as well, on issues such as the Everglades."" Environmental cuts The total DEP budget doesn’t tell the full story because other agencies also do work that relates to protecting the environment. We interviewed several environmentalists who pointed to Scott’s lack of investment in protecting the environment. We will cite some of their examples: • In 2011 Scott and the Legislature abolished the Department of Community Affairs, which for decades reviewed development plans in cities and counties. • In 2011, Scott and lawmakers forced state water management districts to slash property tax collections. The South Florida Water Management District’s total budget dropped from about $1 billion in 2011 to $622 million in 2014. Water management districts handle planning for water resources and wetlands protection, among other environmental issues. • In December 2012, DEP laid off 58 employees. • The number of enforcement cases handled by DEP has dropped dramatically, from 2,289 in 2010 (Crist’s final year) to 799 in 2012, the Tampa Bay Times reported. As of the end of May, only 145 new cases had been filed. • For many years the Legislature invested $300 million a year in Florida Forever, a program to buy land with money from a tax on real estate transactions. During the economic downturn, the Legislature pulled back. In 2010, Crist’s final year, the program received $15 million. In 2011, Scott proposed zeroing out Florida Forever (it ultimately got $744,000), and then in 2012 he signed a budget that included about $8 million. In 2013, lawmakers approved $20 million and directed the state to sell off $50 million worth of land to generate additional dollars. In March, DEP scrapped the program without selling an acre. Scott has proposed $70 million for next year -- that includes $40 million from the sale of non-conservation lands. Frank Jackalone, Sierra Club’s Senior Organizing Manager in Florida, said Scott’s claim is ""disconcerting"" because of the various cuts. ""You have to take all that into account when you run budget numbers,"" he said. ""It sounds to me like Scott’s people are coming up with their own selective set of budget figures. ... He doesn’t have environmental creds as far as I am concerned."" Our ruling During his State of the State speech Scott said, ""We have invested record funding in protecting our environment."" After the speech, a Scott spokesman said he was referring to money directed toward springs restoration. Scott’s statement during the speech likely left  listeners with the impression that his investment in the environment in general is a record, and that would be misleading. Sorting out the total investment in environmental protection under Scott compared to predecessors is complicated because funding comes from state and federal sources and multiple state programs relate to the environment. However, under one way to compare funding - - the total for the Department of Environmental Protection -- Scott falls far short of Bush’s record. And Scott doesn’t beat Crist’s record, either. Scott tried to take his spending recommendation for one particular environmental project -- springs restoration -- and portray that as an overall record, and that’s not the case",False,"March 6, 2014"
"Says ""Bill Clinton and George Bush both say build the Keystone XL.""","March 7 is the last day the U.S. Department of State will hear public comments on Keystone XL, a proposed pipeline that would carry diluted oil sands from Western Canada to Nebraska and then to refineries on the Gulf Coast. With the closing of the 30-day comment period, six years of contentious debate between environmentalists and pipeline supporters is expected to come to a head when President Barack Obama makes a final decision on whether to proceed. In an attempt to sway public opinion, the American Petroleum Institute relaunched an ad campaign backing the pipeline. The 30-second spot, which is airing in the District of Columbia, Montana, New Mexico and North Carolina, claims that in the land of deadlock, the pipeline is one of few projects to win support from both sides of the spectrum. ""Washington. It’s gridlock, division, bitter partisanship,"" the ad says. ""But one jobs plan brings both sides together. Bill Clinton and George (W.) Bush both say build the Keystone XL."" A ringing endorsement of the Keystone pipeline from 42 and 43? That sounds like something worth looking into. Bush backs it The American Petroleum Institute ad clearly identifies sources backing up their claim for viewers. For Bush, the ad references an article from Bloomberg published in March 2012, in which the former Republican president calls the pipeline ""a no-brainer,"" according to the report. ""The clear goal ought to be how to get the private sector to grow,"" Bush said. ""If you say that, then an issue like the Keystone pipeline becomes an easy issue."" We weren’t surprised Bush supports the plan. Republicans have been overwhelmingly supportive of the proposal and Bush has ties to the oil industry. Heck, he made the aforementioned remarks during the keynote speech of the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers conference. But what about Clinton? Clinton’s backing of Keystone did cause us to raise an eyebrow. The ad points to a Feb. 29, 2012, article from Politico. In it, Clinton calls for Americans to ""embrace"" the pipeline. We tracked down the original speech. It was given at the 2012 ARPA-E Energy Innovation Summit, a conference held by the U.S. Department of Energy. Here’s what Clinton had to say: ""One of the most amazing things to me about this Keystone Pipeline deal is that they ever filed that route in the first place since they could've gone around the Nebraska Sandhills and avoided most of the danger, no matter how imagined, to the Ogallala (aquifer) with a different route, which I presume we'll get now, because the extra cost of running it is infinitesimal compared to the revenues that will be generated over a long period of time. ""So, I think we should embrace it and develop a stakeholder-driven system of high standards for doing the work modeled on what was done with auto mileage agreement."" Clinton’s remarks are somewhat hard to follow. But he seems to say that Americans should ""embrace"" the Keystone pipeline and the government should work with the oil industry and environmentalists to develop standards for implementing and overseeing the project, similar to how all the stakeholders got together to develop higher standards for gas mileage in new vehicles. That’s how media reports characterized his comments, and Clinton made no attempt to correct them in the two years since. Within a year, Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman approved a new route for the pipeline that largely avoided the Nebraska Sandhills, as Clinton predicted. If he was not placated by the route change, Clinton never said so publicly. In fact, we couldn’t find any more public statements by Clinton regarding the Keystone XL pipeline. Several environmental groups we contacted said they had no recollection of Clinton speaking on the issue since 2012. We reached out to Clinton through the Clinton Global Initiative to see if his position had changed or could be affirmed for us. We didn’t hear back. Putting Clinton’s speech in context So we’re left with one public comment made two years ago. But we can deduce a few things based off what he said. First, in his remarks, Clinton was largely endorsing an all-of-the-above energy approach that focused on greener and sustainable methods. And while he expressed support for the Keystone project, he also said that tapping into homegrown natural resources was not a panacea. ""There are some hazards to the innovation project, right now,"" Clinton said. ""We have massive new recovery technologies in oil and gas which could lead us down the primrose path of thinking we don't have to keep using less energy and developing clean energy and technologies."" But Clinton’s call to ""embrace"" the pipeline also came as the U.S. State Department was deciding whether to recommend the project’s approval. The State Department, at that time, was headed by his wife. Indeed, not hours after Clinton gave his speech in 2012, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was testifying before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, where she fielded questions about the State Department’s oversight of the pipeline proposal. In the hearing, Secretary Clinton was even asked about her husband’s comments from earlier that day. Rep. Connie Mack, R-Fla., noted, ""Even the former President, Bill Clinton, says, ‘Embrace it and we need to move forward with the Keystone XL pipeline.’ "" Clinton respond, ""He is a very smart man,"" inciting laughter. She then added, ""But unfortunately he is not bound by the laws and regulations and longer of the United States to make decisions that follow a certain procedure. And that is what we have to do."" ""So is it a mistake for the former president to say, ‘embrace it’?"" Mack then asked. ""Of course not,"" Clinton replied. ""This is America. People say they embrace it, people say they hate it. Our job is to take a very clear-eyed look at what the facts are."" So not only did Bill Clinton come out in favor of the pipeline in 2012, he did so during a public speech hosted by the U.S. Energy Department just hours before his wife, who oversaw the administration’s review of the pipeline, was set to testify in front of a Republican-controlled House committee. For her part, Hillary Clinton has gone back and forth on the pipeline. In 2010 she said she was ""inclined"" to approve the project. But under her command, the State Department also recommended Obama deny approval of the pipeline in 2012 after congressional Republicans forced a decision from the White House within 60 days. At the time, Clinton said the window was too short to review the environmental impact of the project. Our ruling The American Petroleum Institute ad says, ""Bill Clinton and George Bush both say build the Keystone XL"" pipeline. While their evidence is two years old, it’s not fabricated. Since voicing support of the pipeline in 2012, Clinton has not publicly weighed in on the controversy. But his backing of the project was not an offhand comment. It came during a publicized energy speech on the same day his wife was testifying before Congress. It seems unlikely he would endorse the proposal on such an occasion if he did not mean it",True,"March 5, 2014"
"Says Alaska Sen. Mark Begich ""is on record supporting a carbon tax, even pushing Harry Reid to make it a priority.""","Conservative political advocacy group Americans For Prosperity is spending $400,000 into a TV ad attacking U.S. Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, for his position on a potential carbon tax. ""Sen. Begich hasn’t always been straight with us,"" the narrator claims as footage of him supporting Obamacare flashes across the screen. ""And now he’s at it again. Begich is on record supporting a carbon tax, even pushing Harry Reid to make it a priority."" PolitiFact wanted to find out if the ad accurately reflects Begich’s position on the carbon tax. A carbon tax would impose a tax or fee on oil, gas and coal usage. The idea is that by making natural resources costlier for individuals and businesses to use, a carbon tax would encourage the use of alternative energy sources. Most economists agree that a carbon tax would be effective, but the issue hasn’t gained much political traction. Because Congress hasn’t come close to passing such a tax, many of the logistics are still up in the air. How Begich has voted Americans For Prosperity pointed us to a couple of amendments to Senate budget resolutions from 2013 as examples of Begich supporting a carbon tax. Begich voted in favor of an amendment to last year’s budget resolution put forth by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., who has expressed support for implementing a carbon tax. That amendment failed, but it would’ve called for revenue generated by a carbon tax to be given back to the public in some form. Nothing in that amendment would actually enact a carbon tax. Rather, the amendment offered a rough framework for how money generated from such a tax, if one were enacted, would be put to use. ""I think that ultimately a fee on carbon pollution is inevitable, and the purpose of that amendment was to begin a discussion on that and begin the discussion about when that happens, what the best way to use the proceeds of the fee are,"" Whitehouse told reporters in September. ""So from that point of view, I didn’t view it as binding anybody on a carbon fee, but I did view it as an assessment of the best way of using carbon fee proceeds."" So although Begich’s vote wasn’t directly in support of a carbon tax, he was allying himself with a carbon tax supporter’s amendment that could make such a tax more politically palatable. The other vote Americans For Prosperity cited is from an amendment proposed by Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., which also failed. This amendment would have increased the threshold for passing a carbon tax framework within the budget resolution to 60 votes. Begich voted against this amendment, even as some of his Democratic colleagues from energy producing states voted for it. Still, by voting against this, he wasn’t directly expressing support for a carbon tax. Begich’s letter to Reid As for ""pushing Harry Reid to make it a priority,"" Americans For Prosperity pointed to a letter Begich and other Democratic senators wrote to Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., in 2010. Generally speaking, the letter calls for reform to U.S. energy policy to encourage clean energy: ""While fossil fuels are and will continue to be an important part of our economy, we believe the transition to a clean energy economy -- one that includes an all-of-the-above approach -- is an economic, national security and environmental priority."" The term ""carbon tax"" doesn’t appear in the letter. However, Americans for Prosperity zeroed in on the following line: ""We believe the scale of this challenge dictates the need for a comprehensive solution that includes making polluters pay through a price on greenhouse gas emissions."" A carbon tax could be one way to levy ""a price on greenhouse gas emissions."" Another way, though, would be through a cap-and-trade program. Begich’s campaign spokesman told PolitiFact that the letter he signed was meant to further a general conversation about climate change. The Hill reported that Begich has ""expressed skepticism"" about a carbon tax without expressing either explicit support or opposition. Begich acknowledges climate change in general is real and should be addressed by Congress. We’ve also noted that he sometimes breaks with the White House when it comes to taxes on the oil and gas industry. His campaign office put it this way to PolitiFact: ""Begich has not supported a carbon tax in the past."" Our ruling Americans for Prosperity said ""Begich is on record supporting a carbon tax, even pushing Harry Reid to make it a priority."" Begich voted on an amendment that said if there is a carbon tax, the revenue generated by a carbon tax to be given back to the public in some form.The letter to Reid said that energy policy should be aimed at putting some sort of price on greenhouse gas emissions, without specifically saying it should be a carbon tax. Begich’s campaign said he’s never explicitly supported a carbon tax. If you were counting votes in the U.S. Senate for a straightforward carbon tax and looked at Begich's record for how he might vote, you'd likely put Begich in the ""maybe"" column. Americans for Prosperity exaggerated in saying that Begich is ""on record"" supporting a carbon tax",Mostly False,"February 25, 2014"
"""Oregon and the federal government now have more than one million acres of burnt land and millions of trees are being left to rot.""","The timber wars of the 1980s and the lawsuits they spawned brought logging on Oregon’s public lands almost to a halt. Even now, annual timber harvests are a fraction of what they were several decades ago. The issue of how much timber should be cut has flared up again as Congress wrestles with a plan, unveiled by U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., that could double harvests on more than 2 million acres of federal forests across western Oregon. The Claim Medford businessman Gordon Challstrom, a Republican gubernatorial candidate, wants harvest levels far higher than they are now. In a recent website statement, Challstrom wrote, ""Oregon and the federal government now have more than one million acres of burnt land and millions of trees being left to rot."" One million acres of burnt land? Millions of trees left to rot? We took a look. The Analysis We called Challstrom and asked how he arrived at his figures. He directed us to an online map managed by the Northwest Interagency Coordination Center that lets people click on areas that have burned in recent years. A box pops up displaying the name of the fire, when it started and how many acres it consumed. Although Challstrom’s claim included no time frame, he told us he arrived at his figure by adding acreage totals of fires larger than 10,000 acres. Going back as far as initial salvage efforts in the wake of the giant Southern Oregon Biscuit Fire in 2002, he came up with 2.7 million acres. Since 51 percent of Oregon’s land is owned by the federal government, he said, he applied that to the 2.7 million acre number and ended up with the 1.4 million acres he’s characterizing as ""burnt land."" (The Congressional Research Service puts federal ownership of lands in the state at 53 percent.) Here’s how Challstrom got to his final 1 million figure: ""I tried to be fair,"" he said. ""I gave them the benefit of the doubt that they’ve logged on 400,000 acres, but I really doubt it."" The assertion that ""millions of trees"" are being left to rot on that acreage, he added, ""only stands to reason."" We added up totals from the interactive map and arrived at about the same 2.7 million acre figure Challstrom did. But we had questions about the way he came up with his 1 million acre total for ""burnt land."" We called Isaiah Hirschfield, intelligence officer at the interagency coordination center, which tracks long-term fire information. He said Challstrom’s methodology assumed that fires would break out evenly across the state, thus allowing him to come up with his 1 million acre figure by dividing total lands burned by the acreage owned by the federal government. ""That’s not an effective way to come up with that calculation,"" he said. Even so, Hirschfield added, Challstrom’s figure turns out to be in the ballpark. Citing agency statistics, he said an average of 250,000 acres have burned each year going back a decade. ""Cumulatively,"" he said, ""that’s 2.5 million acres, so he’s still pretty close."" Hirschfield pointed out an important caveat -- a portion of those burns, including a couple very big ones, were on both publicly and privately owned rangeland east of the Cascades. So while those blazes charred a lot of grass, they didn’t touch many trees. Challstrom’s claim did say ""more than"" one million acres. And while areas that burned a decade ago are more than likely covered with new vegetation by now, according to experts we talked to, it’s still true that more than one million acres of land burned in Oregon during the combined 2012 and 2013 fire seasons, according to U.S. Forest Service statistics. Verifying the second part of the claim -- the ""millions of trees left to rot"" -- is more difficult. For additional perspective, we called Paul Barnum, executive director of the Oregon Forest Resources Institute, an agency established by the Oregon Legislature in 1991 to gather and provide information about forest management. Forests west of the Cascades average 200 to 400 trees per acre, he said, while their eastside counterparts have sometimes ended up crammed with as many as 4,000. That occurred, he said, because of historic fire-suppression efforts. Some forests are so overgrown that a spark can result in a catastrophic wildlife. ""What’s true is that there never should have been that much biomass per acre in eastern Oregon,"" Barnum said. ""With that noted, it could very well be true that there are millions of trees left in those areas. But without walking every acre, there is really no way of verifying that."" John Bailey, silviculture and fire professor in Oregon State University’s College of Forestry, agreed. ""This would be nearly impossible to check,"" he wrote in an email. ""This analysis has been done for a few individual fires such as the much studied 2002 Biscuit Fire in southwest Oregon, but I don’t know anyone who has consolidated this data for all fires in the past decade."" To arrive at a reasonable estimate, you would need to know not only the number of acres burned in each fire, but also how many trees per acre there were, what percent were killed in the fire and how much salvage logging was done, according to Bailey. The Ruling Challstrom, as part of his 2014 gubernatorial campaign, said Oregon, as a result of forest fires, has ""more than one million acres of burnt land and millions of trees left to rot."" The first part of the claim is easily verified by simply adding up total acres burned in forest fires over the past decade or so. The second part, according to two forestry experts, is impossible to pin down. As for Challstrom’s claim, part of it is accurate, even if he used some faulty analysis to arrive at it. The second part is nearly impossible to verify but, according to one expert ""could very well be true",Half True,"February 21, 2014"
"""When the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport needed to stop its earthquake spike a few years ago, they temporarily shut down the wells that were injecting fracking fluid into the ground ... (and) those earthquakes stopped.""","If couples in Central Oklahoma felt the earth move on Valentine’s Day, it might not have been passion. Five earthquakes hit the area last Friday, followed by a sixth the next day. The quakes weren’t big. The strongest measured 3.5 on the Richter scale, but all of them were over the threshold to get residents’ attention. Rachel Maddow noticed as well. The MSNBC host linked the flurry of seismic activity to the region’s sizeable number of wells used to dispose of waste from oil and gas hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Oklahoma has about 6,000. There are many clustered in the county where the quakes took place. Maddow suggested that Central Oklahoma take a tip from Texas. ""When the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport needed to stop its earthquake spike a few years ago,"" Maddow said, ""they temporarily shut down the wells that were injecting fracking fluid into the ground at high pressure on the airport property, and lo and behold, those earthquakes stopped."" A reader asked us to see if that is true. We can report that it is. ""It’s an accurate assessment,"" said Dave Magana, the senior manager for public affairs at the airport. In fracking, operators pump water and chemicals into the ground to release oil and natural gas. When those fluids come back to the surface, the wastewater is moved to a disposal well where it is pumped back deep into the Earth. In 2008, the airport had leases with the Chesapeake Energy company for two such wells. One of them was near an old inactive fault line. The wells became active in September 2008 and the first earthquake came in October of that year. Brian Stump, a seismologist at Southern Methodist University, was part of a team that studied what was going on. ""Based on the timing and the location of the earthquakes, there was a plausible linkage,"" said Stump. Dallas-Fort Worth managers took Stump’s report to heart. ""The airport asked Chesapeake to close the well, and they did,"" Mangana said. The earthquakes stopped. The well in question has remained inactive, although a second well on airport land continues to operate. Fracking and its environmental impacts are a contentious issue. A study from the National Academy of Sciences did not find that getting natural gas this way led to ""induced seismic activity."" However, it did conclude that disposal of wastewater ""does pose some risks."" Our ruling Maddow said, ""When the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport needed to stop its earthquake spike a few years ago, they temporarily shut down the wells that were injecting fracking fluid into the ground ...

"As a result of climate change, ice fishermen in Wisconsin ""are already noticing fewer days they can be out on our ice covered lakes.""","Severe cold snaps followed by snowstorms and then another blast of cold. For many, this Wisconsin winter can’t end soon enough. So when U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, took to the floor of the House of Representatives on Jan. 16, 2014, a speech about global warming was the last thing many folks wanted to hear. Pocan, a member of the House’s Safe Climate Caucus, spent his one-minute speech ticking off what he said were clear signs of climate change. This claim caught our attention: ""Ice fishermen are already noticing fewer days they can be out on our ice covered lakes."" It feels like Wisconsin has been frozen solid for months, and many folks wouldn’t be surprised to see ice fishermen tromping around on Memorial Day. But Pocan’s claim is about more than this winter. His statement is about long-term trends and what is driving them. Is he right about climate change and fewer days on ice-covered lakes? When we asked Pocan for backup for the claim, his staff pointed us to Climatewisconsin.org, a web site that highlights research and reports prepared by environmental groups. The site includes interactive features that focus on the two largest lakes in Madison -- Mendota and Monona. It includes the amount of time they have been covered by ice in past years. ""The records show significant year-to-year variability in the length of the ice-cover season, but there is a clear trend of fewer ice-cover days over time,"" the site says. ""Overall, the average number of days of ice cover on the Madison lakes has decreased by around 29-35 days over the past 150 years. Significantly, the longest ice seasons on record are all clustered in the first few years of the record, while most of the shortest seasons fall towards the end of the record."" The site also includes this statement, which is pretty similar to that made by Pocan: ""With climate change models predicting warmer temperatures, we can expect to see a trend towards fewer days of ice-covered lakes as each year passes. In fact, with the aid of a remarkable dataset from Madison’s lakes, scientists infer that a change in ice duration has already taken place."" Information posted on the site comes, at least in part, from the work of John J. Magnuson, Emeritus Professor of Zoology and Limnology, who has been at UW since the late 1960s and helped found the UW-Madison Center for Limnology in the early 1980s. Limnology is the study of freshwater lakes, and the UW center says it’s the birthplace of the field of study, dating back to the 1870s. Magnuson is an expert on the effects of climate change on freshwater lakes, and has published numerous academic papers on the effect of climate change on lakes and fish. In an interview, Magnuson said researchers around the world, including Canada, Finland, Sweden, Russia, Japan and Madison, have studied lake ice for years. Researchers note the day lakes freeze and the day the ice goes out. It’s a more official version of what is waged in a less academic way by lakefront bars that stage ice-out guessing contests. Madison researchers have records for Mendota and Monona that go back to 1855. The long term trend for Lake Mendota is that, on average since 1855, there are 29 fewer days that the lake is covered with ice, according to Magnuson. Six of the shortest seasons for Mendota have been in the years since 1980. Five have been since 1995, including the two shortest seasons ever -- 21 days in the winter of 2001-02 and 47 days in 1997-98. Lake Monona has seen on average of 35 fewer ice-covered days, and also has seen a cluster of shorter seasons in recent years. ""The breakup of the ice is occurring, on average, two weeks earlier. And the freezing of the lakes have come two weeks later, on average,"" Magnuson said. ""The result is that four months of ice is reduced to about three months."" To be sure, Wisconsin has some 15,000 lakes, and we cannot check each one. ""This is highly variable with every water body having different characteristics, and is obviously very weather dependent as well,"" said Thomas Van Haren, of the state Department of Natural Resources Bureau of Law Enforcement. But it seems reasonable to focus on Lake Monona and Mendota given their size and because they are in Pocan’s district. So what about this throwback winter? Magnuson said it’s a statistical blip. Some years the ice stays around longer than others, but over time the trend has been toward shorter ice seasons. ""The variability is very high"" in terms of the length of the seasons, he said. ""Not only does lake ice respond to the warming climate, it also responds to local weather."" Lake Mendota iced over Dec. 16, 2013 -- about a month earlier than the previous year and four days earlier than the median date. Lake Monona froze Dec. 10, 2013, compared with Dec. 31 the previous year and a median date of Dec. 15. National Weather Service records from the weather office in Sullivan indicate this was the 9th coldest winter on record, so far, in Madison, and the coldest in 35 years. The average temperature was 15.8 degrees below normal. ""This is the sort of winter that’s typical of 50 or 100 years ago,"" Magnuson said. Going global So what about the connection Pocan made between shorter ice fishing seasons and climate change? Magnuson said the shorter seasons are a symptom of global warming -- one consistent with many others, such as changed bird and butterfly migration patterns, plants that bloom earlier, and disappearing glaciers. ""We can’t take this ice data and say ‘therefore we say greenhouse gas is causing this,’"" he said. ""That’s a question for the atmospheric physicists. Our data is consistent with what other people are finding, with the kind of things that atmospheric scientists are seeing from C02."" He added: ""There’s abundant evidence that it’s getting warmer and that spring is coming sooner."" Unfortunately, he’s talking about long-term trends. Not what is going to happen this year. Our rating It’s been a longer and colder winter than in recent years. But that doesn’t erase a trend that’s been well-established. The number of days that the lakes have ice on them -- making them safe for ice fishing -- has declined",True,"February 17, 2014"
"""The Republican leadership in the House has refused to address the issues that matter the most to Rhode Island, such as passing a jobs bill.""","In this era of high unemployment, it's always about jobs. The issue came up again Jan. 31 when Jonathan Boucher, executive director of the Rhode Island Democratic Party, published a commentary in The Providence Journal attacking the argument by Republican Ian Prior that the state needs Republicans in its congressional delegation, now all Democratic. Boucher argued that the idea of ""replacing our delegation with a bunch of Republican freshmen,"" which wasn't exactly Prior's argument, ""is completely absurd."" ""The House Republicans’ failure and inability to govern caused the first government shutdown in 16 years. The Republican leadership in the House has refused to address the issues that matter the most to Rhode Island, such as passing a jobs bill, extending unemployment benefits, raising the minimum wage, and passing comprehensive immigration reform."" In that list of alleged GOP failures, one stood out to a reader, who emailed us a list of jobs bills that, he said, the Republican-controlled House has, in fact, passed. We were intrigued and decided to see whether Boucher's jobs claim was correct. The list has lots of bills with the word ""jobs"" in the title, but that doesn't mean the proposals would actually create jobs. In addition, Republicans and Democrats tend to have different views on what constitutes a ""jobs bill."" For Democrats, that can mean legislation expanding or creating a government training program. For Republicans, that can mean bills shrinking government or eliminating regulations to help businesses. We decided to use a technique employed by PolitiFact National when it looked at a claim made on Facebook in 2011 that congressional Republicans have introduced dozens of bills on social issues and other topics, but ""zero on job creation,"" a claim that earned a Pants on Fire. We went to Congress.gov, run by the Library of Congress. It lists the topics that a bill covers. We looked for topics related to employment and job creation. It's not a perfect gauge, but it's a nonpartisan guide. We also reviewed summaries of the bills and committee reports looking for references to jobs and employment. For example, the SKILLS Act (H.R. 803), intended to streamline work-force development programs, touches on 52 topics from ""tobacco use"" to ""sex offenses."" But it also has provisions that deal with ""labor and employment,"" ""unemployment,"" ""temporary and part-time employment,"" ""vocational education"" and ""youth employment and child labor."" It passed the House on March 15, 2013. The ""Veterans Economic Opportunity Act of 2013"" (H.R. 2481) deals with veterans education, employment and rehabilitation. It passed the House on a voice vote on Oct. 28, 2013. And the ""Global Investment in American Jobs Act of 2013"" (H.R. 2052) is intended to get the feds to come up with a plan for increasing ""U.S. global competitiveness without weakening labor, consumer, financial, or environmental protections."" It passed the House in a bipartisan vote on Sept. 9, 2013. Some jobs bills were designed to create jobs by encouraging more energy production and distribution, such as proposals to expand offshore oil drilling or push the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which gives some environmentalists heartburn. Others on the list from our GOP reader seemed to have little to do with directly promoting employment, and Congress.gov doesn't list them in any employment-related categories. When we emailed the list of ""jobs"" legislation to Boucher, he took issue with some of the bills, saying they weren’t really about jobs. Boucher also argued that his statement is true because none of the Republican jobs-related legislation had been enacted. ""When I wrote 'passing a jobs bill,' I was clearly referring to a bill that has passed into law,"" he said in an email statement. ""A bill can’t create a single job if it’s not actually passed into law."" But that's not what he said in his commentary. He said, ""The Republican leadership in the House has refused to address the issues that matter the most to Rhode Island, such as passing a jobs bill."" The House, regardless of which party is in control, cannot unilaterally enact laws. Approval by the Senate and (in most cases) the president are also required. The bottom line: The House, under the current Republican leadership, has passed bills with the goal of encouraging employment. Whether one thinks that the bills will do more harm than good is a matter for debate, and beyond the scope of this fact check",False,"February 16, 2014"
"""Over 3 million Americans are employed in the growing green-collar workforce,"" which is more than the number ""of people working in the fossil fuel industry.""","The notion of counting the number of ""green"" jobs in America made us think, oddly enough, of a middle-age guy trying for cool by pairing a sport coat with blue jeans. Not easy. Yet quite matter-of-factly, while touting a clean energy jobs bill she introduced, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin made the following statement Jan. 22, 2014: ""Over 3 million Americans are employed in the growing green-collar workforce, including in clean energy and sustainability, which is more than the amount of people working in the fossil fuel industry."" When we put the Wisconsin Democrat’s claim to Daniel Kish at the Institute for Energy Research, he told us that both green and fossil fuel industry job numbers are sometimes thrown around with abandon.  ""This gets really dicey real quick,"" he said. ""Everybody’s got their dueling banjos.""  That’s PolitiFact Wisconsin’s kind of music.  Baldwin’s evidence To back his boss’ claim, Baldwin spokesman John Kraus cited two reports. Both are from solid sources, though they mix sports coats and -- er, apples and oranges -- a bit. 1. Federal report In 2012, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics embarked on an annual tally of green jobs. The agency had the advantage of considering a definition of green jobs proffered a year earlier by the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C. think tank, which produced its own green jobs count. The Bureau of Labor Statistics surveyed 120,000 business and government establishments within 325 industries that were ""identified as potentially producing green goods or providing green services."" Those surveyed said whether they produced green goods and services and the percentage of their revenue or employment associated with that output.  Green goods and services were defined as those that ""benefit the environment or conserve natural resources."" They fall into one or more of the following five groups:  1) Production   of  energy  from  renewable  sources; 2) energy efficiency; 3) pollution reduction and removal, greenhouse  gas reduction,  and  recycling  and  reuse;  4) natural   resources conservation;  and  5) environmental compliance,  education  and training, and public awareness. So, the list of green jobs is quite varied, including jobs in areas such as farming; home construction; electric, solar and other types of power generation; petroleum and coal products manufacturing; urban mass transit; newspaper publishing; advertising and public relations services; waste treatment and disposal; museums and zoos; and social advocacy organizations.
 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics produced its second -- and, it turns out, final -- green jobs report in March 2013. It estimated that ""employment associated with the production of green goods and services"" -- full- and part-time jobs -- exceeded 3.4 million in 2011. Manufacturing, with 507,000 green jobs, was the largest sector. Goods produced by those jobs included air conditioning and refrigeration equipment meeting selected standards, hybrid cars and parts, and pollution mitigation equipment. Kish, who is senior vice president for policy at the industry-backed Institute for Energy Research, pointed out that 886,000 of the 3.4 million were government jobs -- not jobs, he said, in which people are ""making or installing windmills and solar panels.""  ""Green,"" Kish said, is a ""political word, used by politicians and advocates, that is truly elusive."" Nevertheless, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is well-established as the official jobs counter for the federal government.  The 2013 report, for the number of green jobs in 2011, remains the latest available. That report said that because of budget cuts, no more green counts would be done.  2. Think tank study The Brookings Institution report we noted above was produced in 2011, so it’s a little dated.  Brookings estimated that in 2010, there were 2.7 million green jobs -- that is, jobs that ""directly contributed to the production of goods and services that had an environmental beneﬁt.""  Brookings didn’t do a count of fossil fuel industry jobs, but it did make a comparison using federal government tallies. Its report said that in 2010, there were 1.3 million jobs that directly supported ""the production of fossil fuel-based energy, derivative manufactured products and machinery.""  If all wholesale and retail distributors, transporters and other workers -- such as gas station employees -- were included, the fossil fuel tally would be 2.4 million jobs, Brookings said. Brookings scholar Jonathan Rothwell told us some critics view the think tank’s definition of green jobs as too expansive. For example, some 350,000 public transportation jobs in the green tally include not only bus drivers but secretaries, janitors, executives and all other employees who work for bus companies, he said.  Brookings' definition of green jobs ""was very broad and included any economic activity that has an environmental benefit -- from public transportation to waste management,"" Rothwell acknowledged, adding that because ""only a small portion of energy comes from green sources, fossil fuel employees are a much larger share of the energy sector's workforce."" But Rothwell noted that the Bureau of Labor Statistics adopted a similar definition when it did green jobs counts. And we note that BLS arrived at a roughly similar green jobs estimate. So, the most recent federal report backs the first part of Baldwin’s statement, that there are more than 3 million green jobs.  The older think tank report she cites doesn’t say there were more than 3 million green jobs, but does say that green jobs outnumbered fossil fuel industry jobs as of 2010. Other views One thing to underline here is that counting green jobs is a different sort of animal.  As CNN/Money observed when the first Bureau of Labor Statistics green jobs report came out in 2012, comparing ""green jobs to another singular sector isn't really fair. The green jobs survey took into account a wide variety of jobs in over 300 different industries."" As for the oil and gas industry itself, a July 2013 report was done by PricewaterhouseCoopers for the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association for the oil and natural gas industry, that was an update of a report done two years earlier.  The later report said there were 2.59 million jobs in the oil and natural gas industry in 2011. PricewaterhouseCoopers said it utilized data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the U.S. Census Bureau for its study. The study noted that the oil and natural gas industry ""encompasses a number of activities that span separate industry classifications in government economic data."" For example, oil and natural gas exploration and production is included in the mining sector; and oil refining is part of the manufacturing sector. The study defined the oil and gas industry to include all such activities.  The petroleum institute noted to us criticism of how the federal government defines green jobs, including an editorial in Investor’s Business Daily that called the annual count ""phony."" A final note:  In November 2012, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, made a claim similar to but more broad than Baldwin’s, saying there were ""more people working in clean and green energy than in oil and gas in this country.""  That was before the latest reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and American Petroleum Institute that estimated green and fossil fuel jobs for 2011",True,"February 14, 2014"
"""Large parts of Florida"" have experienced ""years of below average rainfall.""","Florida may be the Sunshine State, but what really sets it apart is its water -- where it comes from, how much there is and who uses it. Lawmakers are paying more attention to water policies in an election year. That means the business-backed lobbying group Associated Industries of Florida is also announcing a new group to help the state make decisions about water quality and quantity. In a Feb. 6 press release, AIF announced the H20 Coalition, a group described only as ""stakeholders"" who plan to help mold legislation for water laws. The group points out some reasons for this marked interest. ""Years of below average rainfall in large parts of Florida combined with reduced infrastructure spending during the recession, have exacerbated a growing shortfall in water supply across the state, drawing the attention of Florida's businesses, environmental groups, utilities and government,"" the release said. It seems like there’s been a lot of rain across the state lately. Is it true swaths of Florida have been experiencing a persistent lack of rain over the years? We decided to examine the rain gauges and find out. Rain check The state’s main groundwater supply is the Floridan Aquifer, which also supplies parts of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina. The aquifer’s network loses water as it is pumped out of the ground through wells or city water systems, and relies on rainfall to recharge water levels. Andy O’Reilly, a hydrologist with the U.S. Geologic Survey’s Florida Water Science Center in Orlando, says that across the state, anywhere from less than one to 25 or more inches of annual rainfall has the potential to soak into the aquifer, depending on the local geology. Even much of that ends up as runoff in rivers and streams. The rest of the precipitation either evaporates or is used by plants for transpiration. ""Rainfall is the biggest component in maintaining the aquifer on a regional level,"" he said, noting that the Floridan Aquifer is particularly sensitive to precipitation levels -- and from overpumping by homes and industries during dry spells.  So the first thing we did was look into statewide rainfall totals. Checking in with the Florida Climate Center provided a quick look at statewide totals over the years. Over the last 30 years, Florida has averaged a little more than 54 inches of rain per year, among the highest in the country. Going back to 2000, an extremely dry year, there have been five years of below-average rainfall statewide (2012 was the most recent complete year available): Yr ‘00 ‘01 ‘02 ‘03 ‘04 ‘05 ‘06 ‘07 ‘08 ‘09 ‘10 ‘11 ‘12 Avg 43.2 54.5 59.4 61.1 59.2 62.7 42.6 45.2 55.1 56.0 49.1 48.9 55.5   So, five out of 13 years were below average, which is about 40 percent. We checked the state’s five water management districts, designed to tend to water resources across Florida. AIF said that ""large parts"" of Florida had below average rainfail, so numbers by district give us a sense of how rainfall measures up on a regional basis. For instance, the Southwest Florida Water Management District, which extends from parts of Marion County down to Sarasota County, has a 30-year rainfall average of 51.2 inches. For that district, rainfall totals were: Yr ‘00 ‘01 ‘02 ‘03 ‘04 ‘05 ‘06 ‘07 ‘08 ‘09 ‘10 ‘11 ‘12 Avg 37.8 45.6 56.9 65.9 62.9 55.1 45.8 39.5 50.7 47.5 53.3 46.6 51.1   So there were six years out of 13 that were below the regional average, which is about 46 percent. The South Florida Water Management District, covering the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Palm Beach metroplex over to Fort Myers and Naples, extending north of Lake Okeechobee into Orlando, has a 30-year average of 51.4 inches. Its rainfall totals were: Yr ‘00 ‘01 ‘02 ‘03 ‘04 ‘05 ‘06 ‘07 ‘08 ‘09 ‘10 ‘11 ‘12 Avg 39.4 53.2 54.3 53.3 48.4 60.0 40.7 42.8 53.3 48.4 48.9 49.3 52.2   There are seven years below that average since 2000, or about 54 percent. The data is broken down different ways in different districts, but all of them give you a decent idea of which parts of the state are experiencing less rainfall than usual. In the Northwest Florida Water Management District, covering the Panhandle from Escambia County to the western half of Jefferson County, district-wide data isn’t kept, but rather organized by cities where rainfall totals are measured. In Panama City, for example, the 30-year rainfall average is 61 inches. They’re an example of a location being hit by some below average years lately: Yr ‘00 ‘01 ‘02 ‘03 ‘04 ‘05 ‘06 ‘07 ‘08 ‘09 ‘10 ‘11 ‘12 Avg 41.2 50.4 49.0 64.7 46.3 52.6 42.5 35.8 57.8 53.6 48.7 38.7 65.8   That means 11 years between 2000-12 had below average rainfall, or 85 percent. What the climatologists say But do these numbers mean there’s a shortage of rainfall in the state? Climatologist David Zierden with the Florida Climate Center says no. While it’s true there have been some drier years than normal in the past decade or so, there have been plenty of wetter than average years, too. He said 2013 was the 14th or 15th rainiest year on record since 1895. Tracking average rainfall means ""there will be some winners and some losers,"" Zierden said. Sometimes the totals are above the average, and sometimes they’re below, which is the nature of Florida’s rainfall. This is a pattern that repeats across the state’s climate zones. He added the state has been in and out of drought over the last decade, but recent years are no worse than 2000 and 2001, which coincided with three dry years of La Nina conditions. ""Here in Florida we’re really dominated by year-to-year totals,"" he said. ""There’s no statistically significant trend at work here."" Those rainfall variances, as inconsistent as they may be, still mean parts of the state have had dry years, and hydrologist O’Reilly said they still could affect the aquifer. That’s because the recharge rate is not a direct ratio to the rainfall total; for example, a 20 percent decrease in rainfall could mean quite a bit more than a 20 percent decrease in the recharge rate. Overall, the accumulated effects of rainfall deficits and surpluses combine with the rate at which people pump water out of the aquifer to affect the water supply’s long-term balance, he said. The AIF press release doesn’t mention overpumping from the aquifer as part of the problem maintaining the water supply, but some experts say that would be the real driver of any shortfalls. And commercial interests, especially agriculture, are responsible for most of that overpumping during dry periods. Tom Swihart, the former head of the Office of Water Policy in the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, says not only are estimates of future water supply shortfalls historically too high, but currently funded water projects all but meet those goals. Water usage by residents is on a downward trend as well, not just in Florida, but nationwide. But even keeping that in mind, ensuring quality should take precedent over quantity, Swihart said. ""All of this concern about water supply deflects attention from the much more serious problem of excessive nutrients in Florida waters,"" he said, referring to the proliferation of fertilizers, pesticides and dangerous chemicals in the water supply from the industries for which AIF lobbies. ""That truly is a statewide issue and needs urgent attention."" Our ruling The Associated Industries of Florida said in its press release that ""large parts of Florida"" have experienced ""years of below average rainfall."" While parts of Florida have had below-average rainfall, we also saw years of above-average rainfall. Climatologists told us the state overall is doing fine, thanks to the years when it was above average. Most recently, 2013 was the 14th or 15th rainiest year on record since 1895. While the record on rainfall is mixed, there are other issues that affect water levels in the aquifer. Overpumping for residential and commercial uses, especially during dry spells, has a lot to do with the dwindling water supply as well, but AIF, which lobbies for business interests that pump from the aquifer, makes no mention of that. The claim is partially accurate, but leaves out important details",Half True,"February 13, 2014"
"A government report shows that alternatives to the Keystone XL pipeline ""are worse"" for the environment.","Republicans are rejoicing over a new government report about one of the biggest controversies of the day. Nope, not Obamacare, but good guess. It’s on the Keystone XL pipeline. As liberal CNN Crossfire host Van Jones argued against President Barack Obama approving the project in a recent show, conservative activist Ralph Reed said a U.S. State Department study clears the air about the project’s long-term effect on the environment. (We rated Jones’ statement about the project creating 35 permanent jobs True.) ""What the report shows, Van -- and this is irrefutable; the science is clear -- is that the alternatives to the pipeline are worse,"" he said. ""If you use primarily tanker trucks to transport this shale gas, climate emissions will be 28 percent higher than the pipeline. If you use primarily rail, they'll be 40 to 42 percent higher."" ""So if you're protecting the environment, you should build the pipeline."" We wanted to check out his claim that the pipeline is better in terms of fewer climate emissions than the alternatives, including doing nothing. Read this if you’re kind of late to Keystone  The proposed Keystone XL pipeline would stretch from Western Canada to Steele City, Neb., ushering 830,000 barrels of heavy, diluted Canadian tar sands per day to refineries on the Gulf Coast with help of existing pipelines. TransCanada’s project crosses international borders, so the company had to file an application for a presidential permit. As part of the process, the president directs the Secretary of State to determine whether the project ""serves the national interest."" Secretary of State John Kerry has not yet issued his recommendation. The issue splits environmentalists and labor unions, putting Kerry and Obama under unusual pressure from a divided Democratic Party. Republicans and labor unions tout the pipeline’s construction jobs, reduced dependence on oil from other continents and continued friendliness with Canada, while environmentalists want Obama to send a strong message about climate change. Back in June, Obama said the country’s national interest ""will be served only if this project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution."" Many headlines about an 11-volume State Department report about the pipeline’s environmental impact focused on its finding that the pipeline project would not significantly contribute to carbon pollution, which some see as giving Obama an opening for approval. That does not mean the project is without impact. The report examined the greenhouse gas effect of the project, finding that the emissions primarily from electricity use to power pump stations, fuel for vehicles and vented or leaked methane would be comparable to about 300,000 cars operating per year, or more than 70,000 homes using electricity for one year. An important thread in the debate is an assurance from Canadian officials and oil producers that oil will reach the American marketplace even if the pipeline is not built. So the State Department compared the environmental impact of other methods of moving the oil south from Canada. What could happen without the pipeline?  Producing crude oil from oil sands is complicated. The sands are comprised of clay, sand, water and a substance called bitumen, a thick, soft asphalt-like material that is too dense to traverse pipelines on its own. It is diluted with lighter substances and heated to make it easier to move, resembling more of a heavy crude oil called dilbut. The process is energy-intensive, and the transportable material is corrosive and difficult to clean up, opponents say. By law, the department had to consider the environmental impact of reasonable alternatives to the pipeline. The State Department investigated three alternative transportation methods: If you had a hard time visualizing how all of that would work, consult the State Department’s map laying it out (or read the 100-page description). Our focus is on how these alternatives affect carbon emissions. We modified a chart in the State Department report for annual greenhouse gas emissions from crude transport from Alberta, Canada, to the Gulf Coast. (MTCO2e = Metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents) Proposed Keystone XL pipeline Rail/pipeline scenario Rail/tanker scenario All rail to coast scenario MTCO2e/Year per 830,000 barrels per day 3,123,859 4,428,902 4,363,611 3,991,472 MTCO2e/Year per 100,000 barrels per day 376,369 533,603 525,857 480,900 Percentage difference from proposed Keystone n/a 41.8 percent 39.7 percent 27.8 percent   Reed’s numbers for carbon emissions from the alternative scenarios pretty much align with the report, but he mixed them up. He said, ""If you use primarily tanker trucks to transport this shale gas, climate emissions will be 28 percent higher than the pipeline. If you use primarily rail, they'll be 40 to 42 percent higher."" In reality, using primarily rail raises carbon levels 28 percent more than the pipeline and using primarily tankers raises carbon levels 40 percent, the report said. Reed also said tanker trucks, when the report is actually speaking of tanker ships. Using a combination of rail and existing pipeline would yield 42 percent more carbon emissions. Not exactly a clean bill of health Reed is broadly onto something with the report, but environmental activists criticized his statement, saying the science on the climate safety of shale oil is hardly clear. Reed’s statement dismisses the fact that the project would generate more greenhouse gases than the alternative desired by environmentalists: doing nothing to expand tar sands production. ""It’s all worse"" for the environment than doing nothing, said Eddie Scher, a spokesman for the Sierra Club. ""The argument here is that crack is somehow worse than heroin. We think that you should do neither."" Extracting oil from tar sands is more ""carbon intensive"" than other crude oil. It’s 13 percent more carbon intensive than other heavy crudes and 17 percent more than the average barrel of crude oil refined in the U.S. in 2005. If Keystone XL is rejected, ""tar sands expansion will slow,"" said Anthony Swift, National Resources Defense Council international program attorney. Even the Environmental Protection Agency raised concerns with the State Department about the possibility of tar sands being easily shipped by rail instead of the pipeline. In April, the EPA argued in response to a State draft environmental assessment that the department should improve its energy-economic modeling strategy and dig in deeper to rail capacity and costs. Basically, their assumptions are too rosy, EPA says. Our ruling Reed said the State Department report shows ""the science is clear"" that ""alternatives to the pipeline are worse,"" pointing to higher emissions from alternate transportation options of tanker trucks and rail. Reed didn’t pull the numbers out of anywhere, although he did mess them up a bit, for instance by saying ""tanker trucks"" instead of sea ""tankers"" described in one of the report’s alternative scenarios. As to his general point that the pipeline option is better in terms of CO2 emissions than projections for other options, yes, those alternatives are worse. But besides getting his numbers crossed, he was also a bit clumsy in describing ""alternatives"" and saying that if ""you're protecting the environment, you should build the pipeline."" Reed assumes that the pipeline should be built, but environmentalists say the best alternative for the environment would be to do nothing and slow tar sands production. Reed’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context",Half True,"February 13, 2014"
"The Keystone pipeline creates ""35 permanent jobs"" after construction, according to a government report.","The debate over whether President Barack Obama should approve the Keystone XL pipeline often turns to jobs, but should it? Liberal CNN Crossfire host Van Jones says the pipeline is not the jobs creator supporters talk it up to be. ""Every time we have a show, somebody says something ... about Keystone, and somehow Keystone is going to create all these jobs,"" Jones said in the Feb. 3 episode of Crossfire. ""Then it turns out, look at the actual numbers. It turns out the actual numbers are 3,900 temporary jobs in the construction sector and 35 permanent jobs."" Ralph Reed, a conservative activist who founded the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said Jones’ claim is unfair because a long-anticipated report by the U.S. State Department says the project will create 42,000 jobs. Reed went on to say the report cleared the main argument against the project, that it’s bad for the environment. We are fact-checking claims from each pundit about the project. Here, we’ll focus on Jones’ claim about the project creating ""35 permanent jobs."" The proposed Keystone XL pipeline would stretch 875 miles from Western Canada to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with existing pipelines and usher up to 830,000 barrels of oil per day to refineries on the Gulf Coast. Because TransCanada’s project crosses international borders, the company had to file an application for a presidential permit. As part of the process, the president directs the Secretary of State to determine whether the project ""serves the national interest."" Secretary of State John Kerry has not yet issued a recommendation to Obama based on the study. Obama is under political pressure from all sides, with environmentalists and Democrats like Jones on one side who want him to shut it down and Republicans and some Democrats supportive of organized labor on the other who say it would strengthen the country’s energy independence and, yes, create jobs. When the State Department released its 11-volume report about the pipeline’s impact Jan. 31, 2014, the big headline in most news coverage centered on its finding that the pipeline project would not significantly contribute to carbon pollution. Some see that as giving Obama an opening for approval. With that backstory out of the way, let’s crack open the chapter on jobs. There’s plenty of debate over how many jobs the project would create during construction. The State Department report puts the total at 42,100 jobs, though the definition of a job in this sense is a position filled for one year. Much of the construction work would come in four- or or eight-month stretches. About 10,400 seasonal workers would be recruited for construction, the State Department said. When looked at as ""an average annual job,"" it works out to about 3,900 jobs over one year of construction or 1,950 jobs each year for two years. The rest of the jobs would be the result of spillover spending (formally called indirect or induced economic activity) as Keystone workers buy equipment and materials to complete the project and spend their money on an array of services, including food, health care, and arts and entertainment. As you might expect, it’s much harder to measure the widespread effect on job creation. There’s no doubting that most of the economic activity comes during construction. Jones honed in on jobs after construction, which aren’t really a source of sharp debate. ""There’s very few jobs operating pipelines,"" said Ian Goodman, president of the Goodman Group Ltd., an energy and economic consulting firm in Berkeley, Calif. ""That’s one of the reasons why pipelines are attractive to the oil industry. They’re relatively inexpensive to build and operate."" The report says the project would provide jobs for about 35 permanent employees and 15 temporary contractors. The full-timers would be ""required for annual operations, including routine inspections, maintenance and repair."" Some would work in Canada. The U.S. employees would work at pump stations along the pipeline route as well as a Nebraska office. The project’s impact on housing, property taxes and service industries once in operation? Not much. Not much is known about the contractors’ workload except they would provide additional specialized support. Still, arguments about the relatively small number of permanent jobs from the pipeline often belie the nature of construction jobs, which are comprised of temporary projects by definition, said Matt Dempsey, a spokesman for a coalition of pro-Keystone groups known as Oil Sands Fact Check. ""You build it, you move on,"" Dempsey said. Our ruling Jones said the Keystone pipeline will only result in 35 permanent jobs after construction. The numbers, as reported by the State Department, back him up, though that’s the nature of any big construction project, be it a highway or monument",True,"February 10, 2014"
"""Over the past eight years, the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth.""","In his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama boasted about progress on climate change, citing reductions in carbon emissions. ""Taken together, our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a cleaner, safer planet,"" he said. ""Over the past eight years, the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth. But we have to act with more urgency – because a changing climate is already harming western communities struggling with drought, and coastal cities dealing with floods."" We wondered whether Obama was correct that ""over the past eight years, the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth."" We turned to data from the Energy Information Administration, a trusted source for all types of energy data run by the U.S. Energy Department. The agency has a table showing ""total carbon dioxide emissions from the consumption of energy."" The data shows a mixed picture. Obama is correct if you measure the total reduction in carbon emissions. Between 2003 and 2011 -- the latest eight-year period for which data is available -- the United States’ carbon emissions fell from 5.853 billion metric tons to 5.490 billion metric tons. That’s a reduction of 363 million metric tons -- far larger than any other country. However, the statistic is not as enlightening as it would seem, because it fails to account for the relative size of countries.

A more useful comparison is to measure the percentage reduction for countries all around the world. We looked at the largest nations -- those with at least 100 million tons of carbon emissions in 2011 -- and found six other nations that managed to cut their carbon emissions more steeply than the United States did during the past eight years. They are: Greece: -15 percent Germany: -14 percent United Kingdom: - 13 percent Belgium: -13 percent France: -8 percent Spain: -8 percent United States: -6 percent To be fair, many nations increased their emissions over that period -- including such big economies as China, India and Russia -- and in this context, the scale of the United States’ cuts is impressive. Still, this suggests that a half-dozen advanced industrialized economies made emissions cuts that were larger, proportionately, than the United States achieved. Our ruling Obama said, ""Over the past eight years, the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth."" Looked at by the total amount of emission reductions, Obama is right. But when you look at the scale of the cuts proportionately -- which puts nations on a more equal footing when making comparisons -- the United States did not achieve the kind of steep cuts that other industrialized countries did",Half True,"January 28, 2014"
"""Recently, Florida has successfully reduced the environmental permitting time down to just two days.""","Gov. Rick Scott, who has drawn criticism from environmentalists for his strongly pro-business policies, this week called for an increase in spending for conservation projects on waterways and in the Everglades. At a Jan. 21, 2014, event in Tallahassee to honor 125 Department of Environmental Protection employees, Scott announced a budget request that includes efforts to protect and restore springs. He then made a statement praising the speed at which such employees work: ""Recently, Florida has successfully reduced the environmental permitting time down to just two days. That’s great."" In a press gaggle following the event, DEP Secretary Herschel Vinyard Jr. -- a Scott appointee -- was asked about that two-day timetable. He didn’t back up his boss: ""We're actually at about 32, 33 days is our average permit processing time. So I'm not exactly sure what was mentioned,"" Vinyard said. (Tampa Bay Times reporter Steve Bousquet was at the press gaggle and recorded the comments. We also confirmed Scott’s comments in his written prepared remarks.) Once we started digging, it became clear that Scott was talking about an entirely different type of permit. Let’s go deep into the weeds to discern the differences between these two types of permits. Permitting process at two state agencies There is a license that takes on average two days to obtain -- but it’s not an environmental permit. ""Under Gov. Scott’s administration, the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation has reduced professional license processing time by more than 60 percent from an average of six days to two days,"" said Scott spokeswoman Jackie Schutz in an email. Those professional licenses are for a range of jobs including auctioneers, hair braiders, geologists, realtors and veterinarians. For these permits, it now takes two days to process the application. In some instances, applicants have to complete other steps -- for example, to pass an exam or receive board certification, said Department of Business and Professional Regulation spokeswoman Tajiana Ancora-Brown. It takes longer to process an environmental permit, though the lag time has dropped. It took the Department of Environmental Protection 87.7 days in 2010-11 to produce permits. It’s now 33.7 days on average. This covers permits related to waste, water and air. Typically, the applicants seeking such permits are businesses, though on occasion, homeowners may apply, too. For instance, a resident who wants to build on a wetland on their property would have to file an application, said Patrick Gillespie, a spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection. Officials for both the Department of Business and Professional Regulation and the Department of Environmental Protection told us they had sped up the process in part by emphasizing online applications. At DEP, they also added a ""pre-application meeting"" for applicants to go over the regulations and reduce the chance their application would arrive incomplete. In 2012, Scott signed a bill that reduced the amount of time to approve certain permits -- for example wetlands permits -- from 90 days to 60 days, earning kudos from business groups. In December 2012, DEP employees who improved customer service including speeding up the permitting process received bonuses. But environmentalists have raised concerns. While the department found more than $500,000 for bonuses, it also laid off 58 employees. State Rep. Mark Pafford, D-West Palm Beach, told the Tampa Bay Times that the bonuses sent the wrong message to employees. ""You’re arguably providing an incentive to turn your head,"" Pafford said. ""You’re giving someone a bonus for them not to take the time required when reviewing permits. That’s dangerous for an agency called the Department of Environmental Protection."" Our ruling Scott said, ""Recently, Florida has successfully reduced the environmental permitting time down to just two days."" Scott was mistaken; he was actually referring to the amount of time it takes to get a professional license from the Department of Business and Professional Regulation. During Scott’s tenure, the state has reduced the amount of time it takes to get an environmental permit to about 34 days. However, what he said was incorrect",False,"January 27, 2014"
"Deer baiting, planned for Block Island by DEM, is illegal in Rhode Island.","Nothing gets under people's skin like the government engaging in activity that is illegal for everyone else, such as when Congress passes laws and then exempts itself from them. On Jan. 12, 2014, in a letter to The Providence Journal, Richard August, co-host of the WHJJ radio show ""Lock, Stock and Daria,"" asserted that the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management would be doing exactly that if it carries out its plan to hire professional hunters to cull the deer population on Block Island. According to the plan, the hunters would use feeding stations to lure the deer. ""Baiting deer happens to be illegal in Rhode Island,"" August wrote. ""But I guess if you are the state, the laws don’t apply."" We wondered what the law actually said. First, some background. Block Island, officially known as New Shoreham, is overrun by deer -- an estimated 800 to 1,000 on the 9.5-square mile island. The town and the DEM have agreed on a plan to hire a Connecticut firm to reduce the population to 150 or fewer over the next four years. Corn bait will be used to lure deer to 15 to 20 sites on the southwestern part of the island. Sharpshooters perched on raised platforms will shoot the deer. Their goal for this winter is to kill about 200, beginning in the last week of February. The carcasses will be carved into venison using a mobile meat processing service based in Maine. The meat will be offered first to Block Island residents; the rest will be distributed to the Rhode Island Community Food Bank and other hunger programs. Going back to August's claim, the ""Deer Hunting"" section of state law says the DEM can adopt rules and regulations on deer hunting in Rhode Island but, ""In any event, the following prohibitions and restrictions shall always apply to deer hunting:"" Paragraph 6 says, ""No person shall make, set, or use any trap or snare, or salt lick or other device for the purpose of ensnaring, enticing, taking, injuring, or killing a deer."" When we asked the DEM about this, the department released a statement through spokeswoman Gail Mastrati saying that the rule only applies to ""recreational hunting."" That's not what the DEM would be doing, she said. ""The bait and shoot deer reduction project on Block Island, authorized under emergency regulations filed by DEM on Nov. 7, 2013, to address a serious problem on the island, is not a recreational hunting activity,"" her statement said. ""A bait and shoot deer reduction effort is very different from recreational hunting. The knowledge of animal behavior and the discipline and skills in marksmanship are more sophisticated and strategic than those necessary to be a successful recreational deer hunter."" The ""deer hunting"" section of state law does not make any distinction between recreational and non-recreational hunting. We asked the DEM about that. The department responded in an email: ""Hunting regulations do not apply to the deer culling operation because it is not a hunting activity. Rather, it is a wildlife management action authorized under DEM's statutory authority."" We'll leave it up to others to debate whether the culling of the island’s deer herd is really a hunt and, if so, whether the state’s hunting laws should apply to the DEM. (We should note, for example, that most of us have no problem with agents of the state, such as police officers, ignoring traffic signals or speed limits when chasing criminals.) But when Richard August asserts that state law makes it illegal for hunters to use bait to lure deer, which is what the DEM plans to do when it stages a mass shooting of deer, he is correct",True,"January 26, 2014"
"""Most of West Virginia is still owned, in excess of 90 percent, by out-of-state interests.""","A January chemical spill in West Virginia that left 300,000 without tap water was just the most recent episode of contamination in a state that has suffered more than its share. Bob Kincaid, a liberal radio host and co-founder of Appalachian Community Health Emergency, said in West Virginia ""everything has been for sale to the highest bidder,"" with the toll taken out on the health of the people who live there. ""We have sacrificed everything in order to enhance those corporate profits for people who are outside this state,"" Kincaid said on MSNBC’s Melissa Harris-Perry. ""Let's understand that most of West Virginia is still owned, in excess of 90 percent, by out-of-state interests."" That number jumped out at us and when we got in touch with Kincaid, he was quick to say he had made a mistake. ""The number is lower,"" he said. But whatever the number, Kincaid said it wasn’t central to his point. ""The germane fact remains that 300,000 human beings are involuntarily participating in an unconscionable experiment on them, and that is a terrifying reality."" West Virginia has been rich in coal and timber and the trade-off of who benefits the most from mining and logging is a topic that has simmered for many decades in the state. A landmark 1974 study by a local investigative journalist found that absentee landlords owned or controlled two-thirds of the state’s private land. (That’s obviously well short of 90 percent.) In 2013, a follow-up report from the West Virginia Center for Budget and Policy, a group that focuses on the needs of the moderate and low-income people, and the American Friends Service Committee, found that the fraction of land concentrated in the hands of relatively few owners is much less today. The 10 largest landowners are all headquartered out of state and they hold title to about 12 percent of the state’s private acreage. Laying claim to what’s on the surface misses a big piece of West Virginia’s wealth picture. A huge sum of money lies in the mineral rights, mainly the coal and gas. Owning the land doesn’t necessarily mean you own what’s underneath it. But Ted Boettner, executive director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, is reluctant to make hard and fast claims as to who owns that part of the state. ""All you can say is that a large fraction of the mineral rights are held by out-of-state interests, but beyond that, we just don’t have the data,"" Boettner said. Our ruling Kincaid said during the broadcast that more than 90 percent of West Virginia is owned by out-of-state interests. He told us he realized his mistake after the show and apologized for his error. Kincaid gets credit for his readiness to correct his original statement, but we fact-check what he said on air.

"""Only 3 percent of voters 18 to 34 don't believe that climate change is really happening.""","More than a dozen Senate Democrats called a news conference on Jan. 14, 2014, to draw attention to their efforts to curb climate change. One of those senators -- Chris Murphy, D-Conn. -- focused his remarks on the impact of public opinion on advancing an agenda on climate-change policy. Murphy said that advocates for policies to address climate-change ""have to convince Republicans -- and those who would stand against the action that we're proposing -- of the electoral consequences of continuing to ignore this issue. We have to tell Republicans that if they ultimately want to stop the hemorrhaging from young voters in this country, they need to start paying attention to this issue, because only 3 percent of voters 18 to 34 don't believe that climate change is really happening."" We wondered whether Murphy’s polling data was sound. Thanks to some previous reporting by our colleagues at PolitiFact Rhode Island, we quickly found a poll that appears to be the source for Murphy’s claim. It was commissioned by the League of Conservation Voters, an environmental group, and conducted by a polling team that included one Democratic firm and one Republican firm. The poll was taken between July 8 and July 10, 2013, with 600 respondents, all of whom were registered voters between 18 and 34 who voted in the 2012 general election. The poll asked, ""Which of the following best describes your view of climate change?"" Here are the responses: • Climate change is a severe threat that we must start addressing now: 55 percent • Climate change is an issue to address in the years ahead, but it's not urgent now: 11 percent • Climate change may be happening, but it's a natural event that humans can't affect: 27 percent • Climate change is not really happening: 3 percent • Don't know: 3 percent This appears to support Murphy’s claim. We should note a few quibbles. • The poll was paid for by an environmental group. We always believe it’s worth noting whenever someone cites a poll paid for by a group with a perspective and a stake in the issue. However, the fact that two polling firms, one from each party, were included makes the poll somewhat more credible. • On a subsequent question in the same poll -- ""When, if ever, will the consequences of climate change personally affect people like you?"" -- the number answering ""never"" was 6 percent. That’s higher than 3 percent, though both are small percentages in the larger scheme of things. • There’s one other poll that asks a similar question and finds different results. But they aren’t exactly comparable. The Pew Research Center -- an independent polling organization -- surveyed a national sample of 1,504 adults age 18 or older between Oct. 9 and Oct. 13, 2013. One of the questions Pew asked was: ""From what you’ve read and heard, is there solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades, or not?"" Among 18- to 29-year-olds, 73 percent said the earth is warming, and 18 percent said it was not warming -- quite a bit higher than the 3 percent from the other poll. The two polls use different age ranges, but if respondents up to age 34 were added in, that would likely increase the percentage of global-warming deniers further, since an even higher percentage of 30- to 49-year olds said there was no global warming -- 28 percent. Why such divergent responses? One factor could be the precise wording of each poll. But a bigger difference is likely the pool of respondents. The LCV poll only counted answers from ""registered voters … who voted in the 2012 general election,"" while the Pew poll simply asked ""adults."" This means the poll results aren’t comparable in an apples-to-apples fashion. This difference might have posed a problem for Murphy, but he was careful with how he worded his claim. He said ""3 percent of voters"" -- not ""3 percent of Americans."" So we don’t find fault on these grounds. ""Pollsters don’t ask about climate change very often,"" said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""Most polls show that most people believe global warming is real. The question for policy makers is what kind of priority it should be, and here, many pollsters show it not to be very high."" Our ruling Murphy said, ""Only 3 percent of voters 18 to 34 don't believe that climate change is really happening."" It should be noted that Murphy cited a poll that had been paid for by an environmental group. Still, we couldn’t find any poll with genuinely comparable data that clashed with Murphy’s carefully worded assertion",True,"January 15, 2014"
"""61 percent of non-tea party Republicans actually agree...there is 'solid evidence the earth is warming,' ...[but] 70 percent of tea partiers, contrarily, say there is 'no solid evidence' the earth is warming.""","During his weekly floor speeches on climate change, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse has been promoting the idea that congressional Republicans who blocked climate change legislation are out of touch with Republicans throughout the United States. On Nov. 25, PolitiFact Rhode Island gave a Mostly True ruling on Whitehouse’s claim that, in a poll, ""53 percent of young Republican voters . . . under age 35 said that they would describe a climate [change] denier as 'ignorant,' 'out of touch' or 'crazy.'"" Whitehouse repeated his assertion about young Republicans in a slightly different way during his Dec. 17 speech on climate, his 53rd, focusing on the attitudes of the tea party faction of the Republican Party. He cited a poll that looked at all Republicans, not just those under age 35. ""Another national survey, this one by the Pew Research Center, found that most -- 61 percent of non-tea party Republicans -- actually agree, actually agree there is 'solid evidence the earth is warming,' with a plurality saying it is 'mostly because of humans,'"" Whitehouse said. ""But the tea partiers are different,"" he added. ""Seventy percent of tea partiers, contrarily, say there is 'No solid evidence' the earth is warming. And 41 percent of tea partiers assert that warming is 'Just not happening.'"" ""Unfortunately here in Congress,"" he said later in the speech, ""the dark, heavy hand of the polluters is helping the tea party drive the Republican Party off the cliff."" Was Whitehouse correctly characterizing the attitudes of Republicans in general and members of the tea party in particular? We went back to the Pew survey to look at those numbers. Pew conducted the poll of 1,504 adults from Oct. 9-13, 2013; 655 said they were Republicans or leaned Republican, and 304 of them identified with the tea party. Asked whether there is ""solid evidence the earth is warming,"" 61 percent of non-tea party Republicans said yes; just 25 percent of tea party supporters said yes. (The margin of error for tea party numbers is plus or minus 6.5 percentage points and 6.2 percentage points for non-tea party Republicans. So Whitehouse quoted the findings accurately, within the margin of error. Whitehouse was also correct when he said that 70 percent of tea party members responding said there is no solid evidence that Earth is warming, with 41 percent saying it's just not happening. In contrast, a mere 13 percent of other Republicans said it's ""just not happening."" Yet just because Republicans think there's good evidence that Earth is warming doesn't mean they think human activity is responsible. That's an important point to consider when looking at whether members of the GOP support trying to do something to reverse the trend. Among non-tea party Republicans who thought the planet is warming, nearly 40 percent said it was due to natural patterns. Our ruling Sheldon Whitehouse said that ""61 percent of non-tea party Republicans actually agree . . . there is 'solid evidence the earth is warming,' . . . [but] 70 percent of tea partiers, contrarily, say there is 'no solid evidence' the earth is warming."" The senator was accurately quoting the results of the October Pew poll. But there's more to the story if you want to understand the ongoing opposition to climate change legislation by supporters of the GOP. While many non-tea party Republicans acknowledge that climate change is occurring, a majority (54 percent) still either deny climate change or think it is part of a natural cycle not caused by human activity. That's an important factor to consider, which Whitehouse omitted",Mostly True,"December 28, 2013"
"""By using a little-known loophole ... Obama minions are allowing Nestle Company to export precious fresh water out of Lake Michigan.""","These days, President Barack Obama gets blamed for a lot of things -- the glitchy rollout of the healthcare.gov website, an unusually slow economic recovery, an out-of-control electronic surveillance network. But is he also at fault for selling off Lake Michigan’s water to the highest bidder? Several readers recently asked us to check a claim they had seen circulating on social media. The most commonly shared versions seems to have originated on the conservative blog Coach is Right and the website of the Western Center for Journalism, whose president is longtime conservative activist Floyd Brown. The post on the Western Center for Journalism’s site is headlined, ""Barack Obama’s war on America’s fresh water supply."" It reads: ""By using a little-known loophole in the 2006 Great Lakes Compact, Obama minions are allowing Nestle Company to export precious fresh water out of Lake Michigan to the tune of an estimated $500,000 to $1.8 million per day profit. By draining the precious jewel of the Great Lakes in the middle of America, our federal water managers are allowing the export of our water out of our country across thousands of miles of oceans into the Asian basin plagued by huge population centers that are suffering from their constant lack of fresh water."" We did not hear back from the Coach is Right site, but PolitiFact Ohio has previously looked at the question of water being removed from the Great Lakes and found that it was a genuine issue. It stems from an agreement known as the Great Lakes Compact. It was negotiated by and has the force of law in eight states -- Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. (Two Canadian provinces are also involved in Great Lakes water policy decisions, but technically aren’t part of the compact.) The most important provision for this fact-check is its prohibition on diverting water from the Great Lakes basin -- with a key exception. That exception -- the ""loophole"" referred to in the blog post -- is that the compact permits the removal of water in containers of 5.7 gallons or less. The existence of this provision has enabled the bottled-water industry to construct major facilities in the Great Lakes basin, including one by Nestle Waters North America in Mecosta County, Mich. Because the compact was designed to regulate and preserve the Great Lakes -- one of the world’s great natural repositories of fresh water -- such commercial sales have been controversial. Peter Annin, author of The Great Lakes Water Wars, told PolitiFact Ohio that the provision was one of the most emotional issues during the compact’s negotiation. ""Many people opposed the loophole during the negotiations, but each state included it anyway when they passed the legislation,"" said Melissa K. Scanlan, a professor at Vermont Law School who specializes in water law. Legislative fixes have been periodically floated in Congress, but none has yet advanced. So there’s no doubt that the question of whether Great Lakes water should be bottled for sale elsewhere is hotly contested. But does Obama have a role in it? No, experts tell us. Here’s why: • The compact was in force before Obama was even inaugurated. The agreement was negotiated during the mid 2000s, then approved individually in 2007 and 2008 by the legislatures and governors of all eight member states. Then, it was passed by both chambers of Congress and signed by President George W. Bush in 2008. Obama became president in 2009. We should note that Obama was in the U.S. Senate when it passed that chamber. The compact passed the Senate by unanimous consent -- that is, approval without any objections from senators and without a recorded vote of yeas and nays. Still, the heavy legislative lifting was long done by that point, and with so many other state and federal entities weighing in during the lengthy negotiation and approval process, it seems a stretch to attribute primary blame for the ""loophole"" to then-Sen. Obama. • It is a compact among states, not something imposed by the federal government. According to Article 1, Section 10 of the Constitution, the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate and the president must give their approval to an interstate compact. However, once approved, compacts are fundamentally agreements between states, not between the states and the federal government. Several experts told PolitiFact that there is no significant oversight or enforcement role for the federal government in regards to the compact -- in other words, no opportunity for Obama’s ""minions"" to cause havoc. • Elected officials from both parties had a role in approving the compact, and continue to carry out its provisions. State legislatures and governors of both parties approved the compact initially, and today, a majority of the states and legislative chambers that are party to the agreement are actually controlled by Republicans, not Democrats. In Michigan, the state where the Nestle plant is located, the governor’s office and both chambers of the Legislature are in Republican hands. In general, the Great Lakes Compact has been ""very nonpartisan for an environmental policy,"" said Noah Hall, a professor at Wayne State University Law School in Detriot and author of the Great Lakes Law blog. Our ruling Bloggers have said that ""by using a little-known loophole ... Obama minions are allowing Nestle Co. to export precious fresh water out of Lake Michigan."" There is an ongoing debate over whether Great Lakes water should be sold commercially out of the region, but Obama’s role in creating, approving and enforcing the Great Lakes Compact on an ongoing basis -- which is likely the driving reason the claim has attracted attention on social media -- is actually minimal, experts say. In other words, his ""minions"" have not meddled in this dispute",Mostly False,"December 17, 2013"
"""The Earth is not warming.""","Barry Smitherman sees the planet as not warming. Smitherman, a candidate for Texas attorney general, responded to Republican activist Donna Garner in a Nov. 17, 2013, email: ""Donna, I have been battling this global warming hoax for 6 years now. The earth is not warming…"" A day later, Garner included his comment in an email blast to recipients including reporters. That claim by Smitherman, who also chairs the Texas Railroad Commission, contradicts the latest word from the international body that regularly sifts scientific findings related to climate. An October 2013 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report intended for policymakers states: ""Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased."" Candidate's backup We were curious how Smitherman reached his conclusion. His campaign consultant, Allen Blakemore, emailed us web links to about a dozen articles essentially saying that the planet has not been warming as fast as predicted of late or is, in fact, cooling. A Jan. 27, 2012, Wall Street Journal opinion piece, signed by 16 scientists, said there was no need for countries to take drastic steps against greenhouse gases. A secondary theme of the piece was that planetary warming had been smaller than predicted for more than a decade. Similarly, a Sept. 8, 2013, news story in the Telegraph, a British newspaper, said: ""Despite the original forecasts, major climate research centres now accept that there has been a ‘pause’ in global warming since 1997."" The story quoted two U.S. professors, Judith Curry of the Georgia Institute of Technology and Anastasios Tsonis of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, as saying the planet appears headed into a cooling period. A Forbes magazine article by Peter Ferrara, published May 31, 2012, said ""natural climate cycles have already turned from warming to cooling, global temperatures have already been declining for more than 10 years, and global temperatures will continue to decline for another two decades or more,"" a conclusion Ferrara attributed to presentations at a conference on climate change hosted by the libertarian Heartland Institute. By email, Blakemore and Jared Craighead, Smitherman’s campaign manager, urged us to view a video placed on YouTube on June 27, 2012, of a presentation by Don Easterbrook, a professor emeritus of geology at Western Washington University. In it, Easterbrook said that scant temperature changes support his 2000 statement that global warming is over, making the key question only how intense the cooling period will be. Also noted by Blakemore: An Oct. 13, 2012, commentary by David Rose in the Daily Mail, a British publication, which began: ""The world stopped getting warmer almost 16 years ago, according to new data released last week. The figures, which have triggered debate among climate scientists, reveal that from the beginning of 1997 until August 2012, there was no discernible rise in aggregate global temperatures. This means that the ‘plateau’ or ‘pause’ in global warming has now lasted for about the same time as the previous period when temperatures rose, 1980 to 1996. Before that, temperatures had been stable or declining for about 40 years."" Rose quoted Curry, of Georgia, as saying the data confirmed a pause in global warming. ""Climate models are very complex, but they are imperfect and incomplete,"" Curry said. ""Natural variability (the impact of factors such as long-term temperature cycles in the oceans and the output of the sun) has been shown over the past two decades to have a magnitude that dominates the greenhouse warming effect. It is becoming increasingly apparent that our attribution of warming since 1980 and future projections of climate change needs to consider natural internal variability as a factor of fundamental importance,"" Curry said. Still, and in contrast to Smitherman’s claim, the Daily Mail article closed by referring to global warming as ""real, and some of it at least has been caused by the CO2 emitted by fossil fuels. But the evidence is beginning to suggest that it may be happening much slower than the catastrophists have claimed–a conclusion with enormous policy implications."" Debate about reconsideration By email, Curry didn’t directly answer whether the globe is warming: ""There has been no statistically significant increase in global average surface temperatures for the past 17 years."" Per Curry’s point, Michael Tobis, an Austin software engineer whose blog, Planet 3.0, often brushes climate topics, said by email: ""There are strong indications that the deep ocean is heating more than anticipated, which would account for some missing warming at the surface… But it's crucial to understand this--the world has not wandered so far from what we expected as to require a deep reconsideration of the consensus"" that global warming persists. Tobis continued: ""There's no doubt that CO2 is piling up in the atmosphere. There's no doubt that human activity caused it. There's no doubt that CO2 is a major factor in how energy flows through the climate system, and that changing it leads to a changed climate. There's practically no doubt that in the long run the planet will end up substantially warmer than it is. Figuring out how it gets from here to there matters a lot to human beings who live out our brief lives during the adjustment period. And there are some uncertainties there--it turns out transitions are harder to calculate than final outcomes. But nothing we see reduces our confidence in our understanding."" Separately, the Texas state climatologist, John Nielsen-Gammon, pointed out by email a National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration chart indicating a steady rise in ocean heat content, meaning temperatures averaged through the depth of the ocean, since the late 1960s. Like Tobis, though, Nielsen-Gammon said temperatures near the ocean surface have risen more slowly in the past 15 years or so ""than they had during the previous 35, and it is possible to find time intervals (such as the past five years) in which all weather station and satellite-based global temperature compilations show a declining trend. Overall, the global surface temperature trend is essentially flat since the dramatic and unusual warmth of the 1998 El Niño year. Nielsen-Gammon’s email continued: ""Just about everyone, including some of the sources quoted in the articles you listed,"" meaning the articles noted by Smitherman’s consultant, ""believes that the present lack of surface temperature warming is both natural and temporary. Climate model projections have generally been higher than observed temperatures, which depending on your interpretation means that natural variability has temporarily masked some of the warming or that the models have overestimated the amount of non-natural warming. The causes of the discrepancy are the subject of considerable research."" Cherry-picking a time period Our own online search led us to a Sept. 10, 2013, commentary by Forbes magazine staff writer Alex Knapp taking Rose to task for focusing too closely on short-term temperature changes. On the suggestion that global warming paused in 1997, Knapp wrote: ""Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, ‘All of the top ten warmest years in the record have occurred since the last major El Niño event, in 1998.’ What’s more, according to NOAA, ‘Since 1976, every year including 2012 has had an annual temperature above the long-term average.’ In fact the two warmest years on record are 2005 and 2010, and the years between 2000 and 2010 had higher average temperatures than the years between 1990 and 1999. ""To show the continued rise of global average temperatures over the decades, this chart from the World Meteorological Organization helps to make it pretty clear: ""These rising temperatures have serious consequences. Rising temperatures melt glaciers on land, including Greenland and Antarctica. As those melts make their way to the oceans, they cause sea levels to rise. And those rising sea levels are real and have been measured. Here’s a chart of sea level rise since the 1880s – you can see the steadily rising trend for yourself. ""The bottom line is that, as I wrote last summer, ‘In the end, everything about climate science boils down to one simple fact: all else being equal, increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide in a mixture of gasses will cause the mixture to absorb more heat.’"" Knapp closed: ""For our planet, that means as more carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere, the warmer the planet will get. Sure, there might be some short term anomalies – one year might be cooler than its preceding year, for instance – but the long term trend remains…"" Texas and U.S. climatologists Broadly, the Texas climatologists we reached said Smitherman got it wrong. ""The Earth is warming,"" Nielsen-Gammon said. By email, Katharine Hayhoe, director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University, called Smitherman’s claim incorrect, adding: ""First, climate is defined as the average over 20-30 years or more precisely because atmospheric scientists know that short-term natural cycles in the rates at which heat is exchanged between the ocean and atmosphere can lead to variations in global air temperature over shorter time scales."" Hayhoe and Tobis each cautioned that cherry-picking start and stop years can lead to factually skewed conclusions about temperature trends.""If you cherry-pick short periods of time, you can end up with nearly any result you want,"" Hayhoe said. ""Only by looking at the entire dataset can you see what the truth is."" Hayhoe noted, too, that a study accepted for online posting by the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Metereological Society on Nov. 12, 2013, shortly before Smitherman wrote his email, indicates that global temperatures have been underestimated since 1997 because they did not correctly reflect Arctic warming. Hayhoe further said the proper measure of warming extends past ocean or air temperatures alone. She pointed us to a chart posted on the Skeptical Science website, which focuses on touting peer-reviewed science related to climate change and debunking arguments built on incomplete information. The chart indicates that based on data published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres in September 2009, the ocean and earth have been warming for the past 50 years. Curiously, the state commission chaired by Smitherman, which regulates oil and gas exploration, has a section of its website detailing scientific concerns about greenhouse gases and global warming. A source note on that site led us to the U.S. Global Change Research Program, a federal effort launched by Congress in 1990 to coordinate and integrate global change research across 13 government agencies.  We then downloaded a draft ""climate assessment"" report from the program, dated Jan. 11, 2013, including a letter to the American people stating: ""Long-term, independent records from weather stations, satellites, ocean buoys, tide gauges, and many other data sources all confirm the fact that our nation, like the rest of the world, is warming, precipitation patterns are changing, sea level is rising, and some types of extreme weather events are increasing,"" the draft said. Another part of the draft, prepared by the 60-member National Climate Assessment and Development Advisory Committee, said: ""Evidence for climate change abounds, from the top of the atmosphere to the depths of the oceans. This evidence has been compiled by scientists and engineers from around the world, using satellites, weather balloons, thermometers, buoys, and other observing systems. The sum total of this evidence tells an unambiguous story: the planet is warming. U.S. average temperature has increased by about 1.5°F since 1895; more than 80% of this increase has occurred since 1980. The most recent decade was the nation’s hottest on record."" Previous fact checks From another vantag point, recent fact checks do not support Smitherman’s statement. PolitiFact New Jersey in July 2013 rated as True a claim that every ""single month since 1985 has been warmer than the historic average"" and that all ""12 of the warmest years on record have come in the last 15 years."" Those statistics were backed up by data released by NOAA scientists and NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. As for the warmest years on record, NOAA scientists estimate that the last 15 years have included the 14 hottest years and NASA scientists have said that same time period included the 13 hottest years. A month later, though, PolitiFact Rhode Island rated as Half True a claim that global surface temperatures have been flat for 16 years. This held up partly due to the cherry-picked and short timeframe, which swept in 1998, the El Niño year that made surface temperatures exceptionally warm. When you start near an unusually hot year, there's a good chance that subsequent years will be cooler. That fact check considered major climate databases including one from NASA and another from the Hadley Centre of the Met Office, which is the United Kingdom's National Weather Service. It also tapped a tool available at SkepticalScience.com, whose Temperature Trend Calculator page allows users to pick from among several sets of temperature data and pick various timeframes. Hadley showed a .170 degree increase over those 16 years and NASA's numbers showed a .251 rise. Neither increase exceeded what could have happened by chance. Upshot: The global temperatures that were rising so rapidly in the 1970s, ‘80s, and ‘90s appeared to have stalled. In fact, the Met Office had begun referring to the latest 16 years as ""the recent pause in warming."" Officials there had issued three reports to try to explain the plateau. They stressed that the last decade was still the warmest on record and asserted that temperatures will likely resume their rapid rise soon, although the agency is not offering a timetable. Said physicist Robert Brecha, of the University of Dayton: ""There is increasing evidence in the peer-reviewed literature that over the past decade or so more thermal energy is going into the deep ocean, rather than into the atmosphere. This is almost certainly just a temporary, cyclical process. The key point is that additional greenhouse gases trap heat in the earth system, keeping that energy from flowing back out to space,"" Brecha said. ""So if the atmosphere doesn't receive that heat [thereby increasing its temperature] that trapped energy is nevertheless building up."" For our part, we rated as Pants on Fire a legislator’s April 2013 claim that science has not shown greenhouse gases to be a problem. To the contrary, scientists have agreed for years that such gases contribute to atmospheric changes driving climatic warming. Naomi Oreskes, then a professor of history at the University of California, San Diego, sent us a chapter of a pending book updating her 2004 look into scientific consensus about climate change. A portion of the chapter said: ""Scientists predicted a long time ago that increasing greenhouse gas emissions could change the climate, and now there is overwhelming evidence that it is changing the climate."" However, ""to say that man-made global warming is underway is not the same as agreeing about what will happen in the future. Much of the continuing debate in the scientific community involves the likely rate of future change."" ""There are climate scientists who actively do research in the field but disagree with the consensus position,"" the chapter later says, ""but their number is very, very small."" We also contacted Oreskes for this article. She passed our inquiry to Richard Somerville, a professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, who emailed us calling Smitherman’s claim ""nonsense."" Somerville wrote: ""It is just plain foolish to focus on short-term distractions in the climate record due to natural variability, while ignoring the long term-trend due to human activities."" Somerville described Smitherman’s offered articles as unscientific, adding: ""They misrepresent or ignore what climate science has actually discovered(.)"" By email, Craighead of Smitherman’s campaign responded by stressing afresh the Easterbook presentation indicating a global cooling period since 1999. Our ruling Smitherman said the Earth is not warming. To the contrary, national, international and Texas climate authorities concur that the planet is warming. They also warn against cherry-picking individual climatic indicators or timeframes to conclude otherwise. That makes sense to us. In the end, this claim strikes us as both unfounded and ridiculous",False Pants on Fire,"December 13, 2013"
"""Back door gun control is in full effect in the United States"" due to ""Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency.""","Former Congressman Allen West has taken aim at a surprising gun control villain: the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. ""It seems that back door gun control is in full effect in the United States. Why? Thanks to Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), we can no longer smelt lead from ore in the United States. ...,"" wrote the Republican and retired Army lieutenant colonel on his website Dec. 1. ""So America, back door gun control is moving forward and while we are all distracted with Obamacare and Iran nuclear negotiations, our Second Amendment rights are undergoing an assault by clandestine infiltration."" Here’s West’s explanation in a nutshell: The Doe Run lead smelter in Herculaneum, Missouri will close its doors this month due to air quality restrictions. ""What this all means,"" West wrote, ""is that after December 2013, any ammunition that will be available to US citizens will have to be imported, which will surely increase the price and possibly come under government control."" Is West correct to conclude that the EPA’s actions are ""back door gun control""? A reader asked us to check West’s claim, so we did. (A hat tip to the Blaze, which published its own fact-check between the time we spotted West’s claim and the time we published it.) Lead’s dangers Lead is a serious health hazard. According to the Mayo Clinic, ""even small amounts of lead can cause serious health problems. Children under the age of 6 are especially vulnerable to lead poisoning, which can severely affect mental and physical development. At very high levels, lead poisoning can be fatal."" Lead contamination can be found in air, water and soil as well as homes from old paint. Lead-based paint and lead-contaminated dust in older buildings are the most common sources of lead poisoning in children. Adults who work with batteries, home renovations or in auto repair shops also may be exposed to lead. The health dangers prompted the U.S. to phase out leaded gasoline in the 1980s. As Doe Run announced at the time, the company reached a settlement with the EPA and the state of Missouri in 2010 which included paying fines and ceasing smelting operations in Herculaneum. But the news is gaining fresh attention now because the actual closure date of Dec. 31 is looming. West’s blog cited an Oct. 29 post by Terresa Monroe-Hamilton on noisyroom.net which slammed the feds for ""back door gun control"" in driving the plant to closure. (The Blaze reported that West’s initial post failed to cite noisyroom but later updated with attribution.) Monroe-Hamilton sent us to a post she wrote Dec. 3 in response to the controversy, in which she said what she wrote was an ""opinion piece."" But the long history of lead-control efforts casts serious doubt on the idea that the closure was driven by anti-gun concerns. Ever since the EPA was created in 1970, one of its missions has been to limit pollution from smelters which are ""terribly toxic sites,"" said David Rosner, a professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University who studies the politics of pollution. The Doe Run smelter, he says, was shut down because it was a major polluter -- not as a way of curbing guns. ""It had nothing to do with gun control or bullets,"" Rosner told PolitiFact. ""The idea of linking this to an issue of gun control or a surreptitious way for the government trying to shut down the gun industry is nuts. This was an EPA decision because of children who were being poisoned by what had come out of that plant."" While West, who represented South Florida for one term, pointed the finger at ""Obama’s"" EPA, the EPA’s case against Doe Run actually began decades ago. The St. Louis area failed to meet federal clean air standards for lead in 1987 -- during the Reagan administration -- due to emissions from the smelter, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported in 1989. Reagan wasn't the only Republican president to advance the anti-lead effort. In 2008, under President George W. Bush, the EPA adopted tougher air quality standards for lead that were 10 times more stringent than the past. In 2010, the EPA reached a settlement with Doe Run. In November, Doe Run issued a news release about the closure: ""Although the United States is home to a number of secondary lead smelters, which recycle lead from various sources, the Herculaneum facility is the last primary lead smelter in the United States,"" according to the release. The release explains that the company isn’t shutting down entirely. While the company is closing its primary smelter, which extracts lead from ore, it will continue to operate as a secondary lead smelter -- essentially a recycler for lead contained in other products. According to the company, more than 80 percent of all lead produced in the United States is used in either vehicle batteries or in stationary batteries for backup power used by the military and in telecommunications and medical applications.""In the U.S., the recycle rate of these batteries is approximately 98 percent, making lead-based batteries the most highly recycled consumer product,"" the company release said. ""These batteries are recycled at secondary lead smelters. We own such a smelter in southern Missouri."" The company added that lead is used in ammunition and other materials. Doe Run spokeswoman Tammy Stankey emailed PolitiFact to say that the company ""will continue to supply our ammo customers using secondary lead."" We interviewed experts on lead or ammunition to ask about the impact of the plant closure. Most said there should not be major concerns. Michael Bazinet, a spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, confirmed that lead used for ammunition made in the U.S. comes almost exclusively from recycled sources. ""While no one should ever be pleased about the closure of any industry, in this case there should not be a noticeable effect on consumers.  ... We should not see any effect on the civilian marketplace,"" Bazinet told PolitiFact. The foundation’s general counsel, Lawrence Keane, echoed that view in an interview with the Washington Times Others agree. While Doe Run is the last ""primary"" lead smelter in the U.S. there are plenty of ""secondary"" processing of lead in the U.S., Richard Lowden, a research engineer at the U.S. Department of Energy Oak Ridge National Laboratory told PolitiFact in an email. ""Primary lead is of higher purity and is needed for specialty applications such as unique types of lead-acid batteries,"" Lowden said. ""Secondary lead is slightly less pure and is used in most applications -- over 80 percent of domestic consumption, including bullets. The U.S. imports very little lead, with the main foreign sources being Canada and Mexico. I do not  believe shooters have to worry about a source of lead for bullets."" Florida Bullet, a Clearwater-based company that supplies ammunition to most law enforcement agencies in Florida, isn’t worried about the smelter’s closure. The bullets the company sells, made by Federal and Speer, ""use reclaimed lead, so this is not going to bother us as far as production goes,"" said the company’s president, Tom Falone. ""We don’t foresee this being a problem for us."" When we asked Michele Hickford, West’s spokeswoman, why he blamed Obama if the EPA had zeroed in on the smelter long before Obama was president, she said, ""The plant closed under Obama. Regardless of what this lead plant is used for, the EPA net is tightening on the entire industry, and if you follow it to its logical conclusion, the industry will be shut down eventually. This is yet another example of the Obama administration circumventing the legislative process to achieve its goals."" Our ruling West wrote that ""back door gun control is in full effect in the United States"" due ""to Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency."" But there is no evidence that it was a clandestine effort at back door gun control. Rather, the EPA’s settlement with Doe Run -- which concluded a case that began years before Obama was elected president -- had to do with emissions of a chemical that can cause serious injury and death to adults and children. And ammunition experts shot massive holes in the notion that the smelter’s closure would cut production, reduce supply or raise the cost of ammunition",False Pants on Fire,"December 3, 2013"
"In a poll, ""53 percent of young Republican voters . . . under age 35 said that they would describe a climate [change] denier as 'ignorant,' 'out of touch' or 'crazy.'""","Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) has now made 50 speeches on the floor of the U.S. Senate urging his colleagues and other Americans to ""wake up"" about the issue of climate change. He has railed against global warming skeptics, many of them Republicans who say that the planet is not warming or, if it is, the warming isn't caused by human activity. During his Nov. 13 speech, he argued that ""the polls show clearly that climate denial is a losing tactic"" and young people aren't fooled by the arguments of climate change ""deniers."" We've fact-checked two other Whitehouse statements from his previous speeches about climate issues. We ruled his claim that the oceans ""have become 30 percent more acidic"" Mostly True; his assertion that Narragansett Bay waters have gotten 4 degrees warmer in the winter since the 1960s earned a Half True. In his Nov. 13 speech, one of the poll numbers he cited caught our eye. ""Fifty three percent of young Republican voters -- Republican voters under age 35 -- said that they would describe a climate [change] denier as 'ignorant,' 'out of touch' or 'crazy,'"" Whitehouse said. ""Republicans outside of Congress are trying to lead their party back to reality and away from what even young Republicans are calling ignorant, out of touch or crazy extremist views."" Do more than half of young-adult Republicans really think climate change skeptics are loopy? Whitehouse’s office said he got the figure from a survey commissioned by the League of Conservation Voters, an environmental advocacy group. The league hired two firms -- GS Strategy Group (which does Republican polling) and Benensen Strategy Group (President Obama's chief pollster) -- to conduct a joint poll of 600 registered voters, ages 18 to 34, last July. Fifty-three percent of Republicans under 35 said they would ""describe a politician who says climate change is not really happening"" as out of touch, ignorant or crazy, according to a joint July 24, 2013 memo from the polling firms. (The rest, if they had an opinion, preferred characterizations such as ""independent,"" ""commonsense"" or ""thoughtful,"" which were the three positive options offered.) When Democrats and independents were added in, the ratio of people who considered deniers to be out of touch, ignorant or crazy jumped to 73 percent, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent. ""It is not surprising then that a climate change denier faces stiff headwinds with young voters, with 68% saying they would be less likely to vote for a climate change denier,"" according to the report. ""And even among Republicans, 47% would be less likely to vote for a denier."" It should be noted that only 7 percent of all respondents -- Republicans, Democrats and  independents -- characterized deniers as ""crazy."" We asked the League for a Republicans-only breakdown in that category because we suspect that very few would put skeptics in the crazy category. Spokesman Jeff Gohringer said the League would not release any further data. ""The purpose of the poll was to show that Republicans understand climate change is happening and they want to see action,"" he said. ""The disconnect in Washington is that this is somehow a party issue, that the Democrats support it and Republicans don't. But huge swaths of both parties support action on climate and they know it's a problem."" One important caveat should be noted. The poll asked respondents to classify people who argue that climate change is not really happening. But that's only the most extreme type of climate change ""denier,"" a word never used in the survey. Other people sometimes saddled with that label acknowledge that the climate is changing, but they argue that it's due to natural variability, not human activity. So the League poll only characterized the deniers with the most extreme -- and scientifically untenable -- position. That's an important distinction, which can be seen in the Pew Research Center's recent national survey on climate change, conducted Oct. 9-13, among 1,504 adults. A hefty 46 percent of all Republicans said there is solid evidence that Earth is warming. But the percentage drops to half that amount (23 percent) when Republicans were asked if the warming is mostly due to human activity. Nineteen percent of the GOP respondents said it's due to natural patterns. Our ruling Sheldon Whitehouse said, ""53 percent of young Republican voters . . . under age 35 said that they would describe a climate [change] denier as 'ignorant,' 'out of touch' or 'crazy.'"" He cited the number accurately. But the findings come from just one poll, commissioned by a conservation group. And the question he referenced focused only on the most extreme position of climate change ""deniers"" (those who believe that the climate is not changing). That term can also include people who acknowledge that climate change is occurring but don't believe it’s caused by humans. Whitehouse is making a leap by suggesting that the League survey is a gauge of how all ""deniers"" are regarded by younger Republicans",Mostly True,"November 25, 2013"
"""Eighty percent of the antibiotics in this country are fed to livestock.""","A salmonella outbreak traced to California chicken processing plants recently prompted Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., to raise a pet issue on MSNBC: antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The federal shutdown was limiting government’s ability to track infection, she said. But then she pointed to a deeper issue: ""the overuse and ruination of antibiotics."" An advocate for tougher requirements for farm use of such drugs, Slaughter told host Joy-Ann Reid that she’s been ""trying to save antibiotics for persons — for human beings."" ""Eighty percent of the antibiotics in this country are fed to livestock every single day, and it's creating a terrible problem of resistant bacteria,"" she said. Eighty percent is an awfully big number, and we were curious: Do livestock consume the bulk of the nation’s antimicrobial drugs? It’s an important question, because according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wide use of antibiotics in food-producing animals ""contributes to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in food-producing animals."" Emergence of resistant bacteria means if you get infected with bacteria from the food you eat, it might be harder to fight that infection with antibiotics. Drug resistance may be contributing to higher hospitalization rates in the recent salmonella outbreak, for example, the Los Angeles Times reported. Here’s how it works, according to the CDC: Ranchers give animals antibiotics, which kills off or suppresses susceptible bacteria, but allows antibiotic-resistant bacteria to thrive. Those resistant bacteria may be transmitted to people through the food supply, such as by eating undercooked salmonella-tainted chicken. Since the bacteria are resistant to some antibiotics, the infections may be harder to fight, causing ""adverse human health consequences."" So CDC ""encourages and supports efforts to minimize inappropriate use of antibiotics in humans and animals."" You’re probably aware of this effort in humans — it’s why doctors are discouraged from giving their patients antibiotics to treat nonbacterial infections such as cold and flu. Widespread use of antibiotics when they’re not required helps bacteria develop defenses to the drugs in a sort of microscopic arms race. It’s also the reason the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has asked farmers to phase out certain antibiotics important to human medicine when used merely to promote growth in animals. (The industry says this accounts for a small amount of antibiotic use. The FDA says it’s hard to say.) So, back to the 80 percent number. It turns out it has been a popular talking point since 2010 among those who advocate for restricting use of antibiotics on farms. That’s the year the FDA released newly required data on sales of antibiotics by manufacturers for food-producing animals. The FDA didn’t release sales information on antibiotics for human use, but pointed to national projections from IMS Health, a Connecticut company that compiles proprietary health data. The numbers let folks compare the millions of kilograms of drugs sold by manufacturers for use by food-producing animals (13.1 million kilograms) in 2009 with those sold for use by people (3.3 million kilograms). The 13.1 million kilograms of antibiotics sold for animals was 80 percent of the total amount of drugs sold for both humans and animals, which was 16.4 million kilograms. We should note this comparison doesn’t account for all antibiotics sold in the United States. For example, it doesn’t count antibiotics sold for household pets. A researcher with the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health’s Center for a Livable Future first did the math for a 2010 blog post that’s been widely cited. (The most recent reports reveal a similar proportion, as calculated by the Pew Campaign on Human Health and Industrial Farming.) Pharmaceutical company lobby groups such as the Animal Health Institute, though, have cried foul. It says the number is ""wrong and misleading, for several reasons,"" and cites the FDA. The FDA has indeed offered a ""caution regarding comparisons of human and animal antibacterial drug sales data."" It repeated some of those cautions in a 2012 letter to Slaughter herself. But while it offers a series of caveats about drawing ""definite conclusions"" from ""direct comparisons"" about the drug sales data  —  such as differences in dosages between different drugs and in the sizes of human and animal populations — it confirms both sets of sales data essentially measure the same thing. Both show the volume of antibacterial drugs, by weight, being sold to various outlets from the manufacturer. So, while they don’t offer a direct estimate of human or animal use, they do offer a comparison of sales by manufacturers for both groups. In 2011, the FDA provided the IMS Health sales estimates directly to Slaughter, describing the sales numbers as ""a surrogate for human use to compare to antibacterial drug use in animals."" We should note that about a third of the antibiotics used in food-producing animals are ionophores, a type not used in humans. (The agriculture industry argues this means they have nothing to do with antibiotic resistance in humans; Lawrence at Johns Hopkins says they may still contribute.) If you remove ionophores from the sales data comparison, the proportion of antibiotics that go to food-producing animals vs. humans drops to around 70 percent. There are also also plenty of limits, as the FDA points out, on the usefulness of the publicly released sales data to inform public policy on antibiotics on farms. They don’t illuminate the reasons animals get the drugs (to promote growth? to treat infection? both?). They don’t specify how the antibiotics are administered (injection? food?). The FDA’s asking for comments on how it might release more of the information it collects from animal drug companies, and says it will update reports from previous years with that new data. That might include, for example, a detail it confirmed to Slaughter’s office in a 2011 letter — that nearly all antibiotics reported for animal use to the FDA were delivered in food and water, as opposed to by injection. Meanwhile, the industry uses the current lack of detail to downplay the usefulness of the statistic, even as it fights efforts to gather and release more information. Sales data is ""not at all useful for understanding the benefits or the risks of using antibiotics to keep animals healthy,"" Ron Phillips of the Animal Health Institute told PolitiFact. Others disagree and argue that the data is actually quite revealing. ""There is some uncertainty in these data, but not enough to escape the fact that the vast majority of antibiotics in this country are used in food animals, not to treat sick people,"" wrote Robert Lawrence, a doctor who directs the Center for a Livable Future at Johns Hopkins. Slaughter, meanwhile, is sponsoring two bills, the Delivering Antimicrobial Transparency in Animals Act and the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act, to require more detailed monitoring and to limit the use of antibiotics to sick animals. Among those lobbying against both: the Animal Health Institute. Our ruling Slaughter said ""80 percent of the antibiotics in this country are fed to livestock."" The statistic comes from a comparison of FDA sales data for food-producing animals and private sales data for humans since 2009 — not all antibiotics sold in the United States. A letter from the FDA to the congresswoman confirms that most of the drugs for livestock are consumed in food and water. That means the percentage ""fed"" to animals may not be quite as high as 80 percent, though it would be close. Slaughter could have said more clearly that of all the antibiotics sold for use by people and livestock, 80 percent are for animals. But she was close",Mostly True,"October 15, 2013"
"Says Oregonians for Food and Shelter ""proudly features board members from Monsanto and Syngenta and the (Oregon) Farm Bureau also receives funding from biotech companies.""","During the Oregon Legislature’s most recent special session, one bill stuck out as an oddity. Four of the five bills dealt solidly with fiscal policy -- taxes and the Public Employees Retirement System. The fifth, though, addressed whether local governments could regulate genetically modified crops. The bill was thrown in as something of a bargaining chip. Gov. John Kitzhaber needed Republican support for his other four endeavors, and the GMO bill was one way to reach a compromise. This deal, however, rubbed environmentalists the wrong way. They began calling the bill the ""Oregon Monsanto Protection Act."" One of the bill’s critics was Rick North, the former project director of the Oregon Physicians for Social Responsibility's Campaign For Safe Food. In a piece he wrote for BlueOregon, a liberal political blog, he called out two of the local -- and wholesome sounding -- groups that were big advocates of the legislation. ""Oregonians for Food and Shelter and the Oregon Farm Bureau, biotech puppets who have most state Republican legislators in their back pocket, jumped into action,"" he wrote. ""OFS proudly features board members from Monsanto and Syngenta and the Farm Bureau also receives funding from biotech companies."" We were curious about the board member and funding claims, so we decided to take a look. The first bit, that Oregonians for Food and Shelter has board members from those two leading biotech firms was easy to check. We simply went to the group’s website and found, listed along with 34 other voting members, these two names: Michael Diamond, the director of government affairs for Monsanto, and Danelle Farmer, who was most recently listed as a senior state government relations manager at Syngenta. The names aren’t difficult to find -- and they’re listed along with their corporate affiliations. Naturally, we reached out to Oregonians for Food and Shelter to see if they had extra information we might consider. Scott Dahlman, the executive director, said it is unabashedly the group’s position to defend ""the right to responsibly use pesticides and biotechnology."" Next we checked out the Oregon Farm Bureau funding statement. We started by speaking with the bureau’s spokeswoman, Anne Marie Moss. She said it was probably true because the group has a political action committee that accepts donations from any and all groups. Moss stressed, however, that the Farm Bureau is a largely grassroots organization that takes positions based on what county members -- all of whom are required to be involved in agriculture or ranching -- vote to take up on the state level. ""We have members on both sides of that issue as well, but it's like a democracy,"" Moss said. ""Majority rules."" Generally, she said, the group tries to support all sorts of agriculture, whether organic or genetically modified, but often members come down on the side of fewer restrictions. ""We believe in the whole big tent of agriculture, all types are welcome,"" she said. There is already ""a lot of regulation so, as a whole, we try to push back. We don't want our members regulated out of business."" We took a look at the campaign finance records for ourselves and found that both Monsanto and Syngenta had contributed a significant sum to the group. Since 2006, the Oregon Farm Bureau has reported receiving about $440,000 in cash contributions. Of that, Monsanto has contributed $103,500 and Syngenta has given more than $19,000. That means those two companies represent a combined 28 percent of the total reported cash contributions. This year, Monsanto donated $10,500 -- $4,500 in mid-September. During our conversation, Moss noted that while the money is appreciated, ""Monsanto couldn't come in and give us a command directive."" Indeed, we found donations from other sources, including individual farms and nurseries. For our final stab at due diligence, we called North to let him know we’d looked into his claims. We asked him why he thought this information was important given that both groups consider themselves to be grassroots. ""I don't know that it's anything more complicated than ‘Follow the money,’"" he said. In an opinion piece for BlueOregon, North said Oregonians for Food and Shelter ""proudly features board members from Monsanto and Syngenta and the (Oregon) Farm Bureau also receives funding from biotech."" We’ve checked out both claims and found them to be accurate",True,"October 11, 2013"
"""Obama has jumped the shark and ordered the ocean closed!""","As we were drowning in claims about the federal government shutdown, this one popped up on our shores Monday morning: Obama has closed down the ocean as part of the shutdown. This brought to mind an image of federal agents tossing frolicking children out of the sea and soldiers marching on the beaches, barricading the bikini-clad set from taking a dip. We found numerous ocean shutdown claims on Twitter: ""Obama shuts down Atlantic ocean! Who knew the fed’s owned the ocean?"" and ""Obama and Dems can’t even close borders but are trying to close the ocean!"" and ""if Obama can shut down the ocean why didn’t he shut down the hurricanes and floods?"" We fished out this one to fact-check: ""It is official. Obama has jumped the shark and ordered the ocean closed!"" We dove in to search for answers. Has Obama shut down the ocean as part of the federal government shutdown? The key to the answer was close to home for PolitiFact Florida: the Florida Keys. The Florida Bay  Many of the ocean shutdown tweets linked to an Oct. 5 article on the conservative website Breitbart, which included this headline: ""Feds try to close the ocean because of shutdown."" It featured a photo of President Barack Obama swimming through ocean waves. The article explained that the closure related to the Florida Bay and linked to a Miami Herald article. The Herald pulled information from the Florida Keys Keynoter, which stated that boat charter guides received a message from the National Park Service banning them from taking customers to fish in Florida Bay, which is within the boundaries of the Everglades National Park. More than 1,100 square miles of prime fishing, between the southern tip of the mainland and the Keys, would be off limits until further notice, according to Dan Kimball, superintendent of Everglades and Dry Tortugas national parks. We tracked down the message that commercial use permit holders for Everglades National park received: ""Effective at 6 p.m. on Oct. 1, 2013, both Everglades and Dry Tortugas National Parks will be closed. While our law enforcement rangers will remain on duty, all other administrative activities and visitor services will be discontinued until the shutdown has been lifted. If you have a trip planned for Oct. 1, you must conclude your business within the park by 6 p.m. After today, you may not offer any services within the park's boundaries until further notice. We regret the burden that this will place on your livelihood. We will notify you when the park is reopened."" Kimball confirmed to PolitiFact Florida that the Florida Bay, which encompasses about a half-million acres, is closed due to the shutdown. However, there are exceptions, including transit through the park. ""You can’t anchor, you can’t fish,"" Kimball said. ""It has to be for transportation purposes."" Also, the feds will allow access in emergencies, such as seeking shelter from a storm, and they granted the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission access to monitor algae blooms. ""Just like the Grand Canyon is closed during shutdown -- it's federal property -- so is the Florida Bay under the Everglades National Park,"" said Jennifer George-Nichol, who works for U.S. Rep. Joe Garcia, D-Miami, who represents the Keys. The national park closure does not mean that the entire ocean -- whether in the Keys, the rest of Florida or elsewhere -- is shut down. There are still spots in the Keys where tourists can go fishing or jump in for a swim. For example, John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, which offers glass bottom boat rides and snorkel excursions, isn’t limited by the federal shutdown. ""At this time, nothing in the state park is affected,"" said Nathan Frier, assistant manager for Coral Reef Park Company, a concessionaire inside the park. ""We do have a lot of calls to see if we are open or not."" At Barefoot Billy’s in Key West, boat trips to the Dry Tortugas are canceled but other ocean activities including parasailing, boating and jet skiing remain open. ""We have numerous local and state parks and beaches, none of which are impacted,"" said Lisa Tennyson, director of legislative affairs for Monroe County. Enforcing the shutdown in Florida Bay We wondered how seriously the shutdown in Florida Bay will be enforced. Breitbart speculated that the government ""will probably use more personnel and spend more resources to attempt to close the ocean, than it would in its normal course of business."" The National Parks Service contingency plan states activities at parks and facilities will be suspended ""except for those that are essential to respond to emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property."" The majority of employees at Biscayne National Park and Everglades National Park and Dry Tortugas have been furloughed. Rangers have been notifying people that the park is closed and asked them to leave and generally have had good compliance, Kimball said. When we interviewed Kimball mid-afternoon Oct. 7, no one had been issued a written warning or violation. Our ruling Claims about the federal government shutdown include this one circulating on Twitter: ""Obama has jumped the shark and ordered the ocean closed!"" The tweet linked to an article in Breitbart that explains that the shutdown means that the Dry Tortugas and the Florida Bay are closed as a result of the shutdown. That means that 1,100 square miles of prime fishing is off limits -- a blow to fishing charter companies and others that benefit from that access. Biscayne National Park is also off limits. But it’s an exaggeration to state that Obama has tried to shut down the entire ocean -- or even to suggest that he has shuttered the Atlantic Ocean or all of the waters in the Keys. Tourists and locals can continue to fish, swim and play in the ocean, even in the Keys",False,"October 7, 2013"
"If sea levels rise six feet due to climate change, Waterplace Park in Providence and Wickford village would be swamped","A United Nations-supported panel of the world’s top climate scientists issued its latest assessment of the problem Friday, warning of potentially catastrophic consequences unless significant measures are taken to reduce greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide. Among other things, the report -- a summary of a longer study to be issued Monday -- warned that if emissions aren’t reduced, global sea levels could rise nearly three feet by 2100. Grover Fugate, executive director of Rhode Island’s Coastal Resources Management Council, expressed similar, and more dire, concerns during an interview on WPRI-Channel 12’s ""Newsmakers"" program, broadcast Aug. 23. Fugate warned then that some projections showed sea levels rising as much as six feet over the next 100 years. If that happened, he said, some of the state’s signature landscapes, such as Providence’s Waterplace Park and North Kingstown’s Wickford Village could be very different -- and smaller --  by 2100. ""The upper end of that range is now looking like, more like, six feet,"" Fugate said. ""Waterplace Park would essentially be gone … you look at places like Wickford, so the historic district in Wickford, a lot of that would be lost."" Waterplace Pond instead of Waterplace Park? Wickford swamped? Was that a deep thought or shallow reasoning? We decided to wade in. Friday’s report from the climate panel is just the latest of numerous reports and studies of the effect of climate change on sea levels. In December 2012,  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Geological Survey, the Department of Defense’s Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program and the Army Corps of Engineers prepared a report called ""Global Sea Level Rise Scenarios for the United States National Climate Assessment.""   The report said that an increasing number of studies have shown satellite measurements indicating polar ice, mostly from Greenland in the north and western Antarctica in the south, has been melting more rapidly than was previously thought, in turn making sea levels rise faster and higher than past projections.   The NOAA report warned the melting would increase sea levels, but the range it gave was higher than that described in Friday’s IPCC report. ""We have a very high confidence (a better than nine in ten chance) that global mean sea level will rise at least 0.2 meters (8 inches) and no more than 2 meters (6.6 feet) by 2100,""  the 2012 multi-agency assessment said. Fugate said it was that ""upper end"" -- up to 6.6 feet -- that he was referencing. The University of Rhode Island’s Graduate School of Oceanography’s Sea Grant program has been interested in rising sea levels too. The program works with the state’s coastal municipalities to anticipate where sea levels may rise and how to cope with it. Jon Reiner, town planner in North Kingstown, said the Sea Grant staffers have analyzed what would happen in his community with the kind of sea-level rises Fugate cited. He said their analyses confirmed Fugate’s warning. A 6-foot sea level increase, Reiner said, would inundate more than 150 parcels of land in the Wickford area, as much as 5 percent of the town. Teresa Crean, a planner with the URI Sea Grant program, said the value of that lost land was about $80 million. In Providence, the effects of rising sea levels can be seen on a website of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration that shows the foot-by-foot effects of rising sea levels. The interactive map doesn’t include storm surges or runoff, only what increases in sea level would do. According to NOAA,  a 6-foot rise in sea level would submerge the walkway around the Waterplace Park pool and enough water would flow through the tunnel under Memorial Boulevard to put the Capital Grille and Bar Louie on their own waterfront. But according to the NOAA, Waterplace Park might be the least of the city’s worries. Even more vulnerable are the wharfs off Allens Avenue in the area between Sassafras Point and Henderson Street. Parts of the newly cleared Route 195 redevelopment area would flood, as well as the neighborhood around the Providence District Court Building. Our ruling Grover Fugate said Providence’s Waterplace Park and Wickford village would be flooded if sea levels rose six feet, ""the upper end"" of some climate change estimates. While Fugate’s high-end figure is double the estimate of the Intergovernmental Climate Change Committee, he was accurately quoting a figure that has been cited by four U.S.  agencies that deal with oceans and climate. And federal, state and local planners and agencies agree that a six-foot rise would swamp significant locations in Providence, Wickford and elsewhere in coastal Rhode Island, as Fugate said it would",True,"September 28, 2013"
"""Over the past 35 years, Florida families have paid into the (National Flood Insurance Program) over $16 billion, four times more than the amount they have received in claim reimbursements.""","Some Floridians are about to face a wallop of an increase on flood insurance -- and that’s something Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who is campaigning for re-election, hopes to stop. Scott wrote a letter to Florida’s U.S. senators, Republican Marco Rubio and Democrat Bill Nelson, urging Congress to delay a planned rate hike on some flood insurance policies and to continue federal subsidies. For that to happen, the Senate needs to vote on a proposal that the House approved in June. Nelson has indicated he supports a delay, while Rubio’s position has been less clear. The Tampa Bay Times reported in September that Rubio ""will continue to work with colleagues on solutions to make the flood program sustainable 'without excessively burdening Florida's families,' spokeswoman Brooke Sammon said."" Florida has already gotten the short end of the stick on flood insurance, says Scott. ""Over the past 35 years, Florida families have paid into the NFIP (National Flood Insurance Program) over $16 billion, four times more than the amount they have received in claim reimbursements,"" Scott wrote in a Sept. 17 letter. We wanted to research Scott’s claim about how much Floridians have paid into the program and how much we have received in claims. Flood insurance reform The National Flood Insurance Program, run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, started in 1968. More than 5 million property owners nationwide hold flood insurance, and about 20 percent are subsidized. After the 2005 storm season -- which included Hurricane Katrina -- the program became indebted to the U.S. Treasury. As of May 2013, it owed about $24 billion. (A recent General Accounting Office report gives a full dissection of the program’s shortcomings.) In an effort to avoid insolvency, lawmakers passed the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act in 2012. The law requires the program to raise rates about 25 percent a year for certain properties until they reflect true flood risk. The increases apply to businesses, second homes and homes that have had severe or repetitive losses -- that’s about 50,000 policy holders in Florida. For policy holders who own just one home, the increases won’t kick in until they sell their home, their policy lapses or they have severe or repetitive losses. The increases don’t apply to about 115,000 subsidized condos or multifamily homes or about 1.8 million policies that aren’t subsidized in Florida. According to a FEMA map, many of Florida’s affected homeowners are in coastal Miami-Dade, Pinellas and Lee counties. For those facing the flood insurance hike, it’s a double whammy on top of increases for Citizens hurricane insurance. Florida’s premiums vs. claims The state’s Office of Insurance Regulation directed us to an issue brief written by the University of Pennsylvania Wharton Center for Risk Management and Decision Processes. (Scott’s office directed us to a 2013 Tampa Bay Times article that cited the Wharton Center’s research.) The 2010 study showed that in some states policyholders paid far more in premiums than they collected in claims between 1978 and 2008 -- a 30-year stretch. (That's five years fewer than Scott claimed, but as we’ll see, the numbers likely hold true through 2013, for a total of 35 years.) In Florida, ""policyholders paid $16.1 billion in premiums but collected only $4.5 billion in claims reimbursements: that is, premiums paid over time were about 3.6 times the insurance reimbursements,"" according to the study. Florida wasn’t alone in paying more into the program than receiving back in claims. Thirteen states had an even higher ratio, and Colorado was the highest. (Florida was tied for 14th with Montana.) ""The situation is reversed in Texas, where flood insurance policyholders paid $4.5 billion in premiums but collected a larger $6.7 billion in claims,"" the study states. The study was based on data from the flood insurance program, so we went directly to the program and FEMA to check the data ourselves. We found fairly similar numbers to the Wharton study. The author of the Wharton study, Erwann Michel-Kerjan, told PolitiFact that his figure of $4.5 billion for claims in Florida through 2008 was higher than FEMA’s of $3.7 billion through mid 2013 because he accounted for inflation. Also, it’s worth noting that many of our big storms were in 2005-06, not in more recent years. So the trend in payments from 1978 to 2008 likely continues today. We asked Michel-Kerjan if we should expect Floridians to continue paying more in premiums than they receive in reimbursements. ""Keep in mind though that if there is a severe hurricane hitting the state and massive storm surge, the situation could well reverse: Florida might become a net beneficiary of the program, rather than being a net contributor,"" he said. ""This is what happened to Louisiana with Katrina in 2005."" The Tampa Bay Times explained: ""Like any other insurance, flood premiums don't reflect real-life events; they reflect risk. With its 1,200 miles of coastline, Florida is still considered more at risk than any other state. Just one major, slow moving hurricane that hits a populated part of Florida's coast could dramatically increase the state's flood claims. And private insurers have been unwilling to provide flood coverage."" Our ruling Scott said ""Over the past 35 years, Florida families have paid into the NFIP (National Flood Insurance Program) over $16 billion, four times more than the amount they have received in claim reimbursements."" A study from the Wharton Center concluded that Florida’s ""policyholders paid $16.1 billion in premiums but collected only $4.5 billion in claims reimbursements: that is, premiums paid over time were about 3.6 times the insurance reimbursements."" That statistic from the study covered 1978-2008, but it’s likely the trend has continued through 2012. The only key point that Scott omits is that this imbalance is common: Lots of states pay more in premiums than they receive in claims. A major storm could change that dynamic, and the purpose of insurance is to protect against such an event",Mostly True,"September 25, 2013"
"""Wind power is the most undependable form of renewable energy.""","The debate over Deepwater Wind’s plans to build two wind energy projects in the waters off Rhode Island and Massachusetts has raised several issues. Critics say the energy from the five turbines the Providence company initially plans off Block Island and the more than 100 turbines to be built farther offshore would be unnecessarily expensive. Former Rhode Island Attorney General James O'Neil, a lawyer who is fighting the projects, also questioned the reliability of wind energy when he appeared on the ""10 News Conference"" program that aired Sept. 1. ""It's not about the green movement. It's about what I call the Green Bucks Movement,"" O’Neil said. ""You have to consider the economic consequences of embarking on a mission which is going into the unknown. We do know a couple of things. We know that wind power is the most undependable form of renewable energy."" That claim caught our ear. We know the wind doesn't blow all the time. But, then again, it does blow at night, when renewable solar energy can't produce electricity. So which form is less dependable? When we asked O'Neil for his data, he offered some documents that didn't actually compare the various forms of energy. One unpublished analysis offered no basis for that comparison. He also suggested some people to interview. As we learned, there's a lot of debate over the matter. When you ask the experts about dependability, they talk about several issues, among them the likelihood of mechanical breakdown, the availability of what we will loosely call ""fuel"" (which includes wind and sun), whether a source can generate power when it is most needed and, from a broader perspective, whether the power grid can quickly tap power from other sources to compensate when one source fails. Fossil fuel plants break down all the time, said Willett Kempton of the University of Delaware and coauthor of a 2012 study on integrating renewable energy into the power grid. When it comes to breaking down, ""generally, wind turbines are more reliable than thermal plants"" such as those powered by natural gas, coal or nuclear, he said. Solar cells, with few, if any, moving parts, are least prone to mechanical breakdown, giving it an edge over the renewable forms O'Neil was talking about. So a more relevant issue for renewable sources is the availability of fuel, particularly wind and daylight, which vary by location. (That's not a problem with renewable energy such as geothermal because the Earth is always giving off heat.) O'Neil, like other critics, argued that a key problem with wind power is its unpredictability, but Kempton said you can predict when the wind will be blowing. We note that the National Weather Service predicts both the amount of cloud cover and the average sustained wind on an hourly basis six days in advance. That brings us to a third element of dependability: whether the power is produced when you need it. William P. Short III, a New York renewable energy consultant who has testified against Deepwater’s Block Island project, said that's why wind is less dependable than solar. Solar usually produces power when the demand is highest, while winds kick up, at least on land-based wind farms, after dark, when demand is lower. But Michael Womersley, a professor of human ecology at Unity College in Maine, disagreed. ""You tend to get more wind during the day than at night."" The other experts we consulted said that's not important because other parts of the power grid can ramp production up or down to compensate. The ability of power plants to throttle up or down to respond to demand, and to do it quickly, is a fourth issue surrounding dependability. It's what experts call dispatchability, said  Paul Roberti, a commissioner with the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission. Fossil fuel plants are much more adept at that than wind or solar. In the end, we turned to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which regularly analyzes various forms of electrical generation to assess cost and capacity. Its latest report, which looks at projects expected to be working by 2018, is billed as ""a convenient summary measure of the overall competitiveness of different generating technologies."" The report includes a measure of capacity, which spokesman Jonathan Cogan said is a way to gauge the reliability or dependability of the latest technologies. The higher the number, the more you should be able to depend on it for power, although the actual percentage will vary by region when it comes to renewable resources. Nuclear and fossil fuel plants typically have capacity factors ranging from 85 percent to 90 percent. But O'Neil was talking about renewable energy. In the EIA ranking, geothermal comes in at 92 percent, biomass is at 83 percent, hydroelectric power is at 52 percent, offshore wind is 37 percent, onshore wind is 34 percent, solar panels that generate electricity directly are at 25 percent and solar-thermal, where the sun heats a substance to generate power, is at 20 percent. So on a nationwide basis, wind power -- whether it's onshore or offshore -- operates at a higher capacity than solar, according to the EIA. In response, O'Neil said his ""statement that wind is the most undependable form of renewable energy remains my opinion"" and, in the competition between wind and solar, ""it is rather a close call as neither is the most reliable form of renewable energy."" Our ruling In terms of energy, dependability can mean different things to different people, and both solar and wind have their strengths and weaknesses. And the actual dependability of each technology is going to rely -- to quote the old real estate joke -- on three things: location, location and location. The only national ranking we found was done by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which takes various dependability measures into account. In that ranking, wind is less dependable than hydro, geothermal or biomass but more dependable than solar cells and solar-thermal. O'Neil made an unequivocal and over-arching assertion, but provided no useful support for it. The most convincing evidence we found says he's wrong",False,"September 8, 2013"
"Under the Endangered Species Act, ""only 1 percent of the species that have been listed have actually been delisted.""","The Endangered Species Act, the law that protects animals and plants at risk of extinction, has had some dramatic successes -- among them, saving the bald eagle, the gray whale, the peregrine falcon and the American alligator. But the law has also drawn complaints from landowners and energy interests that it unnecessarily harms economic development. The debate over the decades-old law is resurfacing in Congress, with critics of the law citing a statistic that raises questions about the law’s effectiveness. Specifically, a reader suggested we check a claim by U.S. Rep. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., in a recent interview with Wyoming Public Radio. In the interview, which aired Aug. 23, 2013, Lummis said, ""Our goal is not to repeal the Endangered Species Act. Far from it. Our goal is to make the Endangered Species Act work. We have a law where only 1 percent of the species that have been listed have actually been delisted. To me, that indicates a law that is failing in its ultimate goal which is to list species, recover them, and then delist them."" Whether the act is ""failing"" is an opinion, and as we'll see, opinions differ on that point. We wanted to concentrate on whether Lummis is right that under the act, ""only 1 percent of the species that have been listed have actually been delisted."" How does the act work? The precursor to the Endangered Species Act was passed in 1966. The law was revised in 1969 and underwent a major rewrite in 1973. A key element of the 1973 act is that it prohibits federal agencies from ""authorizing, funding, or carrying out any action that would jeopardize a listed species or destroy or modify its ‘critical habitat.’ "" While this doesn’t necessarily affect privately held land, many major development projects on private land may require one or more federal permits, so they can be delayed or otherwise affected by the law. In addition, states may have their own laws on endangered species. So what does ""listing"" mean? The federal government can confer protection upon species after completing a lengthy regulatory process that includes public input. The factors that would qualify a species for the list, according to the 1973 act, include ""the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range; overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes; disease or predation; the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence."" The two key categories are ""endangered"" and ""threatened."" An endangered species is at more severe risk than a threatened species; a species can be either ""uplisted"" from threatened to endangered or ""downlisted"" from endangered to threatened, depending on the improvement of its prognosis in the wild. Species can also be ""delisted"" entirely. That can be done if the threats to the species ""have been eliminated or controlled, based on several factors including population sizes and trends and the stability of habitat quality and quantity."" How many species have been delisted? The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, one of the key agencies that carries out the act’s provisions, has a running tally of species that have been listed and delisted. All told, 56 species have been delisted. Because Lummis said she was talking about the ability of the law to ""list species, recover them, and then delist them,"" we will use the 28 species that were delisted due to recovery as the focus of our calculation. We will exclude the 10 that were delisted because they became extinct, and an additional 18 that were delisted for a variety of other reasons, such as an error in the original listing. Meanwhile, 2,105 species have been listed as either threatened or endangered. So, doing the math, 1.3 percent of listed species have ultimately been delisted.. In other words, numerically, Lummis is right -- slightly more than 1 percent of listed species have been taken off the list because they recovered. Is this the only purpose of the act? Experts say that while Lummis was right on the number, they add that the number tells only part of the story. They argue that while delisting is great, it isn’t the primary goal of the law. At root, they say, the law is designed to prevent extinction -- and on that score, the law has been a success. Only one-half of 1 percent of species placed on the list have become extinct, which works out to a success rate of over 99 percent plus. ""By the time species are listed as threatened or endangered, their numbers are so low that preventing extinction is the major challenge, with recovery and delisting a remote consideration,"" said Wm. Robert Irvin, president and CEO of the advocacy group American Rivers. ""The law acts as an emergency room. Recovery requires much longer treatment through actions under the full panoply of conservation laws and programs."" In addition, focusing on delisting ignores species that have seen improvements in viability, but not large enough to justify a delisting. This has been the case for a variety of species, from sea otters to black-footed ferrets. J. Michael Scott, an emeritus professor in the fish and wildlife department of the University of Idaho, said studies suggest that more than half of the endangered and threatened populations are stable or improving, and that percentage increases with the length of time the species has been protected. Such statistics ""suggest that the act is far more successful than the 1 percent figure suggests,"" he said. Our ruling Lummis said that under the Endangered Species Act, ""only 1 percent of the species that have been listed have actually been delisted."" She’s correct, though one could just as easily say that less than 1 percent of the species placed on the list have become extinct, and that many species have improved without being delisted",Mostly True,"September 3, 2013"
"Offshore wind power is ""significantly less expensive than solar energy.""","EDITOR’S NOTE:  On Aug. 28, 2013, PolitiFact Rhode Island rated as False a statement by Deepwater Wind CEO Jeffrey Grybowski that offshore wind power is ""significantly less expensive than solar energy."" We based that ruling on a comparison of the estimated price of Deepwater’s planned 1,000 megawatt windfarm with a recent contract price for a solar project in Rhode Island. Deepwater Wind objected to the ruling, pointing to contract prices of several other Rhode Island solar projects. Based on that information and a second review, we have changed our ruling to Mostly True and are providing this new analysis. July 31 was a red letter day for Deepwater Wind, a Providence company that hopes to build the first offshore wind farm in the United States. That was the day Deepwater was announced as the winner of a federal auction to lease space for the farm in a 257-square-mile area of waters off Rhode Island and Massachusetts. (The company plans an initial demonstration project of five turbines off Block Island. The larger project would have more than 100 turbines.) It was in that context that Jeffrey R. Grybowski, chief executive officer of Deepwater Wind, appeared Aug. 4, 2013 on the TV public affairs show ""10 News Conference."" Host Bill Rappleye asked Grybowski how much the electricity generated by the turbines would cost. ""Yes, 13- to 14-cent power [offshore wind energy per kilowatt hour] is probably what we’re talking about, significantly lower than the cost of what we’ve seen for offshore wind to date,"" Grybowski said. ""Also, by the way, significantly less expensive than solar energy."" We wondered whether offshore wind is, in fact, cheaper than solar. We started with the state Division of Public Utilities and Carriers and the Public Utilities Commission, which both have important roles in setting the prices for renewable energy. Deepwater has negotiated with energy distributor National Grid, which is required to buy power from renewable sources, a wholesale price of 24.4 cents per kilowatt hour for the five-turbine demonstration project, steadily ranging up to 46.9 cents per kilowatt hour in the last year of a 20-year contract, according to division officials. The demonstration would have a generating capacity of 30 megawatts -- a measure of peak output over an hour. (A megawatt is 1,000 kilowatts. The average U.S. home uses about 940 kilowatt hours per month, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.) If the demonstration wind farm, called Phase I, works out as planned, Deepwater Wind expects to move forward on plans to build a large-scale wind farm, called Phase II, in the leased federal waters. Phase II would generate up to 1,000 megawatts -- enough, the company says, to power 350,000 homes. In an interview with PolitiFact Rhode Island, Grybowski said his comments on ""10 News Conference"" were about Phase II. He predicted that in the coming years, Deepwater will be able to negotiate with National Grid a wholesale price of 13 cents to 14 cents per kilowatt hour, escalating annually over the life of a contract. To check Grybowski’s claim, we first had to determine the price of offshore wind energy. That’s a challenge because no such project has yet been built in the United States. As proof that his 13- to 14-cent-per-kilowatt-hour estimate is realistic, Grybowski pointed to a formal offer by Deepwater in 2012 to sell Phase II energy in New York state for as low as 10 cents per kwh. The closest point of comparison is in nearby Massachusetts, where the Cape Wind project in Nantucket Sound is under contract with National Grid for a year-one price, adjustable with contingencies, of 18.7 cents per kwh. How do these prices compare with the price of solar locally? The Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources, which also has a rate-setting role in renewable energy, provided a list of 18 solar projects that have entered into contracts with National Grid since December 2011. The wholesale prices ranged from 18.5 cents per kilowatt hour to 33 cents, with the largest projects having the lowest prices. Deepwater provided a similar list compiled from National Grid data, showing 21 Rhode Island solar projects, with prices also ranging from 18.5 cents per kilowatt hour to 33 cents. By law in Rhode Island, solar projects enter into contracts with National Grid at a fixed price for 15 years and offshore wind at a price with annual escalators for 20 years. Four of the 21 solar projects on Deepwater’s list have initial prices lower than Deepwater’s Phase I price. All of them would be substantially less expensive than the final Phase I price because of the annual escalator. But let’s look at the Deepwater Phase II project that Grybowski was talking about, and let’s assume that his 13-to-14 cent estimate holds true. That’s cheaper initially than all of the Rhode Island solar projects. Phase II also has an escalating price -- Grybowski said the company expects to obtain a contract of about 20 years with prices escalating about 3 percent a year. The initial Deepwater price would be cheaper than all the solar prices. At year 12, the Deepwater price would surpass the cheapest solar project’s price. After 20 years, the Deepwater price would be about 23 cents -- still cheaper than 19 of the 21 solar projects. It should be noted that comparisons of solar and offshore wind prices in Rhode Island are tricky because of scale. There’s not much room in our crowded, tiny state for the sort of large-scale solar projects that exist in the Southwest, for example. The largest solar project on Deepwater’s list, planned for the former Forbes Street Landfill, in East Providence, would have a capacity of 3.7 megawatts. Fifteen of the 21 are less than 1 megawatt, compared with the 1,000 megawatts of Deepwater’s Phase II. On the national level, the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that the most widespread kind of solar power, photovoltaic, has a ""levelized cost"" of 22.4 cents per kilowatt hour, compared with offshore wind at 29.5 cents. ""Levelized cost is often cited as a convenient summary measure of the overall competitiveness of different generating technologies,"" the administration explains on its website. For a large-scale offshore wind project, Grybowski contends that the 29.5-cent estimate is inaccurate, based on faulty methodology. Our ruling Deepwater Wind’s Jeffrey Grybowski said offshore wind power is ""significantly less expensive than solar energy."" Deepwater’s small Phase I demonstration project would, in fact, be more expensive over time than all of the Rhode Island solar projects the company cited. But if Grybowski’s estimated electricity price for the much larger Phase II holds true, its price would ultimately be cheaper than 19 of the 21 solar projects. The gap would be a few cents for the larger solar projects and up to 10 cents for the smallest",Mostly True,"August 31, 2013"
"""We are about halfway"" to the president’s goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions and ""about half of that is because of the substitution of natural gas for coal in the power sector.""","When President Barack Obama took office in 2009, he set a goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent by 2020 if all other major economies pledged to limit their emissions, too. Improvements would be tallied against how much of those gases the United States put into the atmosphere in 2005, the year the global climate change treaty known as the Kyoto Protocol was supposed to take effect. The White House would have liked it if Congress had passed a cap-and-trade bill that in theory would create strong market pressures to reduce the release of carbon into the air. That never happened, but two major changes gave the president a shot at making serious headway toward his target. Energy consumption cratered when the economy collapsed and, as you would expect, lower energy use means lower emissions. On the more positive side of the ledger, the surge in natural gas production also helped the country move toward Obama’s goal, although not without concern over environmental side effects. In a question-and-answer session on climate change at Columbia University on Aug. 26, 2013, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz highlighted the impact of natural gas on emissions. ""In these last years, the natural gas revolution, shall we say, has been a major contributor to reducing carbon emissions,"" Moniz said. ""The president has a goal, as I mentioned, of 17 percent by 2020. We are about halfway there, and about half of that is because of the substitution of natural gas for coal in the power sector, essentially driven by market forces."" We pay attention to the president’s promises and track how well he delivers the goods on the Obameter. But we also thought it would be worth digging into Moniz’s claim. Department of Energy’s focus on carbon dioxide The Energy Department, predictably, looks at the way energy use contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, and in particular, it tracks the dominant greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide. The department’s Energy Information Administration recently published the numbers for 2012, and the details surprised many people. The update reported that energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in 2012 were the lowest since 1994. Compared to 2005, those emissions had fallen by 11.8 percent. That is much more than halfway toward the president’s goal of 17 percent. The update also said the biggest drop was due to the declining use of coal to produce electricity. ""Low natural gas prices led to competition between natural gas — and coal-fired electric power generators,"" the authors wrote. ""Lower natural gas prices resulted in reduced levels of coal generation, and increased natural gas generation."" And to produce the same amount of energy, natural gas puts less carbon dioxide into the air than coal does. The most detailed data is only as recent as 2011, but the shift from coal to natural gas is clear. In terms of power generation, between 2005 and 2011, use of coal fell from 50 percent to 42 percent while the use of natural gas rose from 19 percent to 25 percent. This isn't bulletproof evidence of causation, but it strongly suggests that the switch from coal to natural gas has played a role in reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Greenhouse gases —  more than carbon dioxide If the only molecule to worry about were carbon dioxide, Moniz would have been totally right, but many compounds contribute to climate change. Obama pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent, not just carbon dioxide. The Environmental Protection Agency’s latest report looks at all the relevant gases, some of which are thousands of times more potent in their climate change impact than carbon dioxide. The EPA’s tally also includes activities other than energy production that put gases into the atmosphere. The agency’s figures show that from 2005 to 2011, emissions fell by 7 percent. Measured against the goal of 17 percent, the country has more than halfway to go. It’s roughly at the 40 percent mark. It is possible that when the 2012 numbers are in, the rate of progress will have shot up. The Department of Energy reported a relatively dramatic decline in the release of carbon dioxide in 2012. The EPA’s next report is planned for April 2014. We should note that a separate report from Moniz’s agency gives cause for concern. The Energy Information Administration projects that energy-related carbon dioxide emissions will start to creep up in 2018. By 2020, analysts predict they will show only a 9 percent reduction from 2005 levels. Our ruling Moniz said the country is ""about halfway"" toward the president’s goal of a 17 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 2005 levels. In terms of carbon dioxide, Moniz is correct, but when looking at all greenhouse gases, data from the EPA suggests the country has a little more progress to make",Mostly True,"August 30, 2013"
"Says U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson voted to let oil and gas companies emit ""unlimited carbon pollution into our air""","On Aug. 14, 2013 -- more than three years before U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson could face re-election -- a national environmental group hit him with an attack ad. The first-term Wisconsin Republican responded by using the TV spot to solicit political contributions. We didn’t think we’d have to go into campaign mode yet for the 2016 elections. But we’re game. In the ad, the League of Conservation Voters alleges that Johnson ""has taken more than $100,000 from oil and gas and voted to let them keep spewing unlimited carbon pollution into our air."" Johnson has received $109,550 from oil and gas interests since his campaign for the 2010 election, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign contributions. So that is not really in dispute. Let’s see if he voted in favor of unlimited carbon pollution. Getting our bearings To be clear on terminology, we'll start with four points. 1. Global warming: The world’s leading science academies have long warned that the planet is warming. The pace has slowed in the past 15 years, although 2000 through 2009 was the warmest decade on record, according to NASA. In August 2013 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international panel of scientists, reiterated the role of human beings, saying in a draft report the odds are at least 95 percent that humans are the main cause of the warming in recent decades. 2. Greenhouse gases: The main human-caused producer of global warming is the emission of greenhouse gases, which trap the Earth's heat. 3. Carbon dioxide: Carbon dioxide makes up 84 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which has determined that greenhouse gases are a threat to humans. 4. Carbon pollution: Carbon dioxide -- or carbon pollution, the term used in the ad -- comes largely from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas. Like Johnson, many congressional Republicans elected in 2010 have expressed doubt about the science of global warming and opposed regulation of climate-altering gases. The ad’s evidence The Washington, D.C.-based League of Conservation Voters is ""a liberal-leaning organization that raises money primarily in support of environmentally friendly public policy,"" according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In the 2011-2012 election cycle, the five candidates who received the most money from the league -- Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin among them -- all were Democrats. To back its claim against Johnson, the League of Conservation Voters cited three Senate votes, each an amendment to a bill; one was in 2011 and two were on the same day in 2013. Two of the votes were noted in the ad and the third was cited by the league as additional evidence. 1. EPA regulations, April 6, 2011 Johnson voted for a failed amendment to an unrelated small-business bill. The amendment would have prohibited the EPA from regulating greenhouse gas emissions and repealed the agency’s scientific finding that carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases are endangering human health and the environment. So, under Johnson’s vote, the EPA couldn’t regulate any carbon emissions, including those emitted in the extraction and refining of oil, or by gasoline-burning vehicles. 2. Global warming, March 22, 2013 Johnson voted for a failed amendment to the 2014 federal budget bill. The amendment would have prohibited ""further greenhouse gas regulations for the purposes of addressing climate change,"" which includes global warming. Like the earlier vote, Johnson supported the status quo: no federal limits on emissions of carbon dioxide, or carbon pollution, whether by oil and gas companies or other energy producers. 3. Carbon emissions, March 22, 2013 Johnson voted for another amendment to the budget to require a vote of 60 senators in order to enact a new federal tax or fee on carbon emissions.The amendment passed. This measure doesn’t regulate carbon emissions, per se, but does make it more difficult to tax emissions. Such a tax, arguably, could lead to less production of energy that results in carbon emissions. For our purposes, the third vote really isn’t necessary in evaluating the claim against Johnson. The intent of the other two votes is clear. Johnson spokeswoman Melinda Whitemarsh Schnell told us the three votes sought to stop President Barack Obama’s administration ""from passing regulations that Congress had earlier refused to enact."" She also called the ad misleading because it showed smokestacks that suggested the production of electricity, and said gas and oil companies are not responsible for the carbon emissions used to make electricity. But the question here is the effect of the measures Johnson voted for. Chip Knappenberger, assistant director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, told us that as a practical matter, the only way to reduce carbon pollution is to reduce the amount of fossil fuel produced. But he said Johnson's votes do preserve the status quo, which has no limits on greenhouse gas emissions. Our rating The League of Conservation Voters said Johnson voted to let oil and gas companies ""keep spewing unlimited carbon pollution into our air."" Johnson voted twice to prohibit the EPA from regulating any carbon emissions",True,"August 29, 2013"
"""Global surface temperatures have been flat for 16 years.""","Sometimes it's the contradictions that drive PolitiFact to check a statement. In a commentary published Aug. 5, 2013, in The Providence Journal, Steve Goreham, executive director of the Climate Science Coalition of America, was critical of the science behind the warnings that Earth is getting hotter due to pollution. His first paragraph made this assertion: ""Global surface temperatures have been flat for 16 years."" Yet three days earlier, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that 2012 was one of the 10 warmest years on record. All 10 have occurred since 1998. Who's right here? We decided to check Goreham's factoid. We contacted him to ask where he got his numbers and how his claim stacked up with NOAA's. ""The short answer is that both are correct,"" he said in an email. ""Temperatures have been flat for the last 16 years and 2012 was one of the 10 warmest years on record."" We weren't sure how they could both be correct, so we again asked Goreham what he was using for data. We didn't hear back immediately, so we started looking on our own. Our first stop was the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration database. Those data show that over the past 16 years -- 1997 through 2012 -- 15 have been the warmest on record. The readings go back to 1880. But how did the temperatures change during that period? In 2012, the global temperature was 0.43 degrees Fahrenheit higher over land than it was in 1997. Over land and water, the difference was 0.11 degrees. That's not flat. But temperatures naturally fluctuate so much from year to year, It's misleading to just compare two points in time. Goreham is talking about the overall trend, which climate experts use to see long-term changes over time. To find a trend, you have to do a more sophisticated calculation, preferably over a much longer period than 16 years. But 16 years is the period Goreham chose -- and what many other global warming skeptics have focused on -- so we'll stick with that for now. The trend line shows that the annual global temperatures listed by NOAA rose by 0.141 degrees during that stretch. To put this in perspective, when you're only dealing with a 16-year period, a lot depends on when you want to start looking. If you shift the timeframe back by just one year, beginning with 1996, the increase more than doubles, to 0.351 degrees. When we heard back from Goreham after asking about the NOAA database, he said we would ""probably"" see flat temperatures beginning in 1997. He also suggested we look beginning in 2001 to 2012 and said the temperature trend in that period would be flat. In fact, it was a bit negative. But that's not the 16 years he cited in his claim. Why start 16 years ago? It includes 1998, when an El Nino made surface temperatures exceptionally warm. When you start near an unusually hot year, there's a good chance that subsequent years will be cooler. There's another problem: When you get into temperature changes that small and time frames that short, the natural variability of climate can be so large that any ""trend"" might be the result of chance. ""Generally, for these short periods, if you're within 0.05 [of a degree Celsius] per decade you're not significantly different from zero,"" said John Christy of the University of Alabama in Huntsville, one of the country's best-known skeptics of global warming. (Over a 16-year period, that means the change would have to be higher or lower than 0.144 degrees Fahrenheit to be significant.) ""None of the data sets show anything much different from zero since the last 16, 17 years,"" he said. Since the 1998 El Nino, ""it's been pretty flat. There's been a slowdown in the trend."" So by Christy's gauge of what would be significant, the 0.141 degree increase from 1997 through 2012 seen in the NOAA database is essentially no increase, as Goreham said. In addition to the NOAA database, we looked at the two other major climate databases, one from NASA and the other from the Hadley Centre of the Met Office, which is the United Kingdom's National Weather Service. We used a tool available at SkepticalScience.com, which supports the global warming theory as do the vast majority of climate scientists. Its Temperature Trend Calculator page allows users to pick from among several sets of temperature data and pick various timeframes. Hadley showed a .170 degree increase over those 16 years and NASA's numbers showed a .251 rise. Although they would indicate a significant rise by Christy's off-the-cuff definition, a more precise calculation done by the Temperature Trend Calculator showed that none of the increases exceeded chance. Thus, the global temperatures that were rising so rapidly in the 1970s, ‘80s, and ‘90s have stalled. The Met Office has begun referring to the last 16 years as ""the recent pause in warming."" Officials there have issued three reports to try to explain the plateau. They stressed that the last decade was still the warmest on record and asserted that temperatures will likely resume their rapid rise soon, although the agency is not offering a timetable. Said physicist Robert Brecha, of the University of Dayton: ""There is increasing evidence in the peer-reviewed literature that over the past decade or so more thermal energy is going into the deep ocean, rather than into the atmosphere. This is almost certainly just a temporary, cyclical process. ""The key point is that additional greenhouse gases trap heat in the earth system, keeping that energy from flowing back out to space,"" Brecha said. ""So if the atmosphere doesn't receive that heat [thereby increasing its temperature] that trapped energy is nevertheless building up."" One last note. Goreham, in his commentary, was citing the 16-year trend in a broader context. He and other warming skeptics argue, with some justification, that the newest global readings are so far afield from the alarming temperature increases that were once predicted by climate computer models, it raises serious questions about whether scientists understand Earth's changing climate as well as they think they do, and whether it's worth spending trillions of dollars to try to influence it. But we'll save that controversy for another fact-check. Our ruling Steve Goreham said ""Global surface temperatures have been flat for 16 years."" The databases we checked generally show small increases during that period, but not enough to be statistically significant, thanks to a short timeframe and a starting point that included an unusually warm year in 1998. That's why, at the same time, NOAA data clearly show that global temperatures in 15 of the last 16 years have been the hottest recorded. So Goreham is correct that the temperature trend has been flat, but it's flat at record highs",Half True,"August 25, 2013"
"Says he ""sued Obama’s EPA seven times.""","Want to burnish your conservative credentials in Texas? Doesn’t hurt to point out how many times you’ve sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Campaigning for attorney general, Railroad Commission head Barry Smitherman uploaded a video to YouTube on Aug. 5, 2013, in which he said that he’d ""sued Obama’s EPA seven times to protect Texas jobs and energy for our families."" PolitiFact Texas examined a related statement May 10, 2013, from the man holding the job Smitherman wants. State Attorney General Greg Abbott said he’d sued President Barack Obama’s administration 25 times, a claim we rated as True. Now running for governor, Abbott is highlighting his suits against the EPA (he’s up to 19). In many lawsuits, Abbott acts at the request of a department or branch of Texas state government. Spokeswoman Lauren Bean told us for that story, ""We file them on behalf of state agencies. We’re the lawyer, they’re the client."" That client capacity, Smitherman told us by phone, was the role he took in seven lawsuits spanning his time at the state Public Utilities Commission (2004-2011, became chairman in 2007), and Railroad Commission (2011-present, became chairman in 2012). The suits deal with greenhouse gases, cross-state air pollution and specific airborne toxins such as mercury. ""What we have seen with all of these,"" Smitherman said, ""is this EPA initiating rule-making that in my opinion is not backed up by law."" His spokesman, Allen Blakemore, emailed us a list and descriptions of the seven lawsuits that he said Smitherman had, either individually or on behalf of the commissions, referred to the attorney general. What action is involved in such a referral ""depends upon the case,"" Blakemore said. For example, in the two lawsuits that involved Smitherman’s role on the Railroad Commission, he said, ""the commission voted to request representation by"" Abbott. ""A letter was then written to the AG requesting that action be taken against EPA."" Here’s the top of one such letter, signed by Railroad Commission chairwoman Elizabeth Ames Jones and by railroad commissioners Smitherman and David Porter, dated Aug. 23, 2011: 
 We looked up the lawsuits on PACER, a federal service providing public access to records from U.S. district, bankruptcy and appellate courts. All originated after Obama’s first inauguration Jan. 20, 2009. Smitherman is personally named as a plaintiff in three cases in his capacity as head of the PUC. The other four cases list only the agencies’ names as plaintiffs, but going by their filing dates, Smitherman was PUC chairman when two were filed, a member of the Railroad Commission when one was filed and chairman of the Railroad Commission in the most recent case. Five lawsuits involving the PUC, Texas’ regulator of electrical and telecommunication utilities, challenged EPA restrictions on greenhouse gases that Blakemore said ""threatened the ability of electric utilities to receive permits, modifications or build new facilities."" The two suits involving the Railroad Commission, Texas’ regulator of oil and gas, addressed a cross-state air pollution rule and a restriction on airborne mercury and other toxins that, Blakemore said, adversely affected mining for lignite used in electricity generation. (Created in 1891 to oversee, well, railroads, the commission ooched into energy after getting jurisdiction in 1917 over pipelines transporting oil and gas.) We asked University of Texas Law School professor Charles Silver, whose specialties include the procedures and practices used in civil lawsuits, if it’s reasonable to say Smitherman ""sued"" the EPA in these cases. ""Seems fair to me,"" Silver told us via email. ""In ordinary conversations, people don’t make the sort of technical distinctions you identify"" -- such as being specifically named as a plaintiff vs. the commission being named -- ""even though they’re accurate."" Our ruling Smitherman said he ""sued Obama’s EPA seven times."" In the seven EPA lawsuits -- all during the Obama administration -- that his spokesman identified, either Smitherman or the commission he served on at the time is named as a plaintiff",True,"August 21, 2013"
"Sen. Marco Rubio ""refuses to accept the basic science"" on climate change and is ""a climate change denier.""","In a recent email to supporters in Florida, Organizing for Action -- a group that supports President Barack Obama -- criticized the climate change policies of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., one of the Senate’s leading Republicans and a possible 2016 presidential contender. The email, signed by Ivan Frishberg, the group’s climate campaign manager, begins like this: ""Friend -- ""We're spending the next week of Action August getting serious about climate change. ""To get ready, we're calling out Sen. Marco Rubio, who refuses to accept the basic science on this issue -- and is standing in the way of action. ""It's time everyone in Florida knows: Sen. Rubio is a climate change denier."" The email goes on to say that ""there are 135 documented climate change deniers currently roaming the halls of Congress."" The full list is here, but in this item we’ll be focusing on whether Rubio ""is a climate change denier."" We should clarify up front: In the policy context, the term ""climate change"" refers to rising temperatures and sea levels caused by human beings and their use of carbon-dioxide-emitting fossil fuels. (We should also note that Rubio’s staff did not respond when contacted for this story.) In supporting its claim, OFA cites a Feb. 13, 2010, article in the Tampa Tribune. According to the Tribune, Rubio called his then-Senate opponent Charlie Crist ""a believer in man-made global warming"" and said, ""I don't think there's the scientific evidence to justify it."" Asked whether he accepts scientific evidence that the global climate is undergoing change, Rubio responded, ""The climate is always changing. The climate is never static. The question is whether it's caused by man-made activity and whether it justifies economically destructive government regulation."" After trying to locate as many of Rubio’s comments on climate change as we could, we concluded that the Tribune story is indeed the strongest evidence OFA can use to support its labeling of Rubio as a ""climate change denier."" Rubio’s language to the Tribune is pretty clear: He doesn’t think there’s sufficient scientific evidence to support the claim that the climate is changing due to human factors. However, on other occasions -- both before and after the Tribune interview -- Rubio has offered somewhat more nuanced opinions on the topic. Initially, when he was speaker of the Florida House, Rubio seemed to tacitly support the idea that the earth’s temperatures were rising, even as he sometimes differed with environmentalists over specific policy options. While Rubio was speaker in 2008, the House unanimously passed a law ordering the state Department of Environmental Protection to develop rules for companies to limit their emissions of carbon dioxide, a pollutant that scientists say may be contributing to global warming. In a 2007 speech to fellow legislators, Rubio urged his state to become a Silicon Valley of the new energy-technology economy. ""Global warming, dependence on foreign sources of fuel, and capitalism have come together to create opportunities for us that were unimaginable just a few short years ago,"" he said. ""Today, Florida has the opportunity to pursue bold energy policies, not just because they’re good for our environment, but because people can actually make money doing it. This nation and ultimately the world is headed toward emission caps and energy diversification."" By phrasing it this way, without any effort to question the scientific underpinnings of global warming, Rubio suggested that he tacitly supported the science behind global warming. He made the same implication when he wrote in a 2007 Miami Herald op-ed, ""Whether motivated by global warming or geopolitics, there is widespread support for diversifying our energy portfolio and becoming more efficient in our use of energy."" By Dec. 10, 2009, Rubio was openly hedging his position on climate change science. Confronted with accusations that he had flip-flopped on climate change, Rubio told the Miami Herald, ""I'm not a scientist. I'm not qualified to make that decision. There's a significant scientific dispute about that.'' Rubio’s next flurry of comments on climate change came in 2013, after he had become a leading figure in the national GOP. Here are Rubio’s recent comments: • BuzzFeed interview, Feb. 5, 2013: In a video interview with the website BuzzFeed, Rubio said, ""The United States is a country, not a planet. On the other hand, if we unilaterally impose these sorts of things on our economy, you could have a devastating impact on economics. ... There has to be a cost-benefit analysis to every one of these principles people are pushing on. … The climate’s always changing -- that’s not the fundamental question. The fundamental question is whether man-made activity is what’s contributing most to it. I know people said there’s a significant scientific consensus on that issue, but I’ve actually seen reasonable debate on that principle."" • Republican response to the State of the Union address, Feb. 12, 2013. Responding to Obama’s speech, Rubio said, ""When we point out that no matter how many job-killing laws we pass, our government can’t control the weather – he accuses us of wanting dirty water and dirty air."" • Fox and Friends interview, Feb. 13, 2013. The day after his response to the State of the Union address, Rubio said, ""The government can’t change the weather. I said that in the speech. We can pass a bunch of laws that will destroy our economy, but it isn’t going to change the weather. Because, for example, there are other countries that are polluting in the atmosphere much greater than we are at this point -- China, India, all these countries that are still growing. They’re not going to stop doing what they’re doing. America is a country, it’s not a planet. So we can pass a bunch of laws or executive orders that will do nothing to change the climate or the weather but will devastate our economy -- devastate it."" • Statement on his Senate Web page, posted June 25, 2013: In response to a speech in which Obama outlined a series of measures on climate change that he could accomplish by executive order, Rubio said: ""This time, President Obama is discarding the Constitution and free enterprise system in the name of a job-killing environmental agenda. We must do everything we can to stand in his way."" In these comments, Rubio expressed strong opposition to Obama’s climate change policies, particularly on the grounds that the benefits would not exceed the costs. And he seemed to exude skepticism that climate change was an urgent policy concern, as well as the sentiment that human actions cannot change something as massive as the weather. Still, in these comments, Rubio never explicitly denied the science behind climate change, as he did three years earlier in the Tribune interview. In fact, in the BuzzFeed conversation, Rubio conceded that ""I’ve actually seen reasonable debate on that principle."" Someone who is a ""denier"" does not typically concede that his opponents may have a ""reasonable"" point. Our ruling Organizing for Action said that Rubio ""refuses to accept the basic science"" on climate change and is ""a climate change denier."" Rubio’s 2010 comments to the Tampa Tribune -- when he said, ""I don't think there's the scientific evidence to justify it"" -- represent the clearest evidence in support of the group’s charge. In that comment, Rubio does sound like he is denying the existence of science that supports the climate change hypothesis. Since then -- including on four separate occasions this year -- Rubio has expressed opposition to climate change policies while speaking more cautiously about the science that proves climate change is happening. On one of those occasions in February, he even conceded that he’s seen ""reasonable debate"" about the question. But in none of those instances did Rubio walk back his 2010 remarks, even though he had several opportunities to do so",Mostly True,"August 16, 2013"
"""We need to pass a carbon tax to stop climate change. Break up the Wall Street banks. And stop the government spying on innocent Americans. Cory Booker doesn’t support any of these ideas.""","They’re among the more controversial issues in America today: climate change, behemoth Wall Street banks and domestic spying. And Rep. Rush Holt (D-12th), a candidate in Tuesday’s Democratic primary for the late Frank Lautenberg’s U.S. Senate seat, claims another candidate in the race doesn’t support taxing, breaking up or ending any of those issues for the betterment of the nation. ""We need to pass a carbon tax to stop climate change. Break up the Wall Street banks. And stop the government spying on innocent Americans,"" Holt said in a recent TV ad. ""Cory Booker doesn’t support any of these ideas."" Holt’s claim isn’t completely accurate, and raises an issue of semantics. Booker, the mayor of Newark, along with Holt, Rep. Frank Pallone (D-6tth) and state Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver (D-Essex) are the four candidates in this week’s primary. The winner will face the winner of the Republican primary between Steve Lonegan, the former director of the New Jersey chapter of Americans for Prosperity, and Dr. Alieta Eck. A special election for the Senate seat is scheduled Oct. 16. Let’s look at the three points in Holt’s ad and review where Booker stands on each issue. First, the carbon tax and climate change. Holt has proposed a tax on carbon dioxide emissions, which account for 75 percent of greenhouse gases during the past 40 years, according to a report from the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change that Holt references on his campaign website. He also claims that during the next two decades, a carbon tax could prevent the emission of 9.2 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide and by mid-century, reduce U.S. emissions by a third. Kevin Griffis, senior adviser and communications director for Booker’s campaign, said in an e-mail that Booker ""hasn’t taken a public position on a carbon tax, which is largely a federal or state-level issue. He has spoken extensively about the importance of regional greenhouse gas agreements, reducing carbon emissions and producing green jobs."" Booker also hadn’t take a public position on breaking up Wall Street banks by the time Holt’s ad aired on Aug. 5. Booker addressed both issues, however, in a campaign questionnaire to The Star-Leger. Booker said legislation must be passed that reduces carbon production, and involve a market-based approach, including cap and trade or a carbon tax. He also said in the questionnaire that he ""would support exploring additional rules"" to limit risky actions by financial institutions, but didn’t say whether he supported breaking up Wall Street banks. As for alleged domestic spying on civilian Americans’ phone calls and e-mails by the National Security Agency, Booker’s campaign says the mayor believes in striking a balance between enforcing privacy protections guaranteed by Constitution while also protecting the country from terrorism. Booker also supports amending, instead of ending, the 11-year-old Patriot Act, which reduces the restrictions law enforcement once had in investigating terrorism. So should the electorate care if a candidate doesn’t respond publicly on particular issues? ""One rule of thumb for politicians is that you have to define yourself before someone else does it for you,"" said Ben Dworkin, director of The Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics and an adjunct assistant professor of political science at Rider University in Lawrenceville. ""The essence of a campaign, a competitive campaign, is to draw distinction."" Griffis maintains that Holt’s ad isn’t accurate. ""Our basic position is that not being on the record about something, especially when the mayor would not have had occasion to discuss it in the past, is not the same as stating his affirmative support or opposition to an idea or initiative, and therefore, the Holt ad is misleading,"" Griffis said in an e-mail. The Holt campaign, however, emphasizes that Booker not taking a public position on significant issues speaks loudly to voters. ""With due respect to the mayor, ‘I haven't taken a position’ isn't a rebuttal,"" Thomas Seay, Holt’s communications director, said in an e-mail. ""It's a restatement of the problem."" Our ruling Holt said in a TV ad, ""We need to pass a carbon tax to stop climate change. Break up the Wall Street banks. And stop the government spying on innocent Americans. Cory Booker doesn’t support any of these ideas."" Booker hadn’t taken a position on those issues by the time the ad had aired, but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t support or reject them. It simply means he hasn’t taken a position thus far. But let’s look at the flip side, too. Without knowing where Booker stands on these issues, New Jerseyans can legitimately question whether he supports a carbon tax, breaking up Wall Street banks and ending domestic spying",Half True,"August 11, 2013"
"Says federal regulations adopted in 2011 increased the cost of each vehicle for his business by $10,000.","A congressional candidate says Uncle Sam is making it tougher to keep on truckin’. Mike Collins told the Gwinnett Daily Post that changes in federal emissions standards have added $10,000 to the price of every new truck his family’s trucking business buys. ""The EPA is stifling business,"" Collins told us, referring to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which helped write those standards. PolitiFact Georgia was curious about his claim and hit the fact-checking trail for more details. Collins is running as a Republican for the U.S. House of Representatives in Georgia’s 10th Congressional District, a conservative stretch of northeast Georgia. The current officeholder, Paul Broun, is running for the U.S. Senate. Broun’s successor will take office in January 2015. Collins is one of six candidates in the race. Collins’ father, Mac, served 12 years in the U.S. House, from 1993 to 2005, representing portions of several south metro Atlanta counties. The younger Collins is the vice president and financial officer of Collins Trucking, which boasts on its website that its vehicles can haul a minimum of 48,000 pounds of cargo. A heavy-duty truck can cost about $100,000. Collins said new federal emissions regulations that took effect in 2011 on heavy-duty trucks are responsible for some big changes in sales prices. In May 2010, President Barack Obama announced a plan to produce more environmentally friendly vehicles. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the EPA created new guidelines for combination tractors that are used for freight transportation, heavy-duty pickup trucks, and gasoline and diesel heavy-duty engines. The goal: reduce carbon dioxide emissions by anywhere from 7 percent to 20 percent, along with reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The new regulations took effect in August 2011. The EPA outlined the environmental and cost benefits in one report: ""The agencies estimate that the combined standards will reduce (carbon dioxide) emissions by about 270 million metric tons and save about 530 million barrels of oil over the life of vehicles built for the 2014 to 2018 model years, providing $49 billion in net program benefits. The reduced fuel use alone will enable $50 billion in fuel savings to accrue to vehicle owners, or $42 billion in net savings when considering technology costs. A second phase of regulations is planned for model years beyond 2018."" So have these changes resulted in $10,000 price increases in the past two years? ""That’s the number that’s been floating around,"" said Guy Young, vice president of the Georgia Motor Trucking Association, based in Marietta. There are no studies of the impact of emissions changes that took effect in 2011 on truck prices. An EPA spokeswoman said the $10,000 upfront cost is consistent with the EPA’s regulatory impact analysis for heavy-duty vehicles starting in model year 2014. ""It should be noted, however, that the same analysis finds that using technologies commercially available today, the majority of vehicles will see a payback period of less than one year, while others, especially those with lower annual miles, will experience payback periods of up to two years,"" said the spokeswoman, Davina Marraccini. ""For example, an operator of a tractor-trailer can pay for the technology upgrades in under a year and have net savings up to $73,000 over the truck’s useful life."" Marraccini said the standards were developed with support from the trucking industry. The National Automobile Dealers Association and American Truck Dealers released a report in March 2012 on the impact of emissions requirements on vehicles with a model year from 2004 to 2010. It disputes the EPA’s cost-benefit projections. ""EPA underestimated compliance costs by a factor of 2-5,"" the report said. ""These higher-than-projected costs resulted in, among other things, significantly lower-than-projected new truck sales which necessarily reduced the environmental benefits associated with these standards."" The report found the average surcharge on heavy-duty trucks made in 2010 that were compliant with the emissions guidelines was about $9,000 for nearly every manufacturer. For medium-duty trucks, the surcharge was generally between $6,000 and $7,300. Bill Iredale, who’s been in the truck sales business for nearly 40 years, said Collins was correct about the price increase. ""Absolutely,"" said Iredale, sales manager at Ace Beverage Refurb & Sales, based in Norcross. Iredale said the price increases have resulted from a series of new federal emissions regulations over the past decade. Ten years ago, a medium-body truck cost about $50,000. Today, the price is about $75,000. Iredale said the recent emissions requirements do have a positive impact on air quality. ""It’s a good thing,"" he said. ""It really helped clean up the air."" Young agreed that the vehicles have better fuel economy. ""They’re really good fuel engines, but (manufacturers) had to make some changes to get that way,"" he said. So, is Collins right? The EPA anticipated such additional upfront costs. Not surprisingly, the EPA and trucking industry debate the cost benefit of the regulations. The anecdotal evidence we heard and the 2012 truck dealers report suggest Collins may be right about the higher costs",True,"August 9, 2013"
"""For several days in July of 2012, Greenland surface ice cover melted more than at any time in 30 years of satellite observation. During that month, an estimated 97% of the ice sheet thawed.""","Everybody's looking for evidence that pollution, particularly the carbon dioxide released into the air, is (or is not, depending on your point of view) altering Earth's climate. On July 24, U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii, whose state stands to face some serious consequences if warmer temperatures cause sea levels to rise and storms to become stronger, was on the floor of the Senate speaking about an event in July 2012 that produced a dramatic change in the massive ice sheet covering Greenland. Because of global warming, ""glaciers continue to retreat. The Greenland ice sheet provides a stark example of the rapid recession of the world's ice,"" Schatz said. ""For several days in July of 2012, Greenland surface ice cover melted more than at any time in 30 years of satellite observation. During that month, an estimated 97 percent of the ice sheet thawed."" Ninety-seven percent? One way to read that is that only 3 percent of Greenland's ice sheet remained. That would be A LOT of melting, especially for a mass of ice that is, over large stretches, a mile or two thick. Losing that much arctic ice would have a HUGE impact. Not only would sea level rise by roughly 20 feet, the ice would no longer be reflecting sunlight back into space, warming the planet even faster. We contacted Schatz's office, which directed us to two sources. The first was a web page from the National Snow & Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado, Boulder, which tracks melting on a daily basis. It says, ""Greenland’s surface melting in 2012 was intense, far in excess of any earlier year in the satellite record since 1979. In July 2012, a very unusual weather event occurred. For a few days, 97% of the entire ice sheet indicated surface melting."" The estimate comes from satellite measurements. We also found a NASA web page that reported that in July 2012, ""an estimated 97 percent of the ice sheet surface had thawed by July 12."" So the key word in each case is ""surface."" The melting the satellites tracked was at and near the surface, often to a depth of no more than an inch. The ice sheet itself never thawed, or came close to thawing. Dorothy Hall, a senior scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, whose examination of the event is to be published in Geophysical Research Letters, said unusually warm temperatures that month did produce some unusual melting, but it didn't wipe out most of the ice sheet. ""Sen. Schatz's statement is very misleading,"" she said in an email, noting that her estimate of surface melt is even higher. ""The correct statement would be that approximately 99% of the surface of the Greenland ice sheet experienced some melt during a two-day period in July of 2012. In fact most of the ice sheet surface re-froze within hours or days of the big melt event."" Hall said that the last time that much surface ice temporarily melted was about a century ago. ""If that begins to happen more frequently, that is a red flag,"" she said. At the highest elevations, ""the surface will only melt a few centimeters for a few minutes or hours, so none of that liquid water can run off and contribute to sea level rise,"" she said in an interview. The thaw was deeper and more extensive at lower altitudes, producing some ponds and runoff, but even in those cases, much of the water re-froze, although quite a bit made its way to the ocean to contribute to sea level rise. How much of the ice sheet was actually lost? Satellite data show that Greenland lost about 325 billion metric tons of ice that month, enough to raise sea level by nearly a millimeter. That's a lot. Typically, 340 billion metric tons are lost in a full year, according to climate researcher Jason Box of the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland. However, the amount of ice lost was only about 0.01 percent of the nearly 3 million billion tons of ice locked in the sheet. When we asked Schatz's office if the senator misspoke, spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa stood by his comment. ""The senator said that 97 percent of the ice sheet thawed . . . which means to become soft, and does not mean vanish. He also specifically said 'for several days in July of 2012,' so that it would be clear that he was not implying that the ice vanished forever. To suggest that the senator said it disappeared is inaccurate."" Thomas Mote, a geographer at the University of Georgia, says it's a ""common mistake"" to confuse the thawing of the surface ice with the thawing of the ice sheet. ""Certainly we did not lose 97 percent of the ice. Sea levels would quickly go up 20 feet,"" he said. ""We would notice that pretty quickly."" Our ruling Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz said: ""For several days in July of 2012, Greenland surface ice cover melted more than at any time in 30 years of satellite observation. During that month, an estimated 97 percent of the ice sheet thawed."" His first sentence is correct. Because he also prefaced his comment by asserting that ""glaciers continue to retreat"" and the ice sheet ""provides a stark example of the rapid recession of the world's ice,"" his contention that  ""97 percent of the ice sheet thawed,"" could easily be misinterpreted as referring to the whole ice sheet",Half True,"August 5, 2013"
"The ""most realistic estimates"" for jobs created by Keystone XL are ""maybe 2,000 jobs during the construction of the pipeline.""","The Keystone XL pipeline that would carry oil from Alberta, Canada, to refineries on the Texas Gulf coast presents President Barack Obama with no easy choice. While officially, the final decision to block or approve it is in the hands of the State Department, politically, the plan pits two key Democratic constituencies against each other, environmentalists and organized labor. For the first group, extracting petroleum from Canadian tar sands is a climate change disaster. For the unions, the project means jobs. Fresh off a speech that underscored the need to restore America’s middle class, Obama talked about the steps that lie ahead for the 875-mile link between the Canadian border and a distribution hub in Nebraska. The central question, he said in an interview with the New York Times, is whether this would ""significantly contribute to carbon in our atmosphere."" As for jobs, the president went out of his way to downplay them. In the big picture, they were but a ""blip"", as the president put it. ""Republicans have said that this would be a big jobs generator. There is no evidence that that’s true,"" Obama said. ""Any reporter who is looking at the facts would take the time to confirm that the most realistic estimates are this might create maybe 2,000 jobs during the construction of the pipeline -- which might take a year or two -- and then after that we’re talking about somewhere between 50 and 100 jobs in a economy of 150 million working people."" There’s been a running battle over jobs and the Keystone XL. We’ve checked claims that it would employ as many as 20,000 workers. We rated that False; even the company behind the pipeline backed away from that number. To be clear, there are all sorts of complications when it comes to predicting how many jobs a complex, two-year project will generate. There are the direct construction jobs; there’s indirect employment at companies that provide the materials and services related to the work; and then there’s the really indirect effect that comes when money is pumped into an economy and people buy food and pay rent and so on. But out of all the numbers bruited about, the president’s seemed particularly low. We asked the White House for evidence to support the claim. All they offered was a statement from spokesman Josh Earnest during a press briefing. ""There are a range of estimates out there about the economic impact of the pipeline,"" Earnest said. ""What the president is interested in doing is draining the politics out of this debate and evaluating this project on the merits."" During the New York Times interview, the president invited reporters to use the most realistic estimates. So we went to the State Department’s lengthy environmental impact statement on the project that came out in March. In that report, the lowest estimate for jobs directly tied to construction was 3,900 jobs a year. That number came after analysts wrestled with the stop-and-start nature of construction work and converted the jobs to a yearly estimate. ""Approximately 10,000 construction workers engaged for 4-to 8-month seasonal construction periods (approximately 5,000 to 6,000 per construction period) would be required to complete the proposed project. When expressed as average annual employment, this equates to approximately 3,900 jobs."" The analysis noted that 90 percent of those jobs would come from ""a unique national labor force that is highly specialized in pipeline construction techniques."" It also confirmed that there would be few long-term jobs, something on the order of 35. The largest jobs number in the State Department report is an annual average of 42,100, but that includes part-time jobs and folds in the ripple effects as spending moves through the economy, measured over two years. The further out from the immediate project the analysis moves, the less certain the results. The report said these jobs would amount to 0.02 percent of total American employment, adding some weight to the president’s characterization of the impact on the overall jobs picture. The North American Building Trades Union said it was disappointed with Obama’s words and pressed him to let the pipeline move forward. ""So that workers and their families can share in the economic recovery he is touting,"" said union president Sean McGarvey. ""The president should look to his own State Department’s findings that there will be meaningful job creation."" We looked at the website of the Sierra Club, one of the leading environmental groups opposed to the pipeline, and they used the State Department’s 3,900 annual number. The only place we found anything close to the president’s figure was at the Cornell School of Industrial and Labor Relations Global Labor Institute. Assistant director Lara Skinner co-wrote a report highly critical of the pipeline. Skinner argued that the 3,900 covered employment for two years and that it should be divided in half. ""That's where the 2,000 job figure comes from,"" Skinner said. However, if that is what the State Department had meant, the White House could have easily referred to it to support the president’s claim. Our ruling Obama said the Keystone XL pipeline might produce about 2,000 jobs during construction, based on the most reliable estimates. The White House provided no supporting evidence and the administration’s own State Department predicted that while the pipeline would produce few permanent jobs, the construction process itself would create nearly twice as many jobs as the president said",False,"July 31, 2013"
"""Every single month since 1985 has been warmer than the historic average. All 12 of the warmest years on record have come in the last 15 years.""","U.S. Senate candidate Rush Holt set off a political firestorm last week with these three words tucked into a campaign ad about the dangers of climate change: ""Millions will die."" Holt, a Democratic congressman, defended that claim in the face of criticism from Republican U.S. Senate candidate Steve Lonegan, who dismissed Holt’s climate change assertions as ""silly hysteria."" In the Aug. 13 Democratic primary, Holt is running against Newark Mayor Cory Booker, U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone (D-6th Dist.) and Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver (D-Essex) to fill the U.S. Senate seat previously held by the late Frank Lautenberg. PolitiFact New Jersey cannot fact-check the ""millions will die"" claim -- since it’s a prediction -- but another statement made by Holt earlier in the July 22 campaign ad caught our attention. ""Every single month since 1985 has been warmer than the historic average,"" Holt (D-12th Dist.) said. ""All 12 of the warmest years on record have come in the last 15 years."" Those statements are accurate, according to data released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. First, let’s address the first part about monthly temperatures. Referring to global temperatures -- meaning land and ocean surfaces combined -- Jessica Blunden, a climate scientist with the NOAA, confirmed in a series of e-mails that ""since February 1985, every month has been warmer than the average of that month."" The NOAA compares each month’s global temperature against the average for that respective month for the period between 1901 and 2000, Blunden said. Since February 1985, the global temperature for every month has been above its 20th Century average, she said. For instance, the NOAA found that the global temperature in June was 1.15 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the average of all the months of June between 1901 and 2000. That measurement marked ""the 37th consecutive June and 340th consecutive month—that’s a total of more than 28 years—with a global temperature above the 20th-century average,"" according to a summary of the NOAA’s latest climate report. On the second point, it turns out that Holt's figure of the 12 warmest years on record occurring in the last 15 years was actually a conservative estimate. Based on NOAA data, the last 15 years -- from 1998 to 2012 -- have included the 14 hottest years on record since 1880 for global temperatures. The NOAA estimates that the hottest year was 2010. Using a different methodology, NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies estimates that the last 15 years have included the 13 hottest years since 1880 for global temperatures. In a statistical tie, either 2010 or 2005 may be considered the warmest year on record, according to Reto Ruedy, a climate scientist with the institute. The institute has said 2012 was the ninth warmest year on record, while the NOAA estimates that 2012 was the tenth hottest year. ""The record dates back to 1880 because that is when there were enough meteorological stations around the world to provide global temperature data,"" according to a news release on the institute’s website. Our ruling In a campaign ad where he claimed ""millions will die"" from climate change, Holt cited two statistics about monthly and annual global temperatures. ""Every single month since 1985 has been warmer than the historic average,"" Holt said. ""All 12 of the warmest years on record have come in the last 15 years."" Both of those statistics are backed up by data released by scientists at the NOAA and NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. The global temperature in every month since February 1985 has been above the 20th Century average for its respective month, according to the NOAA. As for the warmest years on record, NOAA scientists estimate that the last 15 years have included the 14 hottest years and NASA scientists have said that same time period included the 13 hottest years",True,"July 28, 2013"
"The ocean is now ""much more acidic . . . than it has been for many millions of years.""","Former Vice President Al Gore, now a crusader against climate change, argues that the continued release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is going to do more than just raise temperatures. It's going to alter the balance of sea life by changing the acidity of the oceans. During a June 11 keynote address at U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse's 4th Annual Rhode Island Energy & Environmental Leaders Day, Gore said ocean acidification has been characterized as the evil twin of global warming. The process ""disrupts ocean chemistry,"" he said. Ocean water is still more base than acid on the pH scale, ""but it's much more acidic, more than it has been for many millions of years."" That's important, he said, because, ""This disrupts the process by which shells are formed, not only for shellfish but also for the little critters, the zooplankton, the little tiny critters at the base of the ocean food chain. They have little thin shells. That's being disrupted now."" On Sunday, we checked a similar claim from Whitehouse, who said the acidity of the oceans had increased 30 percent since the industrial age. We ruled that Mostly True. We were equally interested in Gore's assessment of the problem over a much longer span. Is the ocean currently ""much more acidic"" than it has been for ""many millions of years?"" As we outlined in our examination of Whitehouse’s claim, acidity is measured on the pH scale. The lower the number, the greater the acid level. Currently, the oceans have a pH of about 8.1. That's more acidic than it was before the Industrial Revolution, when the level was 8.2. When we contacted Gore's office, spokeswoman Betsy McManus directed us to an ocean acidification fact sheet from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. She highlighted this statement, which starts out by describing that scientists measure ocean pH in ancient times by using telltale chemical signatures in tiny creatures buried in ocean sediment: ""Additional geochemical evidence and modeling provide strong evidence that the average surface ocean pH has not been much lower than about 8.2 for millions of years."" That seems far less extreme than Gore's statement that the ocean is much more acidic than it has been for many millions of years. So we contacted several oceanographers to get data from the geologic record, where ocean pH is inferred from a variety of methods using cores taken from ancient ice and deep sea sediment. Just as you can get different temperature readings at the same time if you have thermometers in different locations, the pH measurements in any particular era and from cores taken from different locations can vary. If you look at individual data points, you don't have to go back ""many millions of years"" to find ocean levels as acidic as today. A 2009 study in the journal Science that went back 2.1 million years by analyzing the shells of single-celled plankton buried off the west coast of Africa, found that while the pH averaged around 8.2 during that period, there were a few points -- 100,000 and 900,000 years ago -- when the surface ocean pH hit 8.1, where it is today. But Barbel Honisch, a geochemist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and chief author of the Science paper, cautioned that ""the uncertainty in the data points is very large."" She said she has more confidence in data published a year later in Earth and Planetary Science Letters, which went back five million years, because it dovetails with other evidence. That study suggested that pH levels dropped to between 8.0 and 8.1 about 3 million to 4 million years ago. ""If you go back 4 million years, you're there,"" Honisch said, adding that other data support that conclusion as well. ""The ocean was more acidic or just as acidic as it is now."" Again, that's not ""many millions of years."" Acid levels also seemed to rise to today's level around 15 million to 16 million years ago, according to Honisch. And Andrew Dickson, an oceanographer at the University of California San Diego, said, ""Once we go back beyond about 23 million years, the average surface ocean pH is lower than today,"" he said. Another Science paper by Honisch and her colleagues, this one from 2012, looked at a broad array of evidence in 10-million-year blocks. Beginning 10 million years ago, acid levels gradually grew until the pH dropped to about 7.5 110 million years ago. That's five times more acidic than today's oceans. The climate experts we spoke with stressed that it's important to put this in perspective. Changes in pH typically occur over millions of years, giving life forms -- whose biology can be thrown akilter by a small change in pH -- time to adapt. Scientists fear that today's shift will come so rapidly, organisms won't be able to compensate, and many species will simply die off. It would have been more accurate to say, said Honisch, ""The ocean is acidifying faster today than it has in millions of years."" Our ruling Former Vice President Al Gore said the ocean today ""is much more acidic, more than it has been for many millions of years."" It's clear that the ocean is more acidic than it was before the Industrial Revolution. It's also clear that many millions of years ago it was much more acidic. But the best estimates suggest that the oceans reached levels of acidity comparable to today’s levels sometime between about 900,000 years ago and 3 million to 4 million years ago -- far more recently than the ""many millions of years"" ago that Gore suggested. ""If I had one of your meters, this would be halfway up,"" said Dickson, one of our experts on ocean acidification",Half True,"July 22, 2013"
"The oceans ""have become 30 percent more acidic.""","Most people have heard about what will happen if humans keep pumping large amounts of carbon dioxide into the air as we burn more fossil fuels, including warmer temperatures, melting polar caps, rising sea levels, stronger storms and big changes in the types of plants and animals that can survive and thrive in particular regions of the world. ""But wait,"" as an evil TV pitchman might gleefully declare, ""there's more."" On June 12, 2013, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, took to floor of the Senate for one of his regular speeches about the impact of pollution on Earth's climate. This time he focused on a lesser-publicized problem -- the oceans are becoming more acidic. ""Our oceans face unprecedented challenges from climate change and carbon pollution,"" he said. ""Oceans have absorbed more than 550 billion tons of our carbon pollution. As a result, they have become 30 percent more acidic. That is a measurement. That is not a theory."" Thirty percent more acidic? Our first question was: ""Is it true?"" Our second was: ""If so, what does that mean?"" When most people think of measuring acidity, they think of pH, the scale that runs from 0 to 14. (Think back to your school days and the little strips of paper that changed color depending on whether a substance was an acid or a base.) ""So,"" you might ask, ""has the pH of the ocean shifted a few points?"" Not at all. The pH scale is not a straight-line measure like a yardstick. It's a logarithmic scale, where a one point drop would make a substance 10 times more acidic. (What you're really measuring is the number of hydrogen ions, which determine how acidic something is.) Whitehouse's office directed us to several sources -- and we found our own -- reporting that since the mid-18th century, when air pollution became more prevalent, the pH of surface seawater has gone from about 8.2 to about 8.1. (That's a rise in acidity, but sea water would have to drop below 7.0 before it could be officially classified as an acid.) Lowering the pH by a tenth of a point translates to a 26-percent rise in hydrogen ion concentration, but some of those science sources say the increase is actually closer to 30 percent. The pH scale has been around only since 1909. How do we know what the pH was like in the 1800s or earlier? The oceanographers we consulted told us basic chemistry provides the answer. Seawater absorbs air, including carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide interacts with the water to make the ocean more acidic. Researchers have good measurements directly comparing carbon dioxide and pH dating to 1989. They show that surface ocean acidity has risen as carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have risen, just as expected. To go further back in time, scientists have measured the carbon dioxide concentrations in tiny bubbles of air trapped in ice found in places such as Greenland and Antarctica. Those ice cores show that, until the 1850s, the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere had not risen above 280 parts per million for most of the last million years or so. But in the past century and a half, they’ve been rising steadily, causing an increase in ocean acidity. Today, those carbon dioxide levels have occasionally passed 400 parts per million. ""It's been mostly in the last 100 years,"" said Steve D'Hondt, an oceanography professor at the University of Rhode Island. One other point. The acidity of the entire ocean hasn't changed by the amount Whitehouse citied. The chemical composition of deeper layers shifts much more gradually. ""It's been a long time since the deep ocean touched the atmosphere,"" said Andrew Dickson of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, at the University of California-San Diego. ""So it's not true of the ocean as a whole. It's only true of the surface layer."" That leads us to our second question: what does it mean? Because the effects of acidification are currently restricted to the upper 600-1,600 feet of the ocean, where most of the life is found, there's serious concern that small changes in pH will have a big -- and not very healthy -- effect on many ocean species, although some may be unaffected. Earth's oceans have been much more acidic in the past -- 110 million years ago the oceans were 400 percent (five times) more acidic. But most of those changes developed over millions of years, giving organisms time to evolve and adapt to the shift. The current rise in acidity is rapid. Said University of Rhode Island oceanographer Arthur Spivack, ""We already have a measurable change in ocean pH and we're going into a period where there will be a substantial change."" Our ruling U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said the oceans ""have become 30 percent more acidic."" He is correct if you look at the increase in the concentration of hydrogen ions since the 1850s in the upper layers of the ocean, where most sea life thrives. We also note that he's describing the change using a measure that heightens the drama for the casual listener. But regardless of how it is characterized, that change is cause for concern if it harms ocean creatures sensitive to changes in pH. On the other hand, the deeper ocean has not seen a 30-percent increase",Mostly True,"July 21, 2013"
"""Texas ranks: #1 in worker deaths, #1 carbon emissions, #50 in high school graduates, #50 in funding for mental health patients.""","A ""Rick Perry 2016"" image popped up on Facebook accompanied by warnings about the state he’s led since late 2000: ""Texas ranks: #1 in worker deaths, #1 carbon emissions, #50 in high school graduates, #50 in funding for mental health patients."" The June 13, 2013, post by the Everlasting GOP Stoppers, which also has a web page highlighting political items, was accompanied by a message signed ""Veruca"": ""True. Google it."" Referring to the Republican governor’s possibly renewed presidential aspirations, the comment closed: ""Just think if he makes good on his threat to run again, he can do for the whole country what he's done for Texas."" Mindful that we’ve previously explored claims about each of these topics, we asked the Everlasting GOP Stoppers, whose posts play off of the novel and movie ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" how it reached its Texas rankings. Worker deaths ""Veruca Salt"" (who did not provide her real name), a co-founder of the group, replied via Facebook message and pointed out an April 1, 2013, commentary by a state legislator, a Sept. 15, 2012, Dallas Morning News news article and a Sept. 21, 2011, news release from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, each of them indicating that in 2010, Texas was tops in some kind of worker fatalities. The commentary by Rep. Armando Walle, D-Houston, said: ""Texas still leads the country in the rate of construction worker fatalities."" The Sept. 15, 2012, News’ story said that Texas led the nation with 461 total worker deaths in 2010, a tally attributed to the bureau, whose news release said Texas had 456 ""fatal work injuries"" in 2010, according to a preliminary count, which was down 26 from 2009. Some 134 of the deaths were highway-related, according to the release, with workplace homicides and falls accounting for 48 and 45 deaths, respectively. The release does not say Texas led the nation in workplace deaths. In May 2013, we rated as Half True a claim that Texas leads the nation in fatal industrial accidents. Drawing on statistics compiled by the federal bureau, we found that according to preliminary figures for 2011, Texas ranked No. 1 in five of six types of event or exposure tabbed by Austin advocate Jim Marston as  ""industrial accident categories"" plus the transportation category. California led in deaths caused by violence and other injuries by persons or animals. Texas, the nation’s second-most populous state, had 18 of the nation’s 143 work fatalities attributed to fires and explosions; 67 of the total 666 from falls, slips and trips; 43 of the 401 caused by exposure to harmful substances or environments; and 66 of 708 deaths resulting from contact with objects and other equipment. California had the second-most in each of the four categories: 9, 60, 36 and 50 deaths, respectively. Third in fires/explosions was Tennessee with 10; third in falls and slips was New York with 39; third in harmful exposure was Florida with 27; and New York was third in object/equipment contact deaths at 34. We looked at preliminary data for 2003 through 2010 and found Texas led those categories about 88 percent of the time. Seeking a way to account for population differences among states, we took each state’s 2011 raw numbers of deaths in the four categories Marston tabbed, added them together, then divided by the average number of workers employed in the state in 2011 per the bureau. Texas ranked 18th, with a rate of 1.7 such deaths per 100,000 workers. Observing that the five states with the ""worst"" rates all employed fewer than 1 million people in 2011, we checked to see how Texas fared among states employing more than 1 million. The answer: 10th place. ""Worst"" among the states were Montana (3.4 deaths per 100,000 workers), North Dakota (3.3), West Virginia (3), Alaska (3) and New Mexico (2.8). ""Worst"" among states with more than 1 million employed were Arkansas (2.6), Louisiana (2.3), Kansas (2.3), Missouri (2.1) and Kentucky (2). During our look into the Everlasting GOP Stoppers’ claim, a bureau spokeswoman, Cheryl Abbot, responded to our inquiry about worker deaths in general by emailing us a federal document showing 2011 workplace fatality rates state by state. That year, according to the document, Texas had a rate of 4 fatal occupational injuries per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers. That tied the state for 22nd with Alabama. North Dakota ranked first with a fatality rate of 12.4, according to the document, with Wyoming second (11.6) followed by Montana (11.2), Alaska (11.1), Arkansas (8.0), South Dakota (6.7) and New Mexico (6.6). Among the 10 most populous states, Texas ranked second to Ohio, which had a 5.5 fatality rate, according to the document. Carbon emissions ""Salt"" pointed us toward a May 14, 2013, blog post in a trade publication, Environmental Leader, stating: ""Texas still led the U.S. states in CO2 emissions from energy with 663 million metric tons in 2010, followed by California and Pennsylvania."" The post, like a May 29, 2013, online post by the Environmental Defense Fund, attributed the conclusion to figures posted by the federal Energy Information Administration. The post said too, however, that Wyoming had the nation’s greatest per-resident emissions, 118.5 metric tons per capita. In February 2013, we found a similar contrast; by far, Texas topped other states in carbon emissions except when those emissions were adjusted for population. A Jan. 12, 2012, Houston Chronicle news article said that according to federal data released that day, Texas was releasing far more greenhouse gases into the air than any other state. The story continued: ""Texas' coal-fired power plants and oil refineries generated 294 million tons of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases in 2010, more than the next two states – Pennsylvania and Florida – combined, the data show."" The story said the Environmental Protection Agency released the data from the largest industrial sources across the country for the first time as part of a broader effort to reduce emissions linked to global warming. It said the agency ""collected data from more than 6,700 industrial facilities that release at least 25,000 tons of greenhouse gases into the air a year. The threshold is comparable to the emissions from burning 131 railcars of coal, the EPA said.""   To our inquiries at that time, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the Sierra Club in Texas each guided us to even more recent EPA data on industrial emissions of greenhouse gases, the primary driver of climate change, the federal agency says. And on the agency’s website, it’s possible to check on each state’s industrial emissions of eight gases, among them carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons. According to the posted information, Texas industrial facilities in 2011 emitted 391 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, mainly produced from the burning of fossil fuels. The database indicates that industrial CO2 emissions in other populous states were lower: California (95 million metric tons); New York (44); Florida (123); Illinois (41); Pennsylvania (141): Ohio (142); Michigan (89); Georgia (82); North Carolina (66); and New Jersey (23). Louisiana, on the Gulf Coast like Texas, had 132 million metric tons of CO2 emissions, according to the agency. It’s no surprise, perhaps, that Texas plants make the state No. 1 in industrial carbon dioxide emissions. Neil Carman, who directs the Clean Air program for the Sierra Club’s Lone Star chapter, told us by email: ""Realize that Texas has more large oil refineries, major chemical and petrochemical plants, hundreds of natural gas processing plants, Portland cement kilns, carbon black plants, etc. than any other state because of the strength of the oil & gas industry and the large geographical size and population base as well."" Carman’s comment underscored a hitch in the federal information. The data does not reflect total gases emitted in each state--just those attributed to industrial facilities. Yet Al Armendariz of the Sierra Club guided us to a spreadsheet prepared by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, based on its analysis of emissions from the consumption of fossil fuels, estimating that in 2010, Texas had 653 million metric tons of CO2 emissions. California placed a distant second, at 370 million metric tons, and Pennsylvania was third, at 257 million metric tons. So, Texas has been No. 1 in total CO2 emissions, though it would have tied for 13th if each state’s emissions were adjusted for its population.In per-capita emissions, less populous states led the nation, topped by Wyoming (108 metric tons per capita); North Dakota (76); Alaska (56); Louisiana (50); Montana (36); Kentucky (35); Indiana (34); Iowa (30); Alabama and New Mexico (28); Nebraska and Oklahoma (27). Kansas and Texas each had 26 metric tons of CO2 emissions per resident. High school graduates On Texas ranking last in high school graduates, ""Salt"" cited the March 2013 edition of a report by a Texas House caucus, the Legislative Study Group, on how Texas ranks compared to other states. ""Texas is dead last in percentage of high school graduates,"" the report said, a conclusion attributed to the ""Texas Fact Book"" published in 2012 by the Legislative Budget Board, which said that in 2009, 79.9 percent of Texans had graduated from high school, placing the state 50th. By email, a staff spokesman for the budget board, John Barton, told us that ranking was based on the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2009 American Community Survey, which indicates Texas trailed Mississippi, at 80.4 percent, and California, 80.6 percent. More up-to-date information was available before the group made its post about Perry. In the bureau’s 2011 survey, Texas, Mississippi and California tied for last among the states, with 81.1 percent of adults having high school degrees. Louisiana was fourth, at 82.5 percent. We suppose the group’s Facebook post could be read as saying Texas is last in current high school graduation rates. That was not what we found in January 2013 when we rated as Mostly True a Perry claim that Texas graduation rates were at an all-time high and third-highest in the nation. Texas had tied with five states for the third-highest graduation rate in 2011, of 86 percent, we found. Then again, three states had higher rates, meaning Texas might better be described as fourth-ranked. Also, by another measure, comparing the number of graduates one year to students in ninth grade four years earlier, Texas remained among middling states for 2009-10, with a 79 percent completion rate. Mental health spending ""Salt"" offered news articles and blog posts from 2011 and 2012 indicating Texas ranked 50th in per-resident spending on mental health care. Most drew on an annual analysis by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. In February 2013, we rated as Mostly True a claim that Texas is ""last in mental health expenditures,"" after noting that the foundation’s latest review indicated that another state spent less per resident than Texas in fiscal 2010, which in Texas ran through August 2010. Texas was last among the states in such per-capita spending in 2009, 2008 and 2007, according to Kaiser charts for those years, though the 2007 chart shows no available data for Hawaii. The latest comparison: In fiscal 2010, which in Texas ran through August 2010, Texas spent nearly $980 million total on mental health services, placing ninth nationally, according to a foundation chart. The state’s per-person spending of $38.99 placed the state 49th -- not last -- among the states. Idaho, with per-capita spending of $36.64, was 50th, with Maine No. 1 at per-capita spending of $346.92. The national average was $120.56. In raw dollars, then, Texas spent more on mental health services than 41 states. But in per-resident spending -- the better metric for comparing states --Texas ranked second-to-last to Idaho after trailing all other states for several years. Our ruling The Facebook post said: ""Texas ranks: #1 in worker deaths, #1 carbon emissions, #50 in high school graduates, #50 in funding for mental health patients."" This post takes things out of context by cherry-picking figures, in each case stressing the result that makes Texas look worst. Still, two of the declared ranks seem fairly solid. Texas tied with Mississippi in 2011 for the greatest share of adults lacking high school degrees and it was second to last in per-person mental health spending in 2010. In contrast, Texas ranked 22nd nationally in its 2011 worker fatality rate and while the state had the most carbon emissions in 2010, it would have tied for 13th if each state’s emissions were adjusted for its population",Half True,"July 19, 2013"
"Miami-Dade has ""the nation’s highest-rated tap water.""","
Miami-Dade has plenty to brag about: stellar beaches, celebrities who live in multimillion dollar mansions, four-star restaurants, the world famous tennis tournament on Key Biscayne and the national basketball champions the Miami Heat. 
But a county document boasted about something far more ordinary when Mayor Carlos Gimenez released his budget proposal July 9. A budget-in-brief document written by the county’s Office of Management and Budget stated that the county has ""the nation’s highest-rated tap water."" 
Do we have some sort of liquid gold pouring out of our faucets that is the envy of other counties nationwide? We went in search of answers to quench our curiosity. 
Miami-Dade has long promoted tap water 
First, let’s wade into the surprisingly controversial history of Miami-Dade county government talking up tap water. 
In 2008, the county landed in hot water after it aired radio ads that boasted its tap water was better than bottled water. 
Nestle Waters North America, which makes nearly $4 billion a year selling Zephyrhills and other brands, threatened to sue, the Miami Herald wrote. (It never did sue, a county spokeswoman told PolitiFact.) 
The county continued to promote tap water, including a mock boxing match video between tap water and bottled water, a love song jingle ""Miami-Dade tap water your No. 1!"" and a video of a young cowboy asking Mom, ""Howdy M'am? What do you have on tap?"" She replied, ""For you partner, I’ve got the original tap."" 
Miami-Dade’s explanation 
We asked a Miami-Dade county spokeswoman to explain the source of the claim that the county has the ""nation’s highest-rated tap water."" 
We sensed some research percolating at Miami-Dade County Hall as spokespersons sent us emails saying we’d get an answer soon. 
A few hours later, we had a reply: ""It’s a scrivener’s error,"" said Jennifer L. Messemer, a spokeswoman in Miami-Dade’s water and sewer department. 
Budget director Jennifer Moon told us in an email that ""we compile input from the various departments to put in the budget-in-brief. We realized yesterday that we inadvertently left out 'one of' in the statement regarding the highest rated water. We will correct this online and in future prints."" 
(At PolitiFact we give props when someone fesses up to an error, but we continue our fact-check anyway.) 
The error was in a document written by the budget department, according to Messemer. We did not find the same claim in other water-related documents. The full chapter on the water and sewer department’s budget proposal merely refers to the water as ""high-quality drinking water."" (It also mentions an upcoming $1.6 billion projected to fix environmental violations from failing wastewater infrastructure.) 
The annual water quality report states that the water ""is delicious and meets and exceeds all local, state and federal guidelines. So drink up with confidence!"" 
The county has received some kudos for water quality. 
Messemer pointed to a 2008 Forbes.com’s Top 10 list of ""Best Cities for Clean Drinking Water."" The article, which ranked the Miami/Fort Lauderdale area fourth, was based on a 2007 water quality study compiled by University of Cincinnati researchers. (The report was sponsored by Proctor & Gamble.) 
We found the most comprehensive water quality comparison in an analysis by the Environmental Working Group, a research and advocacy organization that says the federal government’s standards for water quality fall short. 
The group spent three years analyzing water contaminant data nationwide and found 316 contaminants. The EPA has enforceable standards for less than half of them. 
Released in 2009, the database evaluated water utilities based on the total number of chemicals detected, the percentage of chemicals found of those tested; and the highest average level for a pollutant relative to legal limits or national averages. The analysis included the most common pollutants such as disinfection byproducts, nitrate and arsenic. 
The group published a ranking of large cities, and Miami came in 46th place out of 100. (Several other large Florida cities or counties were listed, including Odessa, which is served by the St. Petersburg Water Resources Department, 20th; Pinellas County, 57th; Hillsborough County, 65th and Tampa, 68th.) You can read about government officials pushing back against the report in the Miami Herald. 
Our ruling 
A Miami-Dade County budget document claimed that the county has ""the nation’s highest-rated tap water."" 
A county spokeswoman said that statement was an error. The water department more typically talks about the ""high quality"" of the water without making a national comparison. 
An article in Forbes concluded the Miami/Fort Lauderdale area was fourth in water quality based on a 2007 University of Cincinnati study of 12 contaminants. A more thorough national analysis by the Environmental Working Group ranked Miami-Dade County at 46th in 2009",False Pants on Fire,"July 12, 2013"
"""About 95 percent of (Ohio’s) electricity comes from burning coal.""","
President Barack Obama, declaring that ""Americans across the country are already paying the price of inaction"" on climate change, announced sweeping measures on June 25 to reduce greenhouse gas pollution. 
He said he would use executive power to require reductions in the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the nation’s power plants, as the centerpiece in a three-part plan that includes new federal funds to advance renewable energy technology, and spending to protect cities and states from the ravages of storms and droughts aggravated by a changing climate. 
Republicans led by House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio were quick to condemn the measures, saying they constituted government overreach that would constrict energy production and strangle the nation’s economic recovery. 
""The president’s policies are not helping the economy, they’re making it worse,"" Boehner said in a news conference. 
He said the policies would have the effect of ""increasing the cost of electricity – especially in a state like mine, in Ohio, where about 95 percent of our electricity comes from burning coal."" 
That figure caught PolitiFact Ohio's attention. We asked Boehner's staff for a source to back it up. 
They did not have a source for the figure, but Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said: ""Regardless, it’s clear the overwhelming majority of electricity in Ohio comes from the coal that the president is attacking."" 
In support of that statement, he cited a Washington Post article that looked at the question of whether Obama was waging a ""war on coal."" 
So how much of Ohio's electricity does come from coal? 
The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) has a feature on its website that asks and answers the question. 
""Coal, a nonrenewable fossil fuel, is used to generate 77.87 percent of the electricity in Ohio,"" the PUCO site says. 
PUCO says about 11 percent of Ohio electricity is generated by nuclear power, about 9.1 percent is produced using natural gas and other gases, and petroleum is burned to create steam to turn the turbine blades that generate about 1.0 percent of Ohio electricity. (PUCO lists as its source the Edison Electric Institute, EEI, the association of U.S. shareholder-owned electric companies.) 
The U.S. Energy Information Administration rounds the figure to 78 percent for electricity generated by coal. 
That percentage is far higher than the 42 percent of electricity generated by coal nationally, according to the EIA. 
Our colleagues at the Washington Post Fact Checker also examined Boehner's statement. In addition to citing the figures from PUCO, they noted that the latest figures show that Ohio cut its net generation of electricity from coal by about 10 percent from 2010 to 2011. 
Fact Checker also took note of Ohio law, cited by the PUCO and Energy Information Administration, that is designed to reduce reliance on coal by requiring that at least 25 percent of all electricity sold in the state come from alternative energy sources by 2025. Half of that must come from renewable sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric power, geothermal and biomass. 
Boehner's overall point was correct. As his spokesman said, the vast majority of Ohio's electricity does come from coal, and the percentage is far higher than the national average. 
But the state officially is looking to reduce, not maintain, its reliance on coal, and has made progress in the effort. 
And while the percentage of electricity from coal is high, Boehner's figure of 95 percent exaggerates it by 17 percentage points. That's a significant difference",Half True,"July 5, 2013"
"In South Florida, ""we've had nine inches of sea-level rise since the 1920s.""","
Not long after President Barack Obama gave a speech outlining his plan for attacking climate change, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., appeared on Fox News to discuss the future of energy and the environment. 
""We've had nine inches of sea-level rise since the 1920s,"" said Wasserman Schultz in a June 28, 2013, interview with Tucker Carlson. ""What that means is that communities like mine in South Florida and coastal communities all across the country are facing dangerous sea-level rise, which will ultimately cause homes to be under water in just a few short years."" 
In this item, we won’t analyze her projections for future sea-level rises; such estimates are based on a variety of theoretical models and come with lots of uncertainty attached. However, we did wonder whether Wasserman Schultz was correct about past changes -- specifically, whether South Florida has ""had nine inches of sea-level rise since the 1920s."" 
First, some background on sea-level rises. ""Sea level"" refers to the height of the ocean’s surface as measured either by a mechanical tide gauge (a method used since the 19th century) or, since the late 1990s, by satellite measurements. The kind of changes Wasserman Schultz mentioned are not short-term changes such as high tide and low tide, but rather average sea-level measurements taken over the course of many years. 
We located sea level data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for a variety of locations, including Miami Beach, Fla. Using tide gauge data from 1931 to 1981, NOAA found a change equivalent to 0.78 feet in 100 years. That's roughly nine inches since the 1920s. 
We checked with two scientists who specialize in sea-level measurements -- Gary B Griggs, director of the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of California-Santa Cruz, and Gary Mitchum, a physical oceanographer at the University of South Florida -- and both agreed that the NOAA data was an appropriate source for Wasserman Schultz to rely on. Both scientists considered her claim to be accurate. 
We will, however, offer two notes of caution when thinking about sea-level rise. 
One complication for making these measurements is that the land-based reference point for a tide gauge is not as fixed as it would seem to the naked eye. In reality, the land itself may be rising or falling, masking changes in sea level. 
For instance, in some places, such as Alaska or Scandinavia, the land is rising because it’s still rebounding from the retreat of heavy glaciers. In other locations, the slow action of plate tectonics is pushing the land upwards. The effect of land rises can be strong: In places like Alaska, the rise in the land has been faster than the rise in sea level, meaning that sea level is actually dropping in relative terms. 
By contrast, in Louisiana, the land is sinking due to a variety of landscape changes made by humans. With sea levels rising and the land sinking, the relative change in sea level is especially dramatic. 
South Florida fits somewhere between these two extremes. But because of the variability in land rise from place to place, it’s not appropriate to assume that just because sea level has risen by nine inches in Miami Beach that it has risen by the same amount everywhere. 
The second caveat is that past changes in sea level are a whole lot clearer than future changes. 
In a 2011 paper, Mitchum estimated that sea level in South Florida would rise 32 inches by 2100, with a smaller possibility of a 40-inch rise. However, other estimates have varied, and Mitchum cautions against assigning too much certainty to long-term estimates of sea-level rise. 
Our ruling 
Wasserman Schultz said that in South Florida, ""we've had nine inches of sea-level rise since the 1920s."" That essentially matches the data collected by the National Oceantic and Atmospheric Administration. While there is considerable uncertainty about the future course of sea-level rises, Wasserman Schultz’s estimate of the historical rise appears to be on target",True,"July 3, 2013"
"Recent record-low water levels in Lake Michigan are evidence that global warming is leading to ""the evaporation of our Great Lakes.""","On the same day that President Barack Obama gave a major address on climate change, the second-ranking Senate Democrat, Dick Durbin of Illinois, gave a floor speech that drove the issue home for his constituents. ""I believe the environment is a challenge we must face head on,"" Durbin said on June 25, 2013. ""To ignore it is to ignore reality. Lake Michigan, when measured just a few months ago, was at its lowest depth in any measured time in recent history. What we are seeing in global warming is the evaporation of our Great Lakes."" A reader suggested we check out Durbin’s claim, so we will. The Great Lakes take in water through precipitation, runoff and inflow from upstream bodies of water; they lose it from evaporation or diversion. Both seasonal and longer-term cycles have caused fluctuations since the end of the Ice Age. Over the past 150 years, scientists say, water levels have varied within a relatively narrow, 2-meter range. But the past few decades have produced some important patterns. Lake levels were relatively high from the 1970s to the late 1990s, then fell swiftly in the late 1990s before settling in at a low, but fairly stable, level through today. Durbin is correct that water levels in Lake Michigan were lower in January 2013 than at any time since records began in 1918 -- a full 6 feet lower than the 1986 peak. This is causing worries about wildlife, shipping, recreation and tourism. Several factors tend to increase water loss: • Dredging. The removal of soil and rock to enable ships to pass can encourage lower water levels. Dredging projects going back to the 19th century are estimated to have lowered Lake Michigan by 16 inches, according to the International Joint Commission, a U.S.-Canada panel on boundary issues. • Erosion. Natural erosion since 1962 may have lowered water levels by an additional 3 to 5 inches, according to the commission. • Diversion. A diversion of Lake Michigan water to Chicago starting in 1900 is estimated to have lowered water levels by about 2 inches, but this has been more than balanced out by two diversions into Lake Superior, which feeds Lake Michigan. Dredging, erosion and diversion have affected today’s low levels by reducing the baseline level, but because there have been no major dredging projects in recent years, these factors have not contributed to recent fluctuations. Other factors more directly related to climate change, however, may have, specifically: • Low precipitation. In 2011 and 2012, the basin feeding the Great Lakes experienced mild winters, which produced lower-than-normal snowpacks, reducing a major source of incoming water in the spring. Dry summers can also provide too little incoming rain to keep levels high. • Higher evaporation. If it’s hot in the summer, water temperatures increase. Then, when cool, dry air comes in the fall, the lakes’ warmer water evaporates in greater quantities, lowering water levels. This can be exaggerated if precipitation levels are already low. Such conditions prevailed last year. • More limited ice cover. In winter, diminished ice cover can mean higher water temperatures, which in turn encourages evaporation. A 2012 study found that the Great Lakes have lost 71 percent of their ice cover since 1973. However, it gets complicated: Scientists say that greater evaporation in the fall can cool lakes, potentially increasing ice coverage the following winter. Durbin’s office pointed to these factors as support for the senator’s claim. ""Warmer weather, more severe droughts, higher water temperatures and greater evaporation are, in fact, leading to lower water levels,"" said Max Gleischman, a spokesman for Durbin. ""The lake has seen record-low water levels in recent years at the same time we’ve seen record drought conditions in the region. While temperature, water level and drought conditions have fluctuated over the years, the highs are getting higher and the lows are getting lower."" However, scientists we interviewed say Durbin’s claim is an oversimplification. ""Attribution of low lake levels to human-caused climate change is rather speculative at this time,"" said Brent M. Lofgren, a climatologist at the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Lofgren said it’s important to look at the pivotal period in the late 1990s. Levels declined suddenly, he said, and since then, have remained fairly steady. The record lows of early 2013, he said, amounted to ""a small downward excursion from the levels over the last decade and a half."" In fact, after hitting the low point, Lake Michigan saw a 9-inch rise in April -- the second highest monthly increase for April on record. In other words, the water level is still low, but it’s fluctuating, and it’s in roughly the same range it’s been since the late 1990s. This pattern of events doesn’t fit very well with existing models of global warming, which suppose a gradual rise in greenhouse gases, Lofgren said. A sudden change like the one experienced in the late 1990s -- followed by a decade and a half of fairly stable levels -- ""is particularly difficult to attribute to a gradual buildup of greenhouse gases,"" he said. In the meantime, Lofgren said, the modeling of how climate change could affect the Great Lakes in the future has recently undergone a rethinking. A new model developed by Lofgren for how climate changes affect the Great Lakes basin suggests potential water-level declines smaller than previous estimates. The previous consensus for Lake Michigan was a decline of between 10 and 44 inches. The new model suggests anywhere from a decline of 36 inches to a rise of 20 inches, and another recent study indicated losses of 24 inches or less. Why such a wide range of outcomes? It boils down to complexity. Both a 2012 study by the International Joint Commission and the Great Lakes Environmental Assessment and Mapping Project, an independent group, agreed that lower water levels are likelier in the future than higher levels, but they added that varying models leave considerable uncertainty about which outcome will result. ""Although climate experts expect evaporation to increase in the future, there is debate over whether or not the Great Lakes would see more precipitation under future climate change scenarios,"" said John Allis, chief of the Great Lakes Hydraulics and Hydrology Office at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Detroit district. Our ruling Durbin pointed to recent record-low water levels in Lake Michigan as evidence that global warming is leading to ""the evaporation of our Great Lakes."" Most scientists agree that recent patterns of precipitation, evaporation and ice cover suggest that climate change is affecting water levels in the Great Lakes. But over the long term, dredging and erosion have lowered water levels, and the sudden decline in the late 1990s, followed by a relatively stable decade and a half, doesn’t mesh with the presumed slow buildup of greenhouse gases. In addition, scientific models offer a wide range of possible impacts on water levels due to climate change, from decreases to increases",Half True,"June 28, 2013"
Says Delaware County has more waterfront property than any other county in the state of Ohio,"
Ohio’s northern shore along Lake Erie provides a coastal connection to the Great Lakes, a series of inland seas that collectively hold the greatest supply of freshwater in the world. 
So it got PolitiFact Ohio’s curiosity going when we heard a claim that state Sen. Kris Jordan, a Republican from Delaware County, made during budget debates in the Ohio Senate. 
""Delaware County actually has more lakefront property and waterfront property than any other county in the state of Ohio,"" Jordan said. 
PolitiFact Ohio decided to see if Jordan’s claim held water. 
After all, Ohio’s north shore stretches hundreds of miles through eight different counties.  Delaware County, meanwhile, is landlocked in the center of the state. 
First, let’s put Jordan’s remark in context. 
The senator made his claim while speaking in support of some provisions in the budget bill that targeted the city of Columbus. 
Columbus maintains a buffer strip around two reservoirs that extend into Delaware County, and Jordan’s district, and supply water to the city. Adjacent property owners have, in the past, clashed with the city over use of the buffer strips. Some, for example, have been cited for mowing grasses that the city says help with filtration of runoff water that enters the reservoir. 
The budget bill included restrictions to bar the city from penalizing property owners for doing what Jordan described as ""basic maintenance of their property."" He urged they be left in the legislation. 
Those reservoirs are part of the reason Delaware County has the most shoreline, Jordan said. 
PolitiFact Ohio checked with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources to see what data it could provide. 
It has a website link with information about the Lake Erie shoreline that includes mileage for each of eight counties -- Ashtabula, Cuyahoga, Erie, Lake, Lorain, Lucas, Ottawa and Sandusky. 
Ottawa County, which includes most of the Lake Erie islands, has the most lakefront property among those eight, with total shoreline of 94 miles. Next was Erie County with 68 miles. Sandusky County had the least among the eight with just 13 miles of lakeshore. 
But Ottawa’s shoreline wasn’t nearly the greatest in Ohio. 
ODNR experts from the Division of Coastal Management and Division of Soil and Water Resources used data from geographic information systems to calculate shorelines for Ohio’s other counties, coming up with estimates that took into account waterfront along inland lakes and waterways. 
Ottawa cracked the top five at No. 4. The others in the top five are inland counties that are home to large lakes or reservoirs. 
And Delaware was indeed No. 1. It has about 140 miles of shoreline, according to ODNR. 
Delaware County is home to O’Shaughnessy and Hoover reservoirs, two large man-made lakes that are a key part of Columbus’ water supply. 
Alum Creek Lake and Delaware Lake, two other man-made bodies of water, also are in Delaware County. Each is home to a state park. 
Jordan’s claim was that Delaware County had more waterfront property than any other in the state of Ohio. ODNR’s experts, using computer data to prepare the estimates, would agree",True,"June 27, 2013"
"As a student at Occidental College in Los Angeles from 1979 to 1981, ""there were days where folks couldn't go outside. … because of all the pollution in the air.""","
When President Barack Obama gave a major address on climate change on June 25, 2013, he reached back more than three decades for a personal anecdote to support his argument. 
""Now, what you'll hear from the special interests and their allies in Congress is that (my climate change plan) will kill jobs and crush the economy and basically end American free-enterprise as we know it,"" Obama said. ""And the reason I know you'll hear those things is because that's what they said every time America sets clear rules and better standards for our air and our water and our children's health. 
""And every time they've been wrong,"" Obama continued. ""when I was going to school in 1979, 1980 in Los Angeles, there were days where folks couldn't go outside -- and the sunsets were spectacular -- because of all the pollution in the air. 
""At the time when we passed the Clean Air Act, to try to get rid of some of this smog, some of the same doomsayers were saying, ‘New pollution standards will decimate the auto industry.’ Guess what? It didn't happen. Our air got cleaner."" 
Many Twitter users asked us whether it was really true that during Obama’s days in Los Angeles ""there were days where folks couldn't go outside. … because of all the pollution in the air."" 
We’ll start with some background on smog. The smog predominant in Los Angeles -- formally known as ""photochemical smog"" -- is created when light reacts with motor vehicle and industrial emissions to form ground-level ozone. This ozone can make it difficult to breathe, causing asthma attacks and lung inflammation, as well as making eyes itchy and watery. 
In the United States, at least, Los Angeles has been ground zero for smog for decades, due to its heavy automobile usage, its industrial base and the presence of mountains and valleys, which prevent polluted air from floating elsewhere. Los Angeles smog emerged in the 1940s and worsened from the 1950s to the 1970s. It got so bad in October 1954 that the city virtually shut down for the entire month (and gas masks were common, as the photograph below illustrates). Smog became so closely identified with Los Angeles that ""smog in a can"" became a popular gag gift. 
Today, Los Angeles still has smog -- in April 2013, the American Lung Association ranked L.A. first in the nation for ozone pollution, as well as fourth for particulate pollution such as dust and soot. But concerted environmental efforts have reduced the extent of the problem significantly. 
In rising order of seriousness, smog alerts for southern California start with health advisories and move upwards to stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3. The last stage 3 smog alert came in 1974 -- so long ago that Ronald Reagan was still governor. The last stage 2 alert came in 1988, and there has been only one stage 1 alert since 1998 (it came in 2003). 
""Peak ozone levels in southern California today are roughly one-third of what they were in the late 1970s, due to aggressive and innovative air pollution controls here,"" said Sam Atwood, a spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality Management District, the air-pollution control agency for Los Angeles, Orange County and portions of Riverside and San Bernardino counties. 
So what would Obama have experienced when he was a student at Occidental, the college he attended before transferring to Columbia University for his junior and senior year? We can approximate the impact based on statistical and anecdotal evidence. 
Occidental, located in the Eagle Rock neighborhood northeast of downtown L.A., would have been subject to many of the smog risks typical of the region from 1979 to 1981. 
According to South Coast Air Quality Management District data, a health advisory -- a comparatively low-level alert -- was issued somewhere in the agency’s region of jurisdiction 169 times in 1979, 152 times in 1980 and 159 times in 1981. The stage 1 threshold was met 120, 101, and 99 times during those three years. 
Even allowing that Occidental itself may have experienced just a fraction of these episodes, the university still would have faced a significant number. 
So what did these advisories mean in a practical sense? For a health advisory, the lowest of these levels, all children are supposed to ""discontinue prolonged, vigorous outdoor exercise lasting longer than one hour,"" and ""susceptible persons, such as those with heart or lung disease"" should ""avoid outdoor activity,"" including ""calisthenics, basketball, running, soccer, football, tennis, swimming laps, and water polo."" 
For the more severe stage 1 episodes, all children are supposed to ""discontinue all vigorous outdoor activities regardless of duration,"" including ""physical education classes, sports practices, and athletic competitions."" 
Finally, for stage 2 or stage 3, all children are supposed to ""discontinue all outdoor activities."" 
This suggests that Obama’s claim is slightly exaggerated. He said that ""there were days where folks couldn't go outside,"" but nothing in the rules addressed what healthy adults could do, including healthy college-age kids. Rather, the rules addressed adults with compromised health as well as children. 
Still, the reality of smog alerts was not pretty, and by all accounts, staying inside, if feasible, was certainly preferable. 
The White House pointed us to a Newsweek article from Sept. 24, 1979, when Obama was just settling in at Occidental, that documents what it called the worst L.A. smog in 24 years. ""Tennis courts stood empty,"" the article said. ""Golf courses lay nearly deserted. Schools canceled recess, and the usual parade of joggers around Pasadena's Rose Bowl dwindled to just a handful."" 
We found other first-hand testimony. Char Miller, a professor of environmental analysis at Pomona College in the Los Angeles suburb of Claremont, recalls enduring smog alerts when he was a student at neighboring Pitzer College in the mid 1970s. ""There were way too many days when you could not see the mountain that today frames my office window,"" he said. ""It was possible to not know it was there for months at a time."" 
And William Kelly, the co-author of Smogtown: The Lung-Burning History of Pollution in Los Angeles, recalls attending Occidental a few years before Obama. 
""When I got there in 1973, I played a vigorous game of basketball in an un-air-conditioned gym,"" Kelly said. ""I don't remember the end of the game, just waking up in the early evening with a pounding headache and watering eyes and wheezing in my dorm room. Turns out there was a stage 2 smog alert going on that afternoon, and I didn't have a clue."" 
Our ruling 
Obama said that as a student at Occidental College in Los Angeles from 1979 to 1981, ""there were days where folks couldn't go outside. … because of all the pollution in the air."" 
The idea that ""folks couldn’t go outside"" is an oversimplification. The advisories -- and they were only advisories -- were aimed at children and people who had existing health concerns. But Obama is right that smog was a severe problem at the time in the Los Angeles region",Mostly True,"June 26, 2013"
"""RIPTA has really some of the fullest buses for its transit agency size around the country.""","
Public transportation was one of the topics when Abel Collins, program manager for the Rhode Island chapter of the Sierra Club, was a guest on the June 2 edition of ""10 News Conference."" 
Collins, an unsuccessful independent candidate for Congress in the 2nd District in 2012, said one goal of his organization is to cut pollution by getting better funding for the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, which operates the state’s bus system. 
""They're stuck. They have declining revenues and increasing demand. And RIPTA has really some of the fullest buses for its transit agency size around the country,"" he said. ""So it's really something that should get more attention and hopefully this is the year that the General Assembly sees fit to give RIPTA sustainable funding for the long term. There's a bill to do that and we've been pushing on it for years."" 
We wondered whether RIPTA does, in fact, have some of the fullest buses around. 
We called Collins. He said he was told that factoid by Mark Therrien, the authority's assistant general manager for planning. 
We called Therrien. He said Collins was correct. When we asked for details, he referred us to the Integrated National Transit Database Analysis System (INTDAS) which has national statistics over many years for transit systems throughout the United States. 
The database will generate a list of comparable transit systems around the country. We did that for RIPTA and decided to focus on the 30 that were closest based on a variety of measures such as size, according to the federal ranking. We also looked at six other systems -- in Eugene, Ore.; Fort Worth, Texas; Jacksonville, Fla.; Memphis, Tenn.; Louisville, Ky.; and Des Moines, Iowa -- that Therrien said were comparable as well. 
But what to look at? 
The database, whose most recent statistics were from 2011, doesn't include a direct measurement of how full the buses are. 
We discovered there were a lot of indirect ways to estimate capacity that gave different rankings. 
Therrien said we should look at passengers per hour. By that measure, RIPTA ranked 8th out of 37 systems. 
We also looked at the number of passenger trips divided by the number of vehicles in operation during peak hours. RIPTA ranked 9th by that measure. 
Meanwhile, we received an e-mail from Albert Gan, a professor with the department of civil and environmental engineering at Florida International University, who developed the INTDAS system. 
He said the correct method would be to divide the number of passenger miles in a year by the number of miles driven when the buses were picking and dropping off passengers (known as revenue miles). By that measure, RIPTA ranked 13th out of 37. 
Then we heard back from Therrien's office, which advised us that it was best to look at the number of passenger trips divided by the number of revenue miles. In that instance, RIPTA ranked 10th. 
Some other systems were pretty crowded using that yardstick. Milwaukee had 24 percent more passengers per bus than Providence; Madison had 34 percent more; Eugene had 39 percent more; and Rochester, N.Y. had 46 percent more. 
To sum up, Abel Collins said, ""RIPTA has really some of the fullest buses for its transit agency size around the country."" 
""Some of the fullest"" is a little vague, but it implies that Rhode Island is going to be up there in the rankings. 
RIPTA, asked about the claim, suggested that we look at 11 transit systems. We ultimately analyzed data on more than three times that many, using a federal rating method that listed bus services comparable to Rhode Island's. 
RIPTA's rankings ranged from 8th to 13th. They varied a bit because there's no standardized way to calculate who has the ""fullest"" buses",Mostly True,"June 9, 2013"
"Says 
""With nearly 75 percent of Americans supportive of the construction of the pipeline, Schrader needs to explain to Oregon families why he voted against this needed project.""","The communications office of the National Republican Congressional Committee isn’t letting up on Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore. It’s recently peppered him with criticism over the sequester and President Barack Obama’s health care overhaul. This time, the issue is construction of a controversial pipeline that would carry crude oil from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast for refinement.   A May 23, 2013, press release targeted Schrader for voting against H.R. 3, a bill that would allow TransCanada to start building the Keystone XL Pipeline without approval from President Barack Obama. Specifically, the legislation skips further environmental review and removes barriers to construction.   ""With nearly 75 percent of Americans supportive of the construction of the pipeline, Schrader needs to explain to Oregon families why he voted against this needed project,"" the release states.   Three-quarters of Americans want this project to happen? We know surveys can sometimes use scurrilous, squirrelly language, so we thought we’d take a look-see.  Plus, while Schrader is a veterinarian who loves animals, the man is no tree-hugging environmentalist. Does he oppose construction?   Let’s tackle the 75 percent statistic first. The NRCC relies on a survey conducted by Nanos Research that was the subject of an April 2013 news report in the Wall Street Journal.   Here’s the survey question: Based on what you have heard about the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline between Canada and the U.S., do you support, somewhat support, somewhat oppose or oppose the US/Canadian government approving the project?   Of Americans, 52 percent said they support the project and 22 percent said they somewhat support it.   Nanos, a respected independent polling firm, isn’t the only one to find that a majority of respondents in the United States support construction. An April 2013 Pew Research poll found 66 percent in favor with 23 percent opposed. The poll found broader support among Republicans and independents; Democrats are more divided.   We checked with Daniel Kessler, a media campaigner with 350.org, which opposes Keystone. The Nanos polling question looked sound to him, although he wanted to remind readers that other surveys show high support for clean energy alternatives and efforts to combat global warming.   Now, let’s address the second part of the statement. As we stated earlier, H.R. 3 eliminates the need for White House approval to start the project.   It’s undisputed that Schrader voted against the bill. Nineteen House Democrats joined majority Republicans to send the bill to the Senate, where it sits. No House Democrat from Oregon voted for the legislation. In fact, the NRCC targeted a number of Democrats with the same press release, including Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore.   A spokesman for Schrader said the congressman supports construction in principle, just not the way Republicans are going about it. ""To say that he does not support the construction on the pipeline is false,"" wrote spokesman Cody Tucker in an email to PolitiFact Oregon.   Annie Clark with the NRCC disagrees. She cited four other times where Schrader voted against construction. ""Schrader voted against constructing or expediting construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline every chance he had,"" she wrote to PolitiFact Oregon.   We checked his other votes. The legislation sought to force Obama to act or bypassed him altogether in approving Keystone. Loads of House Democrats voted against the bills.   Schrader did vote against H.R. 3, which eliminates further regulatory hurdles, eliminates presidential input and essentially gives congressional go-ahead for construction. This statement by itself we would rate Half True.   It is partially accurate in that Schrader did vote against the legislation, which authorizes the project. But it is missing significant details in that Schrader supports construction in principle, just not this particular way to get there",True,"June 1, 2013"
"A bill to advance the Keystone XL Pipeline ""is an earmark"" under House rules.","Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., recently took an unusual approach to opposing the Keystone XL pipeline, a 1,700-mile project to bring heavy crude from Canada’s oil-rich tar sands to the Gulf of Mexico. He says it’s an earmark, and earmarks aren’t in line with current House rules. ""The Keystone XL Pipeline deal is an earmark to a foreign corporation, plain and simple,"" Grayson said in a news release. ""House Republicans claim to have been incredibly keen on ridding our legislative system of congressional earmarks — yet here they are — hypocritically sneaking one in for a foreign corporation. They seem to believe that the ‘no earmarks’ rule does not apply to them. That’s just unacceptable."" For years, environmentalists have battled pipeline supporters over the construction of the new pipeline. This year, supporters turned to the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives to essentially waive a variety of regulatory hurdles that have so far delayed the project’s groundbreaking. A bill, H.R. 3, would effectively sidestep the key governmental reviews delaying the project, which is to be built by TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, L.P., a Canadian company. H.R. 3 declares that a presidential permit is not required to advance the project. It also clears the project under the the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act, the Mineral Leasing Act, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, among other laws; and prevents the Environmental Protection Agency Administrator from blocking the project. On May 21, 2013, as H.R. 3 was moving toward a vote in the House, Grayson wrote a letter to House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, in which he argued that the bill was an earmark. We were intrigued by Grayson’s argument and wanted to look in detail at whether the Keystone project fit the definition of an earmark. What is an earmark? Generally speaking, an earmark is a requirement that money approved by Congress be spent in a specific way at the request of a lawmaker. Critics say earmarks serve the interest of a particular congressional district or constituent group rather than the national good. That's why congressional Republicans -- and President Barack Obama -- have promised to curb their use, with some degree of success. To make his case that H.R. 3 was an earmark, Grayson pointed to the section of the House’s rules that define what constitutes an earmark. House rules are written by the chamber’s majority party every two years and approved, typically on a party-line vote, when a new Congress is sworn in. House rules do not have the force of law, but they are binding for the procedures used in the chamber. The current version of the House rules says earmarks are a specific authorization of spending, targeted to a specific purpose or place, and made without a competitive award process. Here’s the exact definition: ""For the purpose of this clause, the term ‘congressional earmark’ means a provision or report language included primarily at the request of a Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, or Senator providing, authorizing or recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget authority, credit authority, or other spending authority for a contract, loan, loan guarantee, grant, loan authority, or other expenditure with or to an entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality or Congressional district, other than through a statutory or administrative formula-driven or competitive award process."" To sharpen his case to Boehner, Grayson streamlined this language by removing some of the extra words. Grayson’s shortened earmark definition was: ""a provision … included primarily at the request of a Member ... providing (or) authorizing … a .. grant ... to an entity … other than through a statutory or administrative … or competitive award process."" H.R. 3, Grayson wrote, provides a special benefit, ""outside of established statutory, administrative or competitive award processes, and it does so to only one entity -- explicitly named in this bill, ‘TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, L.P.’"" Grayson went on to argue that the ""requirement that this provision be included ‘primarily at the request of a Member’ is surely satisfied by the act of a Member drafting and offering this bill. It was the conscious choice of a Member from the state of Nebraska to offer this legislation, as well as explicitly mention Nebraska or Nebraskans six separate times, while no other state receives a single mention."" We checked with several experts on House procedure to see what they thought of Grayson’s argument. They were not convinced. They said their concerns go beyond H.R. 3’s superficial differences with classic earmarks, though it has some of those, too. Typically, earmarks are narrow provisions of larger bills inserted and supported by a small number of lawmakers and advancing a highly localized purpose, such as a local road or construction project. By contrast, H.R. 3 is a stand-alone bill, it has been co-sponsored by 134 House members and it would clear the way for a project that runs from the Canadian border to the Gulf of Mexico. But the more important problem, the experts said, is that the bill does not affect federal spending -- something the House rule explicitly requires. Grayson, they said, got around this by dropping most of the following clause from his streamlined definition: ""providing, authorizing or recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget authority, credit authority, or other spending authority."" Donald Wolfensberger, a former Republican staff director of the House Rules Committee who currently directs the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, cited the Congressional Budget Office in arguing that H.R. 3 ""comes nowhere near being an earmark as defined by House rules, period."" When CBO -- Congress’ nonpartisan fiscal-analysis arm -- weighed the bill’s fiscal impact, it found that ""implementing H.R. 3 would have no significant impact on the federal budget. Based on information from affected agencies, CBO estimates that the proposed changes to administrative procedures would not significantly affect federal spending for such activities relative to current law. The bill would not affect direct spending or revenues."" Roy T. Meyers, political scientist at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County who has studied budgeting and earmarks, said he was ""astonished to see how (Grayson) selectively and misleadingly edited the definition of earmark, then compounded the fault by drawing a bizarre inference regarding the bill's effective approval of a permit. This bill is about administrative regulation, or more accurately, the lack of it. The earmark definition restricts its application to spending, and lists different types of spending, including grants. Grayson cuts the words on spending and the other types of spending besides grants and replaces these missing words with ellipses, which completely changes the meaning."" Two other experts -- Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, and Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansas political scientist -- agreed with this analysis. ""There has to be a dollar figure associated with the provision, and this bill does not have that,"" Ellis said. Grayson’s office stands by its classification of the bill as an earmark, arguing that the House voted on a measure that amounts to a special favor to one entity, for one project, and that was requested by a Member of Congress, Rep. Lee Terry, R-Neb. Despite Meyers’ deep skepticism of Grayson’s claim that the bill is an earmark under House rules, he said Grayson has a point. ""Earmarks have been criticized, often justifiably, for not being subject to sufficient scrutiny on their policy merits,"" Myers said. ""Unlike most research grants that are subject to demanding peer reviews, or many contracts that must undergo extensive agency review and competitive bidding, earmarks are awarded only after cursory reviews, typically by committee staff. Congress substitutes its judgment on a particular case, cutting agencies and other experts out of the loop."" The similarity here, Meyers said, is that the bill prevents agencies from doing their job -- to assess the impacts of a proposed project. Still, that’s not the same thing as arguing that H.R. 3 actually qualifies as an earmark under House rules. ""Grayson would be smarter to argue that the bill violates the spirit, not the letter, of the earmark moratorium and the philosophy that supposedly backs it,"" Meyers said. We should note that the House -- the only body that can officially determine whether a bill fits the earmark definition under the chamber’s rules -- has not passed judgment on Grayson’s claim. When Grayson raised his argument on the House floor, the lawmaker chairing the proceedings ruled that Grayson’s request was improper, dismissing it before allowing any discussion of the substance of Grayson’s complaint. Grayson’s office added that they have not received ruling determination on the merits of his arguments from the House parliamentarian’s office. This result is not surprising. Grayson wasn’t going into court to argue to an impartial judge; in the House, whichever party happens to be in the majority controls the chamber to a near-dictatorial degree. And to nobody’s surprise, the measure passed by a 241-175 margin when it came to a vote on May 22, 2013. No Republican broke ranks by opposing it, while 19 Democrats sided with the majority in supporting the bill. Because the Democratic-controlled Senate is unlikely to agree, the bill is not expected to become law. Our ruling Grayson said a bill to advance the Keystone XL Pipeline ""is an earmark"" under House rules. Officially, the House -- the only entity that can make this ruling -- has not rendered a judgment on Grayson’s claim. But several experts on earmarks that we checked with were unanimous that Grayson was wrong by the clear language of the rule. The House’s definition of ""earmark"" is based on the notion that the provision in question spends federal money, which the bill in question does not -- a difference that Grayson carefully edited out when he made his argument to Boehner",False,"May 31, 2013"
"""18 percent of our land in our state right now is either federally, state or county owned for conservation purposes.""","If state Sen. Alberta Darling is correct, nearly one of every five acres of land in Wisconsin is owned by the federal, state or county government and is set aside for conservation. That’s open space for forests and parks, as well as for activities such as fishing, hiking, camping and snowmobiling. Darling, a suburban Milwaukee Republican, uttered the statistic in the context of: When is enough, enough? With the Legislature considering a reduction in what the state spends on such land acquisitions, it’s time for a conservation conversation. Joint Finance and stewardship Darling is co-chairwoman of the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee, a 16-member panel of Senate and Assembly members that reviews all state appropriations and revenue -- most notably the state budget. Inevitably, the committee makes changes in the governor’s biennial budget proposal before the Legislature adopts the budget and the governor signs it into law. On May 15, 2013, in the thick of reviewing Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s 2014-2015 budget, the GOP-controlled committee discussed whether to spend less on the state stewardship program, which is one way government buys land for conservation. The money comes from borrowing and is repaid with tax dollars. At one point during the discussion, Darling stated: ""We've had a lot of people around the state tell us, you know, the stewardship program's a great program. We have a lot of very precious lands. But we have 18 percent of our land in our state right now is either federally, state or county owned for conservation purposes. A lot of our constituents are saying, What is the endgame here?"" So, let’s see where the 18 percent claim comes from. (By the way, Walker’s budget proposal kept stewardship spending the same -- $120 million over two years. After its discussion, Joint Finance voted to reduce that amount by $18 million. The state budget is supposed to be finalized by July 1, 2013.) Darling’s evidence Darling spokesman Bob Delaporte cited two sources to back Darling’s statement. 1. A January 2013 report from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. It estimated that 5.89 million acres, or 16.95 percent, of Wisconsin’s 34.8 million acres were owned for conservation as of June 30, 2012. That includes the 1.5 million-acre Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest in the North Woods; state forests, such as the 232,000-acre Northern Highland American Legion State Forest in Iron, Oneida, and Vilas counties; as well as county parks and forests. 2. A March 2013 email from the Department of Natural Resources to the Joint Finance Committee co-chairs, which quotes a higher figure: 18.5 percent. That email noted Wisconsin’s rate is higher than Illinois’ and Iowa’s, which are both below 3 percent; but lower than Michigan’s 22 percent and Minnesota’s 25 percent. Darling’s spokesman told us the senator ""went with 18 percent"" during the finance committee discussion because that figure is between the fiscal bureau’s estimate, rounded up, of 17 percent and the DNR’s estimate of 18.5 percent. Indeed, either figure, if accurate, would essentially back Darling’s claim, given that they are estimates. We talked with the authors of the fiscal bureau report and the DNR’s email, as well as other officials. One reason the DNR figure is higher is that it included federally owned properties such as military installations. Another reason the DNR’s figure varies from the fiscal bureau’s figure is the estimates were done at different times. So, we came up with the following breakdown to provide the best figures available. The county and federal acreage numbers are from the fiscal bureau, which the DNR agreed is the most up to date. And the DNR provided us its current figures for state-owned conservation land.

Says he has sued the Obama administration 25 times.,"
Here’s a typical workday for Texas’ attorney general: ""I go into the office, I sue the federal government and I go home,"" Greg Abbott was quoted as saying to a tea party group in an April 30, 2013, Associated Press news story. 
Speaking to FreedomWorks Texas in Austin on April 27, Abbott said, ""I’ve sued the Obama administration now 25 times, over the last four years."" 
Last fall, the Associated Press tallied two dozen: Abbott ""has filed 24 lawsuits against the federal government since Obama took office — litigation that has cost the state $2.58 million and more than 14,113 hours spent by staff and state lawyers working those cases,"" said a Sept. 9, 2012, news story. 
Abbott spokeswoman Lauren Bean emailed us an updated list of Texas’ lawsuits against the federal government: three during President George W. Bush’s tenure and 27 since President Barack Obama’s Jan. 20, 2009, inauguration. (Abbott himself was sworn in Dec. 2, 2002.) 
Outcomes of the 27 Obama-era lawsuits, by our count: five clear-cut ""wins,"" eight ""losses,"" four cases in which Texas agreed to dismiss its case when circumstances changed, nine cases in progress -- and one that could be called a partial win, perhaps: 2010’s 26-state challenge to Obamacare that ended with the Supreme Court declaring it was legal to tax individuals without health care, but states could not be required to expand Medicaid. 
Abbott’s staff, Bean said, would count eight ""wins"" during the Obama administration, including the Medicaid decision and two dismissals in which ""the state got what it wanted."" Bean noted all but one ""win"" are final (can no longer be appealed) and of the eight ""losses,"" she said, six are being appealed and one could be appealed. 
In our count of five ""wins,"" four lawsuits were against the Environmental Protection Agency and one against the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The EPA has appealed one ruling to the Supreme Court, and FERC filed for a clarification of the judgment in its case. 
In most of the 27 cases, Texas was the lead plaintiff or only plaintiff. These included lawsuits in which Abbott was acting at the request of a department or branch of Texas state government. Bean said, ""We file them on behalf of state agencies. We’re the lawyer, they’re the client."" 
Twice, Texas was originally listed among other states but not as the lead plaintiff, and in 11 cases Texas and other states or parties filed similar lawsuits that were bundled together by the courts sometimes resulting in Texas not being listed as the lead, or original, plaintiff. 
Both cases in which Texas was an original plaintiff but not the lead plaintiff involved challenges to Obamacare: the 2010 lawsuit by 26 states that ended with the Supreme Court declaring it was legal to tax individuals without health care and the 2012 case in which seven states sued over a requirement that religious employers offer insurance covering certain birth control methods. 
For perspective, we reached Stefanie Lindquist, associate dean for external affairs at the University of Texas Law School with a specialty in empirical legal studies. Lindquist told us by phone that she would not attach much significance to those circumstances when trying to determine whether Texas was itself suing the federal government agency. 
""This is situations where they’re actually named parties in the suit,"" she said, rather than, for example, filing a brief lending support to one side. 
States’ attorneys general often join forces to challenge laws, she said, as in the Obamacare lawsuit that eventually included 26 states. (Texas was among 14 states listed as plaintiffs in the original suit, filed by Florida.) 
""They’re lending resources, so it’s not that Texas is not a real litigant,"" Lindquist said. Even when later joining other plaintiffs, she said, ""I don’t think that means they’re not a plaintiff, I just think it means they’re one of many."" 
Democratic activist Matt Angle, whom we asked to weigh in, did object to Abbott’s inclusion of the two multi-state Obamacare lawsuits. But he raised a larger objection: the inclusion of two cases in which Texas sought preclearance under the federal Voting Rights Act for changes to its voting process. 
Angle, founder of the Washington, D.C.-based Lone Star Project, told us by email that in filing these suits, Abbott ""took action as a defensive and not offensive tactic. ... No way he should get credit in these two instances."" 
Under the Voting Rights Act, governments in certain jurisdictions (notably, several Southern states) where minority voter turnout was previously low must get federal clearance before changes in voting laws can take effect. 
To get that clearance, Lindquist said, ""you have a choice of two different avenues. One is you can request the preclearance of the election law change with the Department of Justice via letter. … Or, you can go to court to seek the preclearance"" by the action of filing a lawsuit. 
During the Obama administration, Texas has sought preclearance twice in high-profile cases -- in 2011, for redrawn legislative voting districts, and in 2012, for a measure requiring voters to show photo identification at the polls. 
In those cases, Lindquist said, ""to say yes, that the State of Texas sued the government, yes that’s true.""  But looking at the main purpose of such suits, she said, ""it’s not quite the same as suing the government to force the government to change its behavior. They’re suing the federal government to seek preclearance under a federal law, and they’re just going to a different forum to do it."" 
Our ruling 
Abbott said, ""I’ve sued the Obama administration now 25 times."" Since Obama became president, Texas has filed or been a party to 27 lawsuits against the federal government",True,"May 10, 2013"
"""Science has not shown greenhouse gases to be a problem.""","Wayne Smith does not sweat greenhouse gases.

""Science has not shown greenhouse gases to be a problem,"" the Republican Baytown state representative told the Austin American-Statesman for a news article posted online April 17, 2013.

Smith, who seeks legislative approval of a proposal to have the state issue permits for such industrial emissions, also said that nevertheless, ""there’s no need to regulate greenhouse gases."" House members sent his proposal to the Senate that week.

We explored whether science has not shown greenhouse gases--meaning various gaseous compounds (such as carbon dioxide) that absorb infrared radiation, trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to the greenhouse effect--to be a problem.

Smith, who represents a district that is home to petrochemical plants, did not respond to telephone inquiries, but we ran his claim by Paul C. ""Chip"" Knappenberger, assistant director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, which might be philosophically compatible with the Texan.

By phone, Knappenberger said the effects of greenhouse gases on climate change are scientifically proven.

But whether that’s a problem, he said, is ""open-ended. If you define all change as a problem, then you have a problem. How much of a problem it is depends on how fast and how large the climate change is that results.""

Knappenberger also pointed out articles he wrote in February and March 2013 suggesting fresh research indicates the generally predicted pace of warming may be overstated. ""I am not convinced that the pace of global warming is sufficient enough to make greenhouse gas emissions a ‘problem,’"" Knappenberger emailed.

Separately, several experts including the Texas state climatologist, John Nielsen-Gammon, told us the scientific consensus is that increases in greenhouse gases, mostly due to burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil, have been contributing to global warming, though the pace of that warming is uncertain.

Naomi Oreskes, a professor of history at the University of California, San Diego, sent us a chapter of a pending book updating her 2004 look into scientific consensus about climate change. A portion of the chapter says: ""Scientists predicted a long time ago that increasing greenhouse gas emissions could change the climate, and now there is overwhelming evidence that it is changing the climate."" However, ""to say that man-made global warming is underway is not the same as agreeing about what will happen in the future. Much of the continuing debate in the scientific community involves the likely rate of future change. ""

""There are climate scientists who actively do research in the field but disagree with the consensus position,"" the chapter later says, ""but their number is very, very small.""

By phone, Nielsen-Gammon said a helpful indicator of the scientific consensus is the latest assessment of global warming factors, published in 2007 by the International Panel on Climate Change. That body was created in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environmental Programme to evaluate the state of climate science as a basis for informed policy action, primarily on the basis of peer-reviewed and published scientific literature, Oreskes has noted.

The 2007 report says both that evidence of global warming is ""unequivocal"" and that most ""of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations.""

In the United States by itself, Nielsen-Gammon pointed out, the National Research Council, which is among a few independent, nonprofit U.S. institutions that provide science, technology, and health policy advice under a congressional charter, issued an analysis in May 2011. A press release summarizing that work opens: ""Warning that the risk of dangerous climate change impacts is growing with every ton of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere, a"" council ""committee today reiterated the pressing need for substantial action to limit the magnitude of climate change and to prepare to adapt to its impacts.""

Separately, an online search led us to a survey of scientists, published in 2009, that initially asked more than 10,000 earth scientists to participate. Among 3,146 respondents asked if they think ""human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures,"" 82 percent answered affirmatively, with 97 pecent of those respondents with the most climate expertise saying yes.

The article, whose lead author was Peter T. Doran, a professor of earth and environmental sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago, closes: ""It seems that the debate on the authenticity of global warming and the role played by human activity is largely nonexistent among those who understand the nuances and scientific basis of long-term climate processes. The challenge, rather, appears to be how to effectively communicate this fact to policy makers and to a public that continues to mistakenly perceive debate among scientists.""

Similarly, Oreskes said by email, the National Academy of Sciences published the results of a survey of about 900 ""actively publishing"" climate scientists in 2010, finding that 97 percent of the scientists agreed with the ""tenets of anthropogenic climate change,"" meaning human contributions to warming.

Oreskes told us by email: ""The conclusion that humans have contributed to global warming cannot be separated from the role of greenhouse gases  produced by burning fossil fuels. To separate human activities from greenhouse gases is a false dichotomy. Increased greenhouse gases are a direct result of human activities, mainly burning fossil fuels. The scientific conclusion is that ‘most’ of the observed warming of the past 50 years is very likely to be due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, caused by burning fossil fuels. Most of the rest has been caused by deforestation.  Both are human activities, and both are a problem, because they drive adverse impacts like heat waves and droughts.""   

A speculation: Perhaps Smith concedes that greenhouse gases contribute to global warming, but maintains that warming itself is not a problem.

Besides, should his claim be laid aside because any definition of ""problem"" invokes personal judgment?

Scientists see that point, but...

Oreskes said by email: ""Of course, the word ‘problem’ is subjective, but insofar as one can say that there is evidence that bears on the issue, the scientific community has amply supplied that evidence."" By telephone and email, Katharine Hayhoe, director of the Climate Science Center at  Texas Tech University, said she considers greenhouse gases a very expensive problem because western civilization has been built on the premise of a stable climate. Burning fossil fuels, she said, has fed the greenhouse effect.

Our ruling

Smith said science has not shown greenhouse gases to be a problem.

But scientists have agreed for years that such gases contribute to atmospheric changes driving climatic warming, which is characterized as a global threat.

We considered the idea that the legislator’s reference to greenhouse gases as a ""problem"" reflects an uncheckable judgment, a matter of opinion. However, our sense is that his statement purported to reflect scientific consensus--and by that yardstick, it is both incorrect and ridiculous",False Pants on Fire,"May 2, 2013"
"A recent study of a proposed cap-and-trade policy’s effect on Wisconsin consumers showed it could ""raise gasoline prices by 141 percent and electricity rates by 171 percent"" by 2030.","
Ron Johnson described believers in man-made causes of climate change as ""crazy"" when he ran for U.S. Senate in 2010, saying that sunspot activity or ""just something in the geologic eons of time"" were more likely explanations for extreme weather. 
Now in his third year in the Senate,  Johnson is markedly more diplomatic when responding to constituents who want him to support limits on greenhouse gas emissions. 
""Thank you for taking the time to contact me regarding cap-and-trade policies and climate change,"" he wrote to Greg Everett, a retired musician from Conover on March 26, 2013.  ""I share your desire to protect our natural environment."" 
Still, Johnson sought to make clear to Everett -- who had signed a petition asking Johnson to support cap and trade -- his continued opposition to government intervention in this realm. 
""But I am equally concerned that misguided efforts to improve the environment can destroy much-needed jobs and new job creation,"" Johnson said in a response that Everett posted on his blog. ""Too often, these policies become so prohibitively expensive that they undermine economic growth and the average American's ability to support himself or herself."" 
Johnson then referred to ""a recent study of a proposed cap-and-trade policy."" 
The study, he wrote, ""showed it would cost Wisconsin nearly 75,000 jobs by 2030 and result in a loss of disposable income of up to $6,900 per household. It could also raise gasoline prices by 141 percent and electricity rates by 171 percent."" 
We’re aware there’s general agreement that cap-and-trade legislation carries a cost for most -- if not all -- consumers. 
But the numbers Johnson cites on gas and electric costs are eye-popping. 
Let’s take a look. 
How cap and trade works 
Generally speaking, cap and trade works like this: To slow climate change, the government would set a cap on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. To comply, companies such as electric utilities must either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits — also known as allowances — to continue polluting. 
Companies that find ways to reduce pollution easily and cheaply can end up with extra credits, and sell them to other companies that have trouble reducing their emissions or want to make longer-term investments in conservation, according to a summary by the Environmental Defense Fund. While companies may exchange allowances, the overall limit on pollution remains in place. 
The cap would then be reduced over time to ratchet down greenhouse gas emissions. A lower cap aims to make it more costly for utilities and industries to continue burning fossil fuels. 
When we asked Johnson for backup, a spokesman in his office said the constituent response refers to a 2008 study commissioned by groups concerned about a cap-and-trade bill introduced in the Senate. 
The study does have numbers very close to what Johnson cited -- 141 and 177 percent increases, for gas and oil, solely because of the bill. The study broke out price effects for each state, as well as a national figure. 
But several things jumped out at us about the study. 
In predicting price effects over nearly 25 years, the study presents a range of low and high price-hike estimates, not single figures. The low-cost estimate for gasoline is 72 percent, half of the worst-case estimate. For electricity, the low end increase was 126 percent. 
Johnson mentions only the worst-case scenario, though he did frame it as prices ""could"" jump by the higher figures. 
The study was commissioned by two groups that have opposed legislative efforts on climate change on the same economic grounds that Johnson cites. They are the American Council for Capital Formation (ACCF) and National Association of Manufacturers (NAM). 
It is relatively recent, 2008, but it focused on a bill -- the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act (S. 2191) -- first introduced in 2007. It was replaced by a companion bill in 2008, which died in the Senate. Neither got as much traction as a 2009 bill that passed the House. 
When we broadened our search, we found numerous impact studies by public and private entities on cap-and-trade legislation, and specifically on Lieberman-Warner. 
According to experts, all such efforts at forecasting energy price increases are iffy due to the complexity level. 
The cost projections on Lieberman-Warner are ""at best speculative"" and should be viewed skeptically, warned an exhaustive Congressional Research Service review of six studies. ""It is difficult to project costs up to the year 2030, much less beyond. The already tenuous assumption that regulatory standards will remain constant becomes more unrealistic, and other unforeseen events loom as critical issues which cannot be modeled."" 
Fuel price estimates, in particular, vary widely depending on various assumptions made by researchers, the review said. 
And the study for the manufacturing group -- cited by Johnson -- showed dramatically higher increases in gasoline prices than predicted in studies by two government agencies and a non-profit that supports cap and trade, the research service found. 
Gasoline: The Johnson-cited study projected hikes of $1.70 to $3.25 per gallon by 2030, while the federal government’s official source of energy statistics, the Energy Information Administration (EIA), predicted increases of 40 cents per gallon. The non-profit Clean Air Task Force put the hike at 25 cents. The figures compared are national, not specific to Wisconsin. 
Electricity: The Johnson-cited study predicted increases at least twice as high as studies by EIA, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Clean Air Task Force, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the National Mining Association. Again, the figures are national. 
The CRS specifically warned about breaking down cost impacts state by state -- as the manufacturers study did -- saying: ""Simple attempts by some presentations to break down the cost by industrial sector or by state should be viewed with attentive skepticism."" 
Overall, the service found, ""the more comprehensive analyses are the work by EPA, EIA, and MIT."" 
Another bill, another study 
The two groups behind the study Johnson relied on also did a separate projection of the Wisconsin energy cost impact of a more recent bill -- the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 sponsored by U.S. Reps. Henry Waxman and Edward Markey. 
The Waxman-Markey bill, unlike Lieberman-Warner,  passed the House 219-212 on June 26, 2009. It did not get a Senate vote. Its impact was studied in 2009. 
In that study, the two groups projected much smaller price increases from Waxman-Markey (19.9 percent to 26.1 percent for gas, and 37.5 percent to 59.7 percent for electric)than from the bill Johnson chose to highlight (increases well over 100 percent). 
That’s likely because Waxman-Markey rolled some of the revenue from pollution permits back to consumers in the form of rebates or expanded efficiency programs. 
Johnson spokesman Brian Faughnan told us Johnson’s climate change letter was simply an attempt to show the reasonable possible impact of major legislation that started in the Senate, the chamber where he serves. 
""Senator Johnson’s letter does not claim to give a full range of the estimates of the impact of cap and trade,"" Faughnan wrote in an email to us. 
And in any event, the two studies by the manufacturers show major increases in gas prices, and significantly greater electricity costs, Faughnan wrote. 
Our rating 
Experts agree that cap and trade likely means higher energy costs for consumers. 
Johnson goes further, saying it would be ""prohibitively expensive."" He tells constituents he opposes it in part because a ""recent study"" showed it could ""raise gasoline prices by 141 percent and electricity rates by 171 percent."" 
There is a study that includes those estimates for Wisconsin. 
But Johnson ignores critical facts. The same study cites much smaller increases under a second scenario. And its conclusions, published by opponents of the bill, are an outlier among several other studies that independent congressional researchers say were more thorough -- and show much smaller increases. He also ignores studies that said a more recent bill dramatically held down the size of cost increases to consumers. 
In an area in which precise conclusions are difficult, Johnson cherry-picks one study of a dead bill and presents its worst-case scenario as hard evidence of ""prohibitively expensive"" effects of a cap and trade approach",Mostly False,"April 28, 2013"
"""Narragansett Bay waters are getting warmer -- 4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer in the winter since the 1960s.""","Want evidence of man-made climate change? U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse says you can feel it in the waters of Narragansett Bay, which covers about 120.5 square miles, from Newport to Providence, in his home state of Rhode Island. ""Narragansett Bay waters are getting warmer -- 4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer in the winter since the 1960s,"" he said April 9 during one of his regular climate speeches on the floor of the Senate. He blamed the warmer temperatures for a drop in the flounder catch from more than 2,500 metric tons in the 1980s to about 150 metric tons in 2009. The reason: Warmer temperatures attract winter flounder predators earlier in the season. We can save the winter flounder factoid for another day. We were interested in whether Bay water has, in fact, gotten 4 degrees warmer since the 1960s, especially when water temperatures can fluctuate naturally from year to year. Whitehouse's office directed us to a 2008 article written by researchers at the University of Rhode Island’s Graduate School of Oceanography and published in the journal Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science. It says that the surface water of the Bay from December through February ""has warmed on average by about 2.2 degrees Celsius since 1960."" That would be 4 degrees Fahrenheit. An accompanying chart showing the trend ends at 2006. We wondered whether the increase continued beyond that. Next we contacted Jeremy Collie, a URI oceanographer. ""There's clearly a warming signal,"" he said as he looked at the trend line for data from 1959 through 2010. ""If you look at the winter months and take a regression, you get a warming rate of about 0.5 degrees F. per decade."" That would be about 2.5 degrees F. since 1960. ""So 4 degrees is a little on the high end,"" he  said. He cautioned that there can be a lot of normal variation in the readings from winter to winter. The data, collected off Fox Island, located between North Kingstown and the Jamestown Bridge, can be downloaded from URI's website (search for ""fox island 1959-2010""). We double-checked the trend, using Microsoft Excel's ability to create a chart, and found an increase, of 2.4 degrees for December-February from 1959-2010. (It rose to 2.7 degrees if you didn't include the winter of 1959-60, which might not be considered to be in the 1960s.) We also checked the data for another temperature measuring site: Whale Rock, south of the bridge on the same side of the Bay. Using data from December 1960 through February 2010, we again found an increase of 2.7 degrees F. In both locations, temperatures deeper in the water rose a bit more -- about 3 degrees -- but still not by the amount the senator said. It's unclear why the older study reported a surface temperature 1.5 degrees higher than our newer look at the data. The 2008 article appears to be using the same data we did. The additional winters we looked at had some colder-than-normal temperatures but that doesn't seem to be enough to account for the difference. Our ruling When Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said ""Narragansett Bay waters are getting warmer -- 4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer in the winter since the 1960s,"" he was citing a URI study that offered the observation after authors examined temperatures through 2006. The latest data for December, January and February -- the months used in the URI study -- extending through 2010 reveal that the increase since the '60s is less extreme.

"""A report by the US General Accountability Office (GAO) in 2008 found that the disposal of Katrina wastes by AshBritt in the south resulted in the creation of contaminated sites along the Gulf Coast and two new Superfund sites in New Orleans.""","
The company handling disposal of Hurricane Sandy debris here has a rather dirty history from the work it did along the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina, according to the director of the Sierra Club New Jersey chapter. 
  
The company, AshBritt, left new contaminated sites in its wake as it did cleanup along the Gulf Coast after 2005’s Hurricane Katrina, Jeff Tittel said in a Feb. 22 opinion column he wrote for NJToday.net. 
  
""A report by the US General (Government) Accountability Office (GAO) in 2008 found that the disposal of Katrina wastes by AshBritt in the south resulted in the creation of contaminated sites along the Gulf Coast and two new Superfund sites in New Orleans,"" Tittel wrote in his column, which explored links between Hurricane Sandy and climate change. 
  
This claim caught our eye since AshBritt received a no-bid contract from New Jersey to handle the bulk of the Hurricane Sandy cleanup. Even more eye-catching? The nearly 40-page GAO report cited by Tittel not only never mentions AshBritt, it looks only at debris disposal in the New Orleans area. 
  
Let’s first review some background about how Florida-based AshBritt came to New Jersey. 
  
Hurricane Sandy slammed New Jersey on Oct. 29, 2012, causing widespread damage here, in New York and Connecticut. Hours after the storm, Gov. Chris Christie awarded AshBritt a no-bid contract that piggybacked off one the company had with Connecticut. The decision has drawn public scrutiny for a variety of reasons, such as higher-than-usual disposal costs to towns for which AshBritt has handled debris disposal. 
  
Now let’s get into Tittel’s claim about that GAO report. 
  
AshBritt general counsel Jared Moskowitz called Tittel’s claim about the company’s role in New Orleans and Louisiana ""hocus pocus."" 
  
Moskowitz said AshBritt was only in Louisiana for a couple of weeks after Katrina before the Army Corps of Engineers moved them to do debris removal work in Mississippi. 
  
""We weren’t in New Orleans and Louisiana long enough to create a Superfund site,"" Moskowitz told us. ""It is a lie."" 
  
The Army Corps of Engineers confirmed that AshBritt worked briefly in New Orleans before moving east to Mississippi. 
  
We also checked with the GAO about AshBritt’s alleged role, and the agency confirmed that neither AshBritt nor any other disposal company was referenced in their report. The GAO is the investigative arm of Congress. 
  
""We did not look at contractors at all, in fact,"" said Alfredo Gomez, a GAO spokesman. ""We looked at federal agencies and Louisiana agencies. Contractors are outside the scope of our work."" 
  
The report notes disposal violations at several New Orleans-area landfills, but doesn’t reference the ""Gulf Coast,"" as Tittel does, and details how the state dealt with those violations. 
  
Tittel said the purpose of his column was to point out debris disposal problems that occurred after Katrina and to ensure that New Jersey has strong oversight of Hurricane Sandy debris removal and the contractors doing the work. 
  
""The lesson that we saw in the Gulf was when you privatize things and you don’t have clear oversight and enforcement in place, you end up having a lot of mistakes,"" he said. 
  
Finally, let’s look at the rest of Tittel’s claim. 
  
We reviewed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s National Priorities List of Superfund sites in three Gulf Coast states hit hard by Katrina: Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. None of 31 sites listed referenced Katrina, including two in New Orleans: the Old Gentilly Landfill and the Agriculture Street Landfill. 
  
""The Agriculture Street site did not receive any debris from Katrina,"" said EPA Region 6 spokeswoman Jennah Durant. ""No new National Priority List (NPL) sites were created in New Orleans as a result of post-Katrina clean-up."" 
  
Our ruling 
  
Tittel said in an opinion column, ""A report by the US General Accountability Office (GAO) in 2008 found that the disposal of Katrina wastes by AshBritt in the south resulted in the creation of contaminated sites along the Gulf Coast and two new Superfund sites in New Orleans."" 
  
There are several major problems with Tittel’s claim. First, neither AshBritt nor any other contractor is named in the report. Second, the GAO confirmed that contractors were not part of their study. Third, the Army Corps of Engineers confirmed that AshBritt was not the major contractor in New Orleans - the company was moved to Mississippi shortly after Katrina cleanup started. Fourth, the report’s scope is limited to existing landfills in the New Orleans area – not new contamination sites or ""the Gulf Coast."" Fifth, the EPA has confirmed that post-Katrina debris did not cause new Superfund sites in New Orleans. At least five falsehoods in one claim? That’s beyond ridiculous",False Pants on Fire,"April 7, 2013"
"""Even Roger Williams National Memorial in my home state of Rhode Island attracted nearly 51,000 visitors in 2011, with non local visitors adding more than $3.2 million to the local economy.""","
As the political debate over the automatic budget cuts in the federal budget imposed under the so-called ""sequester"" has unfolded, there’s been a lot of discussion on the potential havoc they will wreak on the military and social service spending. But other less visible agencies are being hit as well. 
 Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Jack Reed took to the floor of the U.S. Senate on Feb. 27 to make just that point, lamenting cuts to the National Park Service, and how those reductions could hurt local economies. 
Reed said even in a small state like Rhode Island, they would have an effect. 
""Even Roger Williams National Memorial in my home state of Rhode Island attracted nearly 51,000 visitors in 2011, with non-local visitors adding more than $3.2 million to the local economy,"" he said. 
Good things are supposed to come in small  packages, but does the 4.5 -acre Roger Williams National Memorial really pump $3.2 million a year (about $8,767 a day) into the economy? 
While you can buy any number of books on Williams and his era in the park’s gift shop, there’s no admission charge and even the dog poop bags are free. We decided to visit the memorial, and the issue. 
Reed’s office said it got the information from the National Park Service, which tracks how many people visit its parks and other sites and how those visits contribute to local economies. When we checked with the Parks Service, we confirmed that Reed had quoted the figures accurately.   
The service put the number of recreational visits to the Roger Williams Memorial at 50,909 for 2011, the year Reed cited. It also pegged recreational spending by those people at $3.1 million, though that was based on 2010 figures. 
But are those figures realistic? 
At other parks, such as Grand Canyon or Yosemite, counting visitors is as easy as tallying how many people drove through the main gate or how many admissions were sold. 
But at an urban location such as the Roger Williams Memorial, there is no main gate, no admission paid; you just walk across the park or into the visitors center. 
National Park Service Program Manager Butch Street said that to come up with attendance figures for such sites,  the agency takes the number of people who enter the visitors center -- tracked by staff there -- and multiplies it by 3.3.   
In 2011, the year Reed noted, 15,427 people entered  the Roger Williams Memorial visitors center. Multiply that by  3.3 and you get 50,909. That method has produced annual visitor totals of more than 50,000 since 2009. 
(We did our own, extremely unscientific sample late in the morning of March 14, when it was in the low 30s and windy. One person went into the visitor center while 23 people and 1 dog walked through the park.) 
Once the park service gets the total visitor number, it plugs it into what it calls a Money Generation Multiplier. That’s a formula specifically designed to estimate how much each visitor spent. 
The formula assigns values for average spending on lodging and other purchases. The latest economic impact figures the park service has are from 2010, when the attendance formula said 51,559 visitors came to Roger Williams. 
The park service’s formula assumed those visitors generated 7,017 motel stays at about $277 per day, for around $1.94 million in spending. It also assumed 10,907 day trips to the park, at around $77 per party, for about $840,000 of spending and 2,215 camping visits at $145 a day, for about $322,000. Combined, that’s about $3.1 million into the Providence region’s economy. 
The parks service cautions that the numbers for urban sites should be seen as having a wide margin for error. 
""Due to the high number of visits at these units, small changes in assumed spending averages or segment mixes can swing the spending estimates by substantial amounts,"" it said. 
Edinaldo Tebaldi, a Bryant University assistant professor of economics who specializes in the use of statistics to track economic activity, said they got that part right. 
Tebaldi said the park service’s basic methodology was sound, in that the multipliers it used to estimate spending were generally reasonable and applied in a way consistent with professional standards. But he said his question was with the starting assumptions. 
""The report relies on several strong assumptions that are debatable,"" he said. ""However, they make it clear that that is what they are doing, so they are transparent about it."" 
The problem, Tebaldi said, is that the park service’s overall visits figure is counting people walking through the park on their way to somewhere else as visitors. 
""This is unreasonable and deserves further consideration,"" Tebaldi said.  ""The scope and size of the park makes it unreasonable to assume that it is the single driver of that many visitors to Rhode Island."" 
Our ruling 
Sen. Jack Reed said Roger Williams National Memorial attracted nearly 51,000 visitors in 2011, ""with non-local visitors adding more than $3.2 million to the local economy."" 
Reed accurately quoted figures from the park service. 
We believe you can make a case for the number of visitors, considering how many local people walk their dogs in the park or just sit on benches in the shade for a quiet lunchtime read in the summer. 
But are families from out of state packing up the minivan, driving to Rhode Island and booking motel rooms -- or campsites -- just to see the park? Not likely",Half True,"March 27, 2013"
"""The hole in the earth that’s going to be dug (for the proposed Gogebic mine) is bigger than my entire district.""","The size of the proposed Gogebic iron ore mine in northern Wisconsin dominated debate as a bill to relax state mining laws made it through the Legislature and to Gov. Scott Walker’s desk. Supporters said the new law would maintain the state’s environmental standards while making it easier for the company to open a mine and create thousands of jobs. Opponents argued lawmakers were moving too quickly for a project of its size. During the March 7, 2013 Assembly debate, state Rep. Evan Goyke (D-Milwaukee) noted the vastness of the proposed mine and tried to put it into context. ""The hole in the earth that’s going to be dug is bigger than my entire district,"" Goyke declared. That raised some eyebrows in Madison … and sent us to the plat books and the calculator. How big is this proposed mine? And how big is Goyke’s district? The project is proposed by Gogebic Taconite, a division of Florida-based Cline Resource and Development. The company first proposed the iron ore mine in Ashland and Iron counties in 2011. A bill sought by the company to modify state laws to make mine development easier died in 2012. A similar measure was approved in 2013 and signed by Gov. Scott Walker on March 11, 2013. The new law ""relaxes environmental protections for iron mining -- but not other forms of mining -- and provides more clarity to the state process of reviewing an iron ore mine application,"" according to the Journal Sentinel’s report on the bill signing. We dug into a similar claim once before. In January 2012, we rated Mostly Falsea claim by state Rep. Penny Bernard Schaber (D-Appleton), who said ""the central size""  of the mine ""could be about two-thirds the size of Lake Winnebago."" Size of the mine When it comes to the size, Gogebic and the state Department of Natural Resources officials have offered slightly different sizes. Gogebic president Bill Williams was quoted byPolitiFact Wisconsinin 2012 as saying that the mine would be about four miles long and a half mile wide. Williams gave a rough estimate and said the mine would need up to 5,000 acres.Williams didn’t respond to a request for a more precise estimate. A state DNR mine expert, Ann Coakley, said the mine might be 1.5 miles wide. At 4 miles long and at that width, the mine would be 6 square miles or 3,840 acres, according to a conversion calculator.  And that’s before you add in access roads, rail lines, processing facilities and other facilities. Size of the district So what about the 18th Assembly District, which Goyke represents? The district lies within the city of Milwaukee, and it contains roughly the same number of people as any other Assembly district -- 57,480. But it’s far smaller, geographically, than most because it’s an urban district. The 18th stretches from Capitol Drive to the north and roughly Interstate 94 to the south. The northern part is 14 blocks wide, between N. 49th and N. 35th streets, and it lies between 60th and 15th streets at the southern base. According to the nonpartisan Legislative Technology Services Bureau, the 18th District is 3,609 acres. Another way of visualizing the mine: It’s about 4.5 miles from Miller Park to the Milwaukee Art Museum. And the Menomonee Valley corridor is roughly a mile to 1.5 miles wide. The mine wouldn’t be a rectangular swath -- plans call for it to wrap down and around a ridge in an area known as the Penokee Range, but you get the idea. Let’s put the mine into the context of the North Woods. The vast 74th Assembly District that includes the mine site is 3.3 million acres. So, the mine represents about a tenth of 1 percent of it. Another yardstick: Iron County alone is 802 square miles, or 513,280 acres. Let’s power down our calculators. Goyke says the proposed Gogebic mine would be larger than his district. Using the smallest size estimates, the mine would cover 3,840 acres, or 231 acres more than the 18th Assembly district. Goyke got his numbers right. But he’s also got an advantage -- geographically, his densely populated district is the second smallest in the state, trailing only the 8th on Milwaukee’s south side",True,"March 22, 2013"
Says bag litter increased after San Francisco banned single-use shopping bags.,"
Austin’s ban on disposable shopping bags is ""all for show,"" according to freshman state Rep. Drew Springer. 
""In San Francisco, litter from bags actually increased after enacting their ban,"" he said in a press release issued March 5, the day he introduced his ""Shopping Bag Freedom Act."" 
Springer, a Republican from the North Texas town of Muenster, said he filed House Bill 2416 to stop Texas cities from ruling that businesses can’t give customers single-use plastic or paper bags. Brownsville, South Padre Island and Fort Stockton also have bag bans, and a Dallas City Council member wants ""to follow in Austin’s footsteps."" 
After Austin’s ban went into effect March 1, 2013, retailers could no longer offer thin, so-called single-use plastic and paper bags at checkout counters. The City Council passed it in 2012, saying the plastic bags, in particular, often end up as litter and are costly to clean up. 
And did bag litter rise after the San Fran ban? 
San Francisco’s 2007 ordinance banning single-use plastic bags at certain stores was the first such U.S. law, according to a March 28, 2007, San Francisco Chronicle news story. In November 2007, large grocery stores had to stop giving out single-use plastic bags; six months later, large chain pharmacies had to comply, the story said. 
Springer’s chief of staff, Travis McCormick, said by email that the lawmaker’s statement was based on the City of San Francisco Street Litter Re-Audit conducted in April-May 2008, which showed that plastic retail bags constituted 0.64 percent of all large litter (items more than 4 square inches). That was a 6.7 percent increase over the 0.6 percent share shown in the city’s April-May 2007 audit, McCormick said, so there was a slight bump in such litter despite the ban. 
San Francisco environmental department spokesman Guillermo Rodriguez told us by phone that retail plastic bag litter dropped the following year. He emailed us the city’s 2009 study, which showed plastic retail bags accounted for 0.52 percent of large litter. 
We looked over the city’s three litter audits, for 2007 through 2009, and here’s the thing: We’re talking about differences of about two plastic bags in each year’s litter samples. 
For the audits, observers counted pieces of litter at more than 100 sites, classified the found items as large or small, then tallied them in dozens of subcategories. 
In 2007, they recorded 23 plastic retail bags and pieces of such bags across all the checked sites. They found 25.5 of the bags and pieces of bags in 2008 -- and 23.5 in 2009. Those counts match up with the percentages McCormick cited and the percentage in the 2009 report. 
About half of San Francisco’s large litter in each audit came from ""fiber materials"" such as paper, cardboard and napkins. 
The ""second-most significant material type"" was plastic, accounting for 20 percent to 24 percent of total large litter in the surveys. In each of the three years, the largest category of plastic was ""miscellaneous,"" accounting for 4.7 percent to 9 percent of all large litter and defined as ""litter that is broken up or weathered such that auditors cannot identify it with certainty but can identify the litter as plastic."" 
Raw numbers of large litter items in San Francisco 2009 audit 
Source: The City of San Francisco Streets Litter Re-Audit 2009 
  
Rodriguez called the 2009 audit ""a better snapshot"" of the ban’s effects primarily because the 2008 audit was conducted only a few months after the ban started to take effect in November 2007. The 2008 litter audit counted litter samples taken from April 7 to April 18, 2008. That would have been before large pharmacies had to stop giving out disposable plastic bags on May 20, 2008, according to a Chronicle news story published that day. 
Finally, because Springer’s claim referred to ""litter from bags,"" we looked at San Francisco’s total bag data even though the city’s ban did not address paper bags. In contrast, Austin’s City Council banned both plastic and paper bags except for bags considered reusable -- such as ones with handles. 
  
Overall bag litter in San Francisco followed the same pattern as plastic retail bag litter -- rising in 2008 before falling below the 2007 and 2008 levels in 2009 (measured as a percentage of total large litter). Specifically, all paper and plastic bags made up 4.45 percent of large litter in 2007, 5.91 percent in 2008 and 4.22 percent in 2009. That’s a 33 percent increase in 2008; then the 2008 percentage dropped 28.6 percent in 2009. 
  
As of October 2012, San Francisco barred all retailers, large and small, from providing single-use plastic bags, according to other Chronicle news stories and news blog entries. Also, the city began requiring retailers to charge a 10-cent fee for each other bag they give out. Both requirements will apply to restaurants starting in October 2013. 
  
Our ruling 
Springer said San Francisco’s ""litter from bags actually increased after enacting their ban"" on plastic bags. 
  
A litter audit conducted before the ban took full effect found two more retail plastic bags than the previous year’s sampling. However, the next audit, launched after the ban had been fully in place for nearly a year, saw a two-bag drop. 
Maybe this means that such litter is decreasing, though we would want more research to reach definitive conclusions",Mostly False,"March 20, 2013"
"Says, ""I-205, six miles of which runs through my district, already carries more traffic than I-5.""","
Critics of a $3.4 billion plan to replace the current Interstate 5 bridge connecting Portland and Vancouver say that tolling the bridge will send drivers elsewhere -- spreading the rush hour gridlock around instead of solving it. Backers are relying on money from tolling to help pay for a new bridge.

That was the concern that Sen. Jackie Dingfelder, D-Portland, was channeling during a floor speech in opposition to House Bill 2800, which authorized the state to sell $450 million worth of bonds for the project, known as the Columbia River Crossing. The controversial bill has cleared both chambers and Gov. John Kitzhaber’s signature is expected Tuesday.

In her speech, Dingfelder said she worried that toll-wary travelers would seek out refuge on Interstate 205, using the Glenn Jackson Bridge to cross the Columbia.

""I-205, six miles of which runs through my district, already carries more traffic than I-5,"" Dingfelder said, so piling on more will hurt her neighborhood.

We snapped to attention at her assertion that I-205 carries more traffic. Has I-205, completed in 1983 as a bypass corridor for I-5 traffic, surpassed its older sibling with regards to traffic over the bridges?

We went to the Oregon Department of Transportation for the answer.

The agency tracks how many vehicles pass at certain points along all of its freeways. Those records show that in 2011, 123,900 ""average daily trips"" were recorded on I-5 at the Interstate Bridge. On I-205, 138,700 trips were recorded at the Glenn Jackson Bridge. The trips include both northbound and southbound.

So I-205 has 11 percent more traffic at the bridge. And we suppose that makes sense, since the Glenn Jackson Bridge is nearly twice as wide as the Interstate Bridge.

Ruling: 
We don’t know how many motorists would head over to I-205 to avoid a toll, but we do know that Dingfelder’s right. More cars already travel across the I-205 bridge than the I-5 bridge",True,"March 12, 2013"
"Says ""Did you know that the #KeystoneXL project is expected to create 20,000 American jobs, including more than 800 in Oregon?""","The Keystone XL pipeline is years from operating and may, in fact, never be built.

But that doesn’t mean the 1,700-mile project from Canada’s oil-rich tar sands in Alberta that would bring heavy crude to the Gulf of Mexico isn’t already pumping product, at least rhetorically. The U.S. State Department is expected to decide by the end of March whether to grant a permit that must be issued for the pipeline to be built. (The State Department is involved because the pipeline would cross an international border.)

It’s a high-stakes, high volume, politically charged exercise. Environmentalists have protested -- and been arrested -- in recent days in front of the White House as part of their campaign to pressure President Barack Obama to reject the project.

The other side has been just as active. That includes U.S. Rep. Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican who has long supported the pipeline as a way to make the United States more energy self-sufficient and boost the economy -- even in Oregon.

Here’s what he tweeted Jan. 29, 2013: ""Did you know that the#KeystoneXL project is expected to create 20,000 American jobs, including more than 800 in Oregon?""

That’s an attention-grabbing statement for two reasons. The first is the overall number of jobs at a time when the U.S. economy continues to struggle. The second concerns both numbers and geography. The pipeline as proposed would enter the U.S. in Montana and angle toward the Gulf on an eastward track through South Dakota and Nebraska. From there it continues to the Gulf.

Even if the route changes, the pipeline will be 1,000 miles (or more) from Oregon. So it’s fair to ask, how will a state so far removed from the project claim 800 jobs? Here’s a second, more basic question: Is the 20,000 ""American jobs"" cited by Walden and many other supporters of the project real?

Let’s take a look.

Sure enough, TransCanada, the company proposing the pipeline has cited the potential for 20,000 jobs. ""The $7 billion oil pipeline is the largest infrastructure project on the books in the U.S. right now,"" the company said in a 2012 news release. ""It would create 20,000 jobs: 13,000 in construction, 7,000 in manufacturing.""

There have been numerous analyses and copious filings by the company itself in pursuit of the permit.

And yet, the conclusion that 20,000 jobs would be created is more than a bit slippery.

A 2011 study by Cornell University is absolute: ""The company’s claim that KXL will create 20,000 direct construction and manufacturing jobs in the U.S is not substantiated,"" it states.

One of the more troublesome devices is this: The total is a reflection of something called ""job years."" Why is that important?  A ""job year"" is a measure of one job performed for one year. That means if a single worker stays on the job for the two years the pipeline construction is expected to last, that single worker counts as two jobs.

The measure might be accepted -- and used -- by economists but it’s not what the average person thinks when hearing the word ""job."" TransCanada says the 20,000 jobs include 13,000 direct jobs, mostly construction and 7,000 indirect jobs. If the project takes two years, it means 6,500 actual direct jobs (plus or minus), which is the number the State Department uses.

Calculated that way, the actual number of people employed by the pipeline moves closer to 10,000, or some 6,500 workers in construction and 3,500 in manufacturing. Not 20,000.
   
Here’s another important point: These construction jobs are not permanent and, for the most part, aren’t necessarily local. The positions will disappear when the pipeline is complete. The State Department estimates that only 10 to 15 percent of these jobs can be filled with workers from communities in the pipeline’s path.

As for the broader (and always murky) world of indirect jobs, the study  -- by Lara Skinner and Sean Sweeney at Cornell’s Global Labor Institute -- raises questions about an analysis by the Perryman Group, which was hired by TransCanada to look at economic impacts.

""The Perryman study is based on expenditure and sourcing data provided by TransCanada,
and none of that information has been disclosed or subject to independent review,"" the Cornell study says.

By their calculations, Perryman uses a multiplier of 18 job-years for every $1 million spent on the project. Skinner and Sweeney write that a more acceptable multiplier is 11 job-years for every $1 million spent.

""So a reasonable estimate of the total incremental U.S. jobs from KXL construction is about one-third of the figure estimated in the Perryman study and used by industry to advocate for the construction of KXL,"" the Cornell study concludes.

Let’s move on to the second part of Walden’s claim, that the pipeline would bring ""800 jobs"" to Oregon.

Unlike a lot of states far removed from the actual pipeline route, there is an official thread to Oregon.

In a January 2012 news release promoting the pipeline’s economic value, TransCanada says this: ""Construction of Keystone XL is expected to create 7000 manufacturing jobs.  Key support companies include: Welspun (pipe from Arkansas), Cameron (valves from Louisiana), Siemens (pumps, motors and related control equipment manufactured in Oregon, Ohio and Indiana) and dozens of other companies manufacturing everything from nuts and bolts to complex electrical control equipment.""

That’s as specific as it gets, however. When asked for source material to back this claim of 800 jobs, Walden’s office referred to a Chamber of Commerce study. Sure enough, the publication says there will be 838 jobsattributable to the pipelinein Oregon by 2020. (Once again, the use of ""jobs"" is not what an average person expects.)

Chamber of Commerce spokeswoman Blair Latoff Holmes said the number was taken from a study commissioned by the pro-pipeline American Petroleum Institute, written by the Canadian Energy Research Institute and released in June 2011.


All of these studies are vulnerable to criticism because the formulas are by necessity often more art than science and the methodology used is not clearly expressed. That’s why the conclusions should be consumed with caution.

But tone matters too. In his statement, Walden seems absolute even while there is no clarification that the 20,000 figure refers to ""job years,"" which is much different than the way ""job"" is commonly understood.

Walden has a somewhat stronger case on the Oregon job claim, mostly because TransCanada mentions Oregon by name as one state that would produce equipment needed for the project. As for the number 800, however, it is at best a guess.

That’s a pipeline full of uncertainty",Mostly False,"February 27, 2013"
"Says ""If Oregon’s Legislature simply authorizes $450 million for the CRC, it will … leave Oregon holding the bag for a great deal more cost responsibility.""","
Lawmakers in Oregon and Washington are expected to vote this year on local funding for the Columbia River Crossing, raising the stakes of the political wrangling around the replacement of the Interstate 5 bridge.

Inthe early planning stages of the CRC, officials in Oregon and Washington agreed to split the cost of the bridge, which could be as much as $3.5 billion. Oregon’s Gov. John Kitzhaber included $450 million in state funding for the bridge in his proposed 2013-15 budget. (The rest of the money is supposed to come from Washington, the federal government and tolls on the bridge.)

Metro Councilor Bob Stacey says Oregon could wind up paying more, thanks to provisions of a 2012 bill passed by the Washington Legislature that approves tolling of the new Interstate 5 corridor. Amendments to that bill put a $3.412 billion funding cap on the project and barred tolling on the Interstate 205 bridge, which also crosses the Columbia River between Portland and Vancouver.

In a memo to the Metro Council, Stacey said that the Oregon Legislature needs to fight back with provisions of its own -- making light rail a priority and limiting Oregon’s spending on the project to $450 million. ""If Oregon’s Legislature simply authorizes $450 million for the CRC, it will be implicitly accepting Washington’s limitations, which will leave Oregon holding the bag for a great deal more cost responsibility — or with a great deal less from the CRC project for our communities.""

Mega-projects like interstate bridges are complicated, but we were surprised to hear that something Washington did could leave Oregon ""holding the bag.""  We thought we’d check.

First, let’s look at tolling. Federal law generally prohibits tolling on an interstate bridge unless the money is used to pay for the bridge. That makes the Washington Legislature’s prohibition of tolling on the I-205 bridge meaningless because neither state could do it without a federal waiver.

With no tolls on I-205, Stacey could be right in saying that drivers would avoid the I-5 bridge and go to I-205. It is also possible, as he says, that tolls from the new bridge could be less than projected. That would create a shortfall in paying for the bridge.

If that happens, who is holding the bag?

To answer that, let’s go back to the original interstate agreement to build the bridge. In 2006, Oregon and Washington representatives signed an intergovernmental agreement stating that both state transportation departments are ""to jointly be responsible for the cost of the Columbia River Crossing Project.""

Sounded like an even split to us, but to be sure,we checked with officials in both Oregon and Washington.

Pat Egan, chair of the Oregon Transportation Commission, says jointly means equally. ""That’s the declared working agreement,"" Egan said.

Egan said he’s confident the final price tag for the bridge will be closer to $3 billion than $3.5 billion. But even if the bridge exceeds the cap,  he said, it will be up to both legislative bodies to approve more funding.

North of the river, we talked to Sen. Ann Rivers, the La Center Republican who wrote the Washington project cap amendment. She wants to control the costs but doesn’t see Washington doing that unilaterally. ""I think we can count on overruns and I expect them to be split evenly,"" she said.

But what about that cap that Washington passed?

History shows it may be better to think of the cap as a goal. Legislative bodies pass capital plans, including caps. Sometimes costs go up. Lawmakers don’t like it, but they usually approve more money. The city of Portland approved additional funds for the Portland Aerial Tram when it went over budget, for instance, and the Oregon Transportation Commission did the same this year for the rebuilding of U.S. 20.

In the end, Stacey’s right that if legislators greenlight the CRC, the state could ultimately owe more than $450 million on its share of the bridge. But setting a cap on the project or limiting Oregon’s share with legislative riders won’t stop that. And thanks to the agreement between Oregon and Washington to pay for the bridge jointly, if Oregon ever needs to pay more, Washington would need to join in.

PolitiFact Oregon doesn’t do prophecy. We can’t say whether the bridge will be over budget -- as much as history might tempt us to offer a guess.

What we can say is that the Washington toll rule won’t matter. The Washington Legislature’s cap won’t matter. Bottom line? The intergovernmental agreement covers the responsibility. Both states are left holding the bag.

"""The 12 hottest years on record have come in the last 15 years.""","
During his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama touted the country’s progress in reducing carbon pollution emissions but added that recent advances in fuel efficiency and renewable energy have not done enough to curb climate change.

""For the sake of our children and our future, we must do more to combat climate change,"" Obama said. ""Now, it’s true that no single event makes a trend. But the fact is, the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15. Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods – all are now more frequent and more intense.""

In 2012, the country experienced severe weather threats including drought, a devastating Hurricane Sandy and severe thunderstorms. We decided to fact-check whether the 12 hottest years on record have all come since 1998.

The White House directed us to NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which tracks global surface temperatures. The institute concluded that 2012 was the ninth-warmest year on record, with 2010 and 2005 being the all-time highs.

For the contiguous United States, 2012 was the country’s warmest year yet. It beat the previous record by one degree Fahrenheit. (Science nerds can read more about how these temperatures are calculated here and here.)

Reto Ruedy, a program manager at the Goddard Institute, told PolitiFact that the institute’s data produces the following ranking of hottest years. Items on the same line are statistically tied.

1-2: 2010, 2005
3-8: 2007, 1998, 2002, 2003, 2006, 2009
9-12: 2012, 2011, 2001, 2004
13: 2008
14: 1997
15: 1995

This analysis shows that 13 of the warmest years have occurred in the past 15 years. Alternately, one could say that 12 of the warmest years came in the last 13.

We see a few other issues to note.

• The NASA data set isn’t the only one available. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also analyzes global surface temperatures using its own methodology. The two measurements diverge somewhat -- NOAA considers 2012 the 10th-warmest year on record since records began in 1880, rather than the ninth.

However, NOAA’s data for land and ocean temperature anomalies shows that 14 of the past 15 years were the hottest on record.

• There are other ways one could measure ""hottest years."" Kevin Trenberth, a scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research, agreed with the 13-of-15 calculation. But he added that the NASA and NOAA values refer to global mean surface temperature. ""One could define ‘hottest’ in other ways, such as by how much Arctic sea ice there is,"" he said.

Our ruling

Obama said, ""The 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15."" Data from NASA shows 13 of the hottest years on record have come in the last 15, and by a different data set produced by NOAA, 14 of the hottest years on record have come in the last 15",True,"February 15, 2013"
"Wisconsin’s laws ""ranked the worst in the world for mining investment.""","With the prospect of thousands of jobs being created in northern Wisconsin, Republican legislators and business leaders are once again leading a push for changes to the state’s mining laws.

Gogebic Taconite has continued to express interest in spending $1.5 billion to open an iron ore mine in far northwestern Wisconsin. Before it proceeds, the company wants lawmakers to write new laws specifically for iron mining that would relax some environmental rules and provide greater certainty about the regulatory process.

A bill to accommodate Gogebic narrowly died in 2012 and with Republicans back in control of both houses and the governor’s office, a renewed campaign to secure passage is under way. Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the state’s largest business group, has aggressively pushed for the bill’s approval.

In interviews and public hearing testimony, the group’s chief lobbyist, Scott Manley, has spent months trying to put Wisconsin’s mining laws into perspective. At a Jan. 23, 2013, public hearing before a joint legislative committee considering mining legislation, Manley had this to say about the need for mining legislation:

""A recent survey of 500 mining companies throughout the world by the Fraser Institute … found alarming evidence that Wisconsin’s environmental regulations and regulatory framework discourage investment in mining jobs.

""For example, of the 79 states and countries analyzed in the survey, Wisconsin’s environmental regulations ranked the worst in the world for mining investment.  Eighty-five percent of the respondents characterized Wisconsin’s environmental laws as either a ‘strong deterrent to investment’ or ‘would not invest due to this factor.’ The Fraser Institute survey diagnoses a significant problem with Wisconsin’s mining laws.""

Manley has made similar statements in the past, including a Nov. 30, 2012, interview with talk show host Charlie Sykes, and in a Nov. 24, 2012, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel opinion piece.

So, is Wisconsin really worst in the world for mining investment?

Let’s start with the study.

Since 1997, the Fraser Institute, an independent Canadian think tank, has taken a look at the state of the mining industry around the world. The group says it conducts ""an annual survey of metal mining and exploration companies to assess how mineral endowments and public policy factors such as taxation and regulation affect exploration investment. Survey results represent the opinions of executives and exploration managers in mining and mining consulting companies operating around the world.""

The survey Manley cites is Fraser’s 2010-11 report. The results were gathered between Oct. 19 and Dec. 3, 2010. That time frame overlapped the election for governor won by Republican Scott Walker, but  was well before discussion on mining legislation heated up.

There have also been two reports issued since then -- and those reports don’t include Wisconsin. So, Manley is picking an outdated report to make his point.

What’s more, it is a survey. The results are determined by whoever chooses to respond. It is not scientific. So, the conclusions you can draw from it are limited.

In the survey in question, Fraser sent it to 3,000 mining and exploration firms and executives, and received responses from 494, or about 16.5 percent.

All told, the responses addressed the economic and political climates for mining in 79 regions around the world. That underlines how the results are dictated by who responded, not by any effort to represent all states or countries in a proportional way. Nor does it require any particular knowledge of how one state’s regulations compare to, say, another country’s regulations.

The findings, when listed as the top 10 and bottom 10 geographic regions, were pretty grim for Wisconsin.

""The bottom 10 scorers are Indonesia, Zimbabwe, Wisconsin, Madagascar, India, Guatemala, Bolivia, DRC (Congo), Venezuela, and Honduras,"" the report said. ""Unfortunately, except for Wisconsin these are all developing nations which most need the new jobs and increased prosperity mining that can produce.""

The report included two comments about Wisconsin. In each case, the respondent is described only in vague terms.

""Make everyone do without any mining products for a month or a year in Wisconsin. Outlaw all mining materials.
— Producer company with more than US $50M revenue, Senior management""
           
""Wisconsin properly evaluates the economic impact of mineral development to job growth and economic stability.
— Consulting company, Consultant""

So how did Wisconsin wind up so low on the list?

Fraser conducts its surveys anonymously, and keeps most of the raw data secret. However, there are indications that few of the responses pertained to Wisconsin. And the responses received about Wisconsin were strongly negative about the economic and policy climate for mining in the state.

Some examples:

-- One key question -- asking for a rating for regions that had the ""most/least favorable policies toward mining"" -- received only 13 responses about Wisconsin. That is based on a  raw number (one of the few provided) that was included in a spreadsheet accompanying the report. Wisconsin received no ""most favorable"" votes, and 13 ""least favorable.""

That compares with 116 responses for Quebec, deemed the most favorable region, and 68 for Venezuela, the least favorable.

-- Fraser dropped Wisconsin from its two subsequent surveys, for 2011-12, as well as the soon-to-be-released 2012-13 study, according to the group’s survey coordinator, Alana Wilson. Regions are dropped when there are fewer than 10 respondents for that area.

-- Asked about ""uncertainty concerning the administration, interpretation and enforcement of existing regulations,"" 88 percent said Wisconsin’s situation was negative for investment in mining, while 12 percent said state rules were either a mild deterrent or no deterrent to such investment.

In short, the responses about Wisconsin were heavily negative and appear to have come from as few as 13, or 2.6 percent, of the 494 responses received by Fraser in 2010. (A spokesman said executives from Gogebic did not participate in the survey.)

Manley said in an interview he was unaware of the details about the Fraser survey, other than that it was sent to about 3,000 mining industry officials. He said he didn’t know about the small sample size or that Wisconsin was dropped from subsequent surveys.

""The people that they are asking are the people who are interested in making that investment or not"" in mining, Manley said. ""I can’t think of another survey that has the breadth of taking the pulse of the mining industry.""

Manley said the survey results were consistent with the situation in Wisconsin, at least in terms of mining regulations, and history.

He said that the current state law, in effect since 1998, amounts to a ""mining moratorium"" because it sets unreasonably high standards for establishment of a new mine. Also, he said, only one mine has received a permit under the existing state law. Dating to 1974, the Flambeau mine near Ladysmith that operated for a short time and is now closed. (Lead miners were active in the 1800s, including some before the state was established. Besides Flambeau, other mines operated but not under modern regulations.)  

Manley said the Fraser report puts Wisconsin in the same group as developing countries and ""from our standpoint it underscores the need for reform.""

WMC says Wisconsin is among the ""worst in the world"" for mining investment, according to a study by a Canadian think tank. To be sure, the state landed in the bottom 10, along with numerous developing countries and no other U.S. states.

"""We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas.""","
President Barack Obama said in his State of the Union address that the country’s progress toward energy independence can be measured in miles per gallon.

""Today, no area holds more promise than our investments in American energy. After years of talking about it, we're finally poised to control our own energy future,"" he said. ""We produce more oil at home than we have in 15 years. We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas and the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar, with tens of thousands of good, American jobs to show for it.""

A lot of energy claims are packed in that statement. Here, we’ll examine whether we’ve ""doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas.""

We reached out to the White House asking for backup to this claim but did not receive any. But back in 2011, the EPA announced a plan, in partnership with a dozen automakers, to increase average fuel economy to 54.5 miles per gallon for cars and light-duty trucks. (That figure represents a combined city/highway rating as tested in a lab. In real-world driving, the EPA estimates drivers would average closer to 43 mpg.)

Is that for cars coming off the assembly line now? Not hardly. The 54.5 mpg benchmark is the goal for model year 2025 vehicles.

Fuel efficiency is gradually increasing on the way to the 2025 goal. When he took office in 2009, federal standards called for an average rating of 27.5 mpg. For 2013 vehicles, the standard is 30.5 mpg. In 2016, it rises to 34.1.

So comparing fuel efficiency in 2009 and now, there’s an increase of 11 percent -- not nearly double.

Our ruling

Obama said the U.S. has ""doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas,"" which clearly sounds as though cars on the road today are running at twice their earlier fuel efficiency. But he was comparing a real number with a projected one, a standard for vehicles manufactured more than a decade from now.

Says Texas ranks first among the states in the amount of carbon dioxide emitted and toxic chemicals released into water.,"Reacting to Gov. Rick Perry’s pitch and woo of Californians, a Sacramento Bee editorial played off of a radio ad in which Perry urged businesses there to check out Texas.

The Feb. 6, 2013, editorial listed various ways Texas isn’t so great. We’ve since piled up related fact checks, here.

For this article, we’re reviewing this Texas reference in the editorial: ""Come check out a state that ranks... first in the amount of carbon dioxide emitted and first in the amount of toxic chemicals released into water.""

No. 1 polluter, times two?

Stuart Leavenworth, who oversees the Bee editorial page, did not offer backup for the reference to toxic chemical releases. But he pointed us to a Texas news account about carbon dioxide emissions.

For our look, we’ll consider CO2, then toxic chemicals put into water, looking both at raw amounts and the totals adjusted for state populations and economic output.

Carbon dioxide emissions The Jan. 12, 2012, Houston Chronicle news article says that according to federal data released that day, Texas releases far more greenhouse gases into the air than any other state. The story continues: ""Texas' coal-fired power plants and oil refineries generated 294 million tons of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases in 2010, more than the next two states – Pennsylvania and Florida – combined, the data show.""

The story says the Environmental Protection Agency released the data from the largest industrial sources across the country for the first time as part of a broader effort to reduce emissions linked to global warming. It says the agency ""collected data from more than 6,700 industrial facilities that release at least 25,000 tons of greenhouse gases into the air a year. The threshold is comparable to the emissions from burning 131 railcars of coal, the EPA said.""

To our inquiries, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the Sierra Club in Texas each guided us to even more recent EPA data on industrial emissions of greenhouse gases, the primary driver of climate change, the federal agency says.

And on the agency’s website, it’s possible to check on each state’s industrial emissions of eight gases, among them carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons.

According to the posted information, Texas industrial facilities in 2011 emitted 391 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, mainly produced from the burning of fossil fuels. The database indicates that industrial CO2 emissions in other populous states were lower: California (95 million metric tons); New York (44); Florida (123); Illinois (41); Pennsylvania (141): Ohio (142); Michigan (89); Georgia (82); North Carolina (66); and New Jersey (23). Louisiana, on the Gulf Coast like Texas, had 132 million metric tons of CO2 emissions, according to the agency.

It’s no surprise, perhaps, that Texas plants make the state No. 1 in industrial carbon dioxide emissions. Neil Carman, who directs the Clean Air program for the Sierra Club’s Lone Star chapter, told us by email: ""Realize that Texas has more large oil refineries, major chemical and petrochemical plants, hundreds of natural gas processing plants, Portland cement kilns, carbon black plants, etc. than any other state because of the strength of the oil & gas industry and the large geographical size and population base as well.""

Carman’s comment underscored a hitch in the federal information. The data does not reflect total gases emitted in each state--just those attributed to industrial facilities.

Yet Al Armendariz of the Sierra Club guided us to a spreadsheet prepared by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, based on its analysis of emissions from the consumption of fossil fuels, estimating that in 2010, Texas had 653 million metric tons of CO2 emissions. California placed second, at 370 million metric tons, and Pennsylvania was third, at 257 million metric tons.

So, Texas has been No. 1 in total CO2 emissions. However, we calculated, Texas would have tied for 13th among the states if each state’s emissions were adjusted for its population that year, as gauged by the U.S. Census Bureau. Less populous states led after this adjustment, topped by Wyoming (108 metric tons per capita); North Dakota (76); Alaska (56); Louisiana (50); Montana (36); Kentucky (35); Indiana (34); Iowa (30); Alabama and New Mexico (28); Nebraska and Oklahoma (27). Kansas and Texas each had 26 metric tons of CO2 emissions per resident. California emissions were 10 metric tons per resident.

Toxic chemical releases Wondering how Texas ranks in toxic chemicals released into water, we queried Luke Metzger, who heads Environment Texas, which describes itself as a statewide citizen-funded advocate for clean air, clean water and open spaces.

Metzger pointed out that the EPA maintains a Toxic Release Inventory, tabulating reported releases into waterways of 231 toxic chemicals or classes of toxic pollutants. Environment Texas drew on the inventory for an April 2012 report stating that Texas ranked fourth nationally in 2010 with 14.3 million pounds of toxic discharges.

Top Ten States by Toxic Industrial Releases Into Waterways, 2010 (Millions of Pounds) 

Source: Environment Texas, April 2012 report.

According to the report, Indiana had the most toxic releases, more than 27 million pounds, followed by Virginia (18 million pounds) and Nebraska (14.7 million pounds). Nationally, 226 million pounds were released in 2010, the report says. It cautions, too, that the totals solely reflect industrial releases, not accounting for other sources including wastewater treatment plants and agriculture-related facilities. Still, the report says, the federal inventory is the ""best and most complete set of data available.""

Adjusting these figures for each state’s 2010 population changes the rank order, putting Texas at No. 10, with toxic releases of 0.6 pounds per resident--and that is also without checking per-capita tallies for 40 remaining states. On a per-person basis, Nebraska led the nine other states, at 8 pounds per resident, followed by Indiana (4) and Virginia (2). Every other of the 10 states had a ratio of less than two pounds per resident.

By telephone, a consultant to Environment Texas, Tony Dutzik of the Boston-based Frontier Group, said another way to gauge CO2 emissions and toxic releases into water by state is to compare totals compared to each state’s Gross Domestic Product, which indicates its economic activity. We tried that for the 2010 toxic releases by using state GDPs for 2010, as posted by the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. By this filter, Nebraska had the most toxic releases per dollar of GDP, Texas the 10th-highest--again, only among the 10 states identified as having the most overall industrial releases that year.

We also applied the GDP filter to the 10 states, including Texas, that had the greatest industrial CO2 emissions in 2010. By this metric, Texas was tied with Kansas for 12th; Wyoming ranked first.

By email, Metzger sent a spreadsheet, which he said Dutzik had built from more recent data posted by the EPA, indicating that Texas ranked third overall among the states in industrial toxic releases into water in 2011, trailing Indiana and Virginia, but running ahead of Georgia.

Our ruling

The editorial said Texas ranks first nationally in the amount of carbon dioxide emitted and toxic chemicals released into water.

We can see a basis for the first part of the claim, though not the second. Texas ranks No. 1 in CO2 emissions, by a wide margin. But it trailed about a dozen states in 2010 after each state's emissions were adjusted for the state's population or economic output.

In 2011, Texas ranked third in total industrial releases of toxic chemicals into water; it was fourth nationally the previous year--and adjusting for each state’s population or economic output leaves Texas in 10th place among those states with the most industrial toxic releases that year",Half True,"February 13, 2013"
"Tide gauges measuring sea level in Rhode Island since 1930 have risen ""maybe about 10 inches since that time.""","Sandy, the so-called ""superstorm"" that struck the East Coast in October 2012, did more than produce massive damage. It also got a lot of people talking about climate change.

Climate scientists say Earth is warming, and most say it’s due to polluting gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. Stronger storms are one predicted result.

And scientists say the storms are going to be even more damaging because the excess heat will cause sea level to rise, both by a melting of the polar ice caps and because water expands as it warms.

When Janet Freedman, a coastal geologist with Rhode Island's Coastal Resources Management Council, talked about the risk of coastal flooding during an appearance on WJAR-TV’s ""10 News Conference,"" she said the local rise in sea level is pretty clear.

The levels ""have been rising,"" she said. ""In Rhode Island we have two long-term tide gauges that have been measuring the sea level since 1930 and we've seen that they've risen maybe about 10 inches since that time.

""But we anticipate that with global warming, that's going to be faster, it's going to accelerate. Most models show we'll see a foot of sea-level rise as early as 2030 but definitely 2050 we expect to see sea levels that are higher than they are now.""

PolitiFact doesn't rate predictions, so we focused on whether sea level has really risen about 10 inches over the past eight decades -- an average of 1.25 inches every 10 years.

We contacted Freedman, who sent us to several sources.

The Sea Levels Online website, part of the Tides & Currents portion of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration website, has data from tide gauges around the world. Selecting ""Rhode Island"" sends you to data from gauges in Newport and Providence.

The Newport data show that from 1930 to 2006, the mean water level has risen by 2.58 millimeters -- about a tenth of an inch -- per year. Data that take the readings through 2011 show that the overall rate over that 81-year-period has actually increased to 2.70 mm/year. We calculate the rise from 1930 to 2012 to be 211.6 mm or 8.7 inches. That's not 10 inches, but Freedman said ""maybe about.""

(It's also important to note that there is a margin of error in these numbers because they are averages based on readings that fluctuate due to waves, tides, winds and other factors. The average may be 8.7 inches but the real number could be as high as 9.3 inches or as low as 8.1 inches. The odds of it being outside this ""confidence interval"" during that period are 1 in 20.)

The Providence tide gauge hasn't produced as much data. Records begin around 1940 and there is a large gap in the 1950s. But the overall rate as of 2011 is also lower: 2.19 mm per year. If we extrapolate that back to 1930 and forward to 2012, that's 179.6 mm or 7.1 inches since 1930. Although the margin of error could take it as high as 8.0 inches, somewhat further from 10 inches than the Newport data.

We also contacted Jon Boothroyd of the University of Rhode Island, who is designated by the U.S. Geological Survey as the state geologist. He crunches the tide gauge numbers a bit differently, taking the monthly data and averaging it for a year. He has also included more recent data. His estimate: 269 mm per 100 years. Over 82 years, that would be 220.6 mm, which is 8.7 inches as well. (The range here is 9.4 inches to 7.9 inches.)

However, Boothroyd said that if you look at the actual year-to-year annual readings from Newport between 1930 and 2011, the increase has been about 270 mm, or 10.6 inches.

Boothroyd said he doesn't use the Providence tide gauge data because he had doubts about it -- the readings are too far off from the Newport readings.

Sea level can fluctuate if land rises or falls, for example. But between Providence and Newport, ""the bedrock and the conditions are so close to one another, it doesn't make sense why that rate of sea level rise is lower than it is in Newport,"" he said. The gauge in Providence ""is on a pier, and I don't think the pilings on that pier are sunk to bedrock. So the pier could be slowly subsiding, but the gauge shows exactly the opposite. So I don't use that number because I can't understand it. It's a really sticky wicket.""

These days, satellites offer the best measurement of sea levels, and they do it every 10 days across most of the world, said Steven Nerem a climate researcher at the University of Colorado at Boulder.

""The satellites are all referenced to Earth's geocenter, so our data are not affected by the land motion,"" he said.

In addition, coastal temperatures, winds, the saltiness of the water, atmospheric pressure and ocean currents all have an effect on the height of the water at individual locations, which is why researchers have to use a global average and look at long-term trends.

For example, when the Pacific warms during an El Nino, ""you have more precipitation over the oceans than in the continents, and you get a short-term increase in sea level,"" said Nerem ""When you have La Nina (Pacific cooling), you get more precipitation over the continents and the water gets stored there for some period of time, so you have a temporary lowering of sea level.""

According to the satellite data, available at the website sealevel.colorado.edu, the global sea level has risen by 3.2 mm per year since 1993. If you assume that the rise has been steady since 1930, that would translate to an average worldwide increase of 10.3 inches. (Range: 9.0 inches up to 11.6 inches.)

Is the pace of sea level rise increasing?

""That's the $10 million question,"" said Nerem. ""Over the last 100 years there is a suggestion that  there is a small acceleration. If you just look at the satellite data, we don't see an acceleration. So over the last 20 years, it may just be too small, given all this variability, to detect.""

Boothroyd, however, said, ""There is some indication that worldwide sea level has risen at a faster rate since 1990. Our graph suggests that is true for Newport"" citing the uptick in 2010 and 2011.

Freedman said Boothroyd's numbers, which show a slightly higher annual increase, may be pointing to sea levels rising faster today. ""This trend seems to suggest that we are seeing acceleration in sea level rise over the last 20 years, but because there is so much variability in sea levels we really need forty years of sea levels to say that with scientific certainty.""

Our ruling

Janet Freedman, a geologist with Rhode Island's Coastal Resources Management Council, said, ""In Rhode Island we have two long-term tide gauges that have been measuring the sea level since 1930 and we've seen that they've risen maybe about 10 inches since that time.""

Her ""maybe about"" phrase gives her some wiggle room.

The long-term trend in Newport doesn't quite measure up to 10 inches. It's 8.7 inches. But the actual annual measurements at the beginning and end of that time period meet the truth test, mostly because of a steep -- and not explained -- increase over the last few years.

The Providence tide gauge data, on the other hand, show a much smaller trend over that time period -- it would be just over 7 inches.

Freedman's overarching point that sea levels have been rising is certainly true, and that's borne out by satellite data.

Pinning down the actual size of the rise is as difficult as measuring the precise height of a wave",Mostly True,"February 8, 2013"
"A Republican-sponsored Wisconsin mining bill ""will take at least seven years to create jobs.""","Thousands of jobs are the promise of a four-mile-long iron ore mine proposed for far northern Wisconsin, which would be the first such operation in the Badger State in more than 15 years.

But how quickly would the mother lode of jobs come?

State Senate Minority Leader Chris Larson, D-Milwaukee, sees a lengthy wait, even if the Legislature adopts a Republican bill to speed part of the process of approving the mine.

On Jan. 15, 2013, Larson gave a Democratic response to GOP Gov. Scott Walker’s state of the state address, which also dangled the prospect of several thousand jobs connected to the mine.

""Tonight, we should be honest with the people of Wisconsin,"" Larson said. ""You just heard calls for bipartisanship from our governor. But the policies he proposed were not bipartisan. Funding an unproven, unaccountable gamble with our children’s future is not bipartisan.

""Forcing through an extreme mining bill that will take at least seven years to create jobs is not bipartisan.""

Is Larson right about how long it would take?

Digging into history

Mining in northern Wisconsin dates to 4,000 B.C., when Native Americans extracted copper along the shores of Lake Superior. By the 19th century, iron in Iron County, where part of the new mine would be located, had created prodigious prosperity. ""Hundreds of people are arriving daily from all parts of the country and millionaires are being made by the score,"" gushed an 1886 article in the Chicago Tribune.  

Over time, the industry fell off. The state’s last operating mine, which held gold and copper near Ladysmith in northwestern Wisconsin, shut down in 1997.

But talk of new boom times returned in November 2010.

That was when Gogebic Taconite said it wanted to invest $1.5 billion to develop an open-pit iron ore mine in Iron and Ashland counties, some 300 miles northwest of Milwaukee. (Gogebic refers to the iron-bearing region of northern Wisconsin and northwestern Michigan; taconite is low-grade iron ore.) The company is a subsidiary of the Cline Group, a privately owned coal-mining company headed by college dropout and Florida billionaire Christopher Cline, whose yacht is named Mine Games.

The economic impact of such an investment could be big -- once the mine is up and running.

An April 2011 study by an economic consultant hired by Gogebic Taconite estimated that once operating, the mine would create 2,834 long-term jobs, including 700 direct mining jobs -- with the direct jobs averaging nearly $83,000 per year in salary and benefits.

Two months later, we rated Mostly True a statement from Wisconsin’s largest business organization that the mine could operate for 100 years and generate billions of dollars of economic activity.

There was a big hitch, however: Gogebic Taconite said it needed new regulations to provide more certainty in seeking a state permit.

Republicans controlled the Legislature. But a GOP-sponsored bill to ease the state part of the state-federal permit process failed on a 17-16 vote in the Senate in March 2012. Gogebic said it was abandoning its plans.

On the day after the Walker and Larson speeches, Republicans introduced a new bill, similar to the previous one. It reignited job creation claims and warnings, including some made by Native Americans near the site, about threats to water and land. Hundreds of people and extra security were on hand at the state Capitol for a Jan. 23, 2013, hearing on the bill.

How long for jobs?

We asked Larson spokeswoman Gillian Morris for evidence that it would take at least seven years under the bill for jobs to be created. She cited three things: -- A January 2013 letter from the the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which says the GOP bill might require the corps to do an environmental analysis separate from one done by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. That could add time to the corps’ review process, which ""generally takes from two to four years or more,"" according to a corps timeline. -- Comments by Tim Sullivan, then-chairman of the Wisconsin Mining Association, who told state lawmakers in November 2012 it would take years to construct a mine.  ""We're not talking a year or two years. You're talking five, six years out, potentially even further, depending on how the permit process goes,"" he said. -- Likely delays caused by litigation. Indeed, state Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, called a lawsuit ""inevitable,"" but Larson didn’t cite any time frame on litigation delays. We’ll also note that Gogebic Taconite itself, when first announcing its plans, said the regulatory process alone could span five to seven years.

So, there are indications the permitting process could take up to seven years, but not evidence that it would take at least that long.

And jobs would be created along the way.

For his part, Assembly Majority Leader Scott Suder, R-Abbottsford, a sponsor of the new GOP mining bill, envisions a shorter timeline. He told us the environmental review and permitting process would take about two years and that the mine could be up and running in less than two years after that.

Suder also emphasized that some number of jobs would be created long before the mine opens. He said preliminary tasks would include groundwater well drilling, water and soil testing, metallurgical, hydrological and other engineering, and design for a water supply and a railroad line.

DNR mining expert Ann Coakley concurred.

Gogebic Taconite would need people to do environmental studies and to drill at least several hundred wells, she told us. Surface and groundwater testing would need to be done for up to two years. That and other work would need to be done in order for the company to write an environmental impact statement, which is needed to obtain permits. ""That’s a large-scale undertaking,"" costing probably $10 million and likely requiring at least dozens of jobs, Coakley said.

Coakley also noted that while the process for obtaining permission from the Corps of Engineers could take several years, the DNR, under the GOP bill, would have to finish its review of Gogebic Taconite’s application within 420 days. If the DNR gave its permission, the company could start construction on facilities such as a wastewater treatment plant, creating more jobs.

After permission from the Army Corps is granted, construction of the mine itself -- which Gogebic Taconite says would take two years and create 3,175 jobs -- could begin. Coakley said she didn’t expect it would take seven years to get to that point.

Larson said a Republican-sponsored mining bill ""will take at least seven years to create jobs.""

The evidence Larson cited referred to how long it would take to open the mine, which is the when the largest number of jobs will be in play.

"""Wind powers nearly 13 million homes across the country.""","
While some complained about the fine print in the fiscal cliff deal, a local environmental activist was pleased with one portion of the bill and said something about it that seemed worthwhile to fact-check.

Environment Georgia policy advocate Jennette Gayer sent out a news release thanking federal lawmakers for continuing key tax credits for wind power.

""Wind powers nearly 13 million homes across the country and states like Texas, the number one wind energy producer in the country, generate a little over 30 million (megawatt hours per year),"" Gayer wrote.

PolitiFact Georgia wondered about Gayer’s claim that wind powers nearly 13 million homes in the United States. Is that true?

Gayer pointed us to a couple of websites she used to back up her claim. PolitiFact Georgia was on its way down the windy road of wind energy.

The development of wind energy, harvested by wind turbines, began in the 1970s. It’s grown in the decades since, but it is still a very small amount (3 percent) of the energy that’s produced in the United States, federal officials and researchers say. President Barack Obama talked energetically about wind power on the campaign trail last year, saying it’s creating jobs and it is an important alternative energy source. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney had no plans to continue the tax credits.

In 1992, the federal government began offering tax credits to individuals and companies for wind energy production as part of the Energy Policy Act. For every kilowatt hour of power from wind, the government gives the producer a tax credit worth 2.2 cents. At the time, the U.S. had 1.5 gigawatts of installed wind capacity. A gigawatt is the equivalent of 1 billion watts of electricity. A standard light bulb uses 100 watts.

Most of the nation’s wind energy is produced in Texas, the Plains states and the West Coast, analysts say. Very little comes from the South.

""It’s less windy in the Southeast, so there’s not a lot of technology to generate that energy,"" said Eric Lantz, a research analyst with the federal government’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

Some organizations, such as the Institute for Energy Research, call the tax credits a ""boondoggle."" The institute, citing a study by the American Tradition Institute, says the costs of wind power is more expensive than other forms of energy generation, such as coal, natural gas and nuclear energy.

By 1999, federal officials say they saw an increase in wind capacity. The American Wind Energy Association, a prominent group that supports the expanded use of wind energy, reported this past August that the U.S. had reached the 50-gigawatt milestone.

The association’s estimate is, Lantz said, about a year ahead of the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Lantz said he reviewed the EIA’s most recent numbers and believes the association’s 50-gigawatt claim is on target.

So how many homes can 50 gigawatts power? Lantz looked at U.S. census data and other information on the EIA website. He concluded about 12 million homes.

""I think their number is reasonable,"" Lantz said of Gayer’s estimate.

EIA spokesman Jonathan Cogan agreed. The federal agency estimated the nation was on pace to generate anywhere from 125 million to 140 million kilowatts of wind energy in 2012. The average American home uses about 11,000 kilowatts of energy a year, Cogan said.

""It seems to check out,"" Cogan told us.

We wondered, though, whether that meant 12 million or so homes in the U.S. were actually being powered through wind energy. Lantz said there is no data detailing the number of homes that actually use wind energy. Some of that energy could be powering commercial or other nonresidential facilities.

It’s not possible to say for sure how many homes actually use wind-generated electricity. But it is clear that there is enough produced to power millions of homes.

To sum up, Environment Georgia analyst Jennette Gayer said wind powers about 13 million homes across America.

"Says Austin’s treated wastewater, put into the Colorado River, is of higher quality than water the city takes from the lake for public use.","
Austin get its water from the Colorado River and puts its treated wastewater into the river, Mayor Lee Leffingwell reminded colleagues at a Dec. 13, 2012, Austin City Council meeting.

Yuck? ""Actually, it’s not as bad as it sounds,"" Leffingwell said, ""because it’s better quality than the water we take out of Lake Austin"" for public use. ""It’s treated to a high level.""

His comparison of upstream river water to what the Austin Water Utility pours in downstream came to our attention from a skeptical Bill Bunch, executive director of the Save Our Springs Alliance.

Data analyzed by the utility, the Lower Colorado River Authority and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality delivered a mixed picture, also demonstrating there are myriad ways to gauge water quality.

The utility treats lake water to drinking-water quality at two upstream plants and has two major downstream wastewater treatment plants, Walnut Creek and South Austin Regional. At the plants, screens and other devices help remove large objects and separate out significant amounts of sludge, the utility says, with the remaining wastewater passing through aeration basins where microorganisms convert pollutants into solids that get treated as sludge at the Hornsby Bend Biosolids Management Plant. The liquid that remains gets passed to chlorine basins for disinfection, the utility says, and more filtration. Ultimately, a small amount of sulfur dioxide is added to remove the chlorine before much of the treated water is put into the river.

By email, Leffingwell aide Amy Everhart advised us that the mayor drew on the utility’s assessment that water downstream of its wastewater plants is of higher quality than water upstream, ""meaning the discharge is of better quality than the water upriver,"" she said.

By email and in telephone interviews, utility officials pointed us to how the state rates the quality of sections of the river, which is broken into a chain of lakes by dams.

According to a chart starting on Page 80 of the Texas Surface Water Quality Standards, Lake Austin and Lady Bird Lake in the city are rated as ""high"" quality segments for aquatic life, a utility assistant director, Daryl Slusher, noted, while the section below Lady Bird Lake where Austin discharges most of its wastewater is rated more highly, as ""exceptional.""

""This is one of the very rare instances where the overall water quality in a river segment downstream of a major urban area is classified as better than that of the upstream segment,"" Slusher said.

Not so fast, an Austin environmental engineer said.

Lauren Ross, recommended to us by Bunch, pointed out by email that monitoring by the Lower Colorado River Authority indicates distinct nitrogen and phosphorus levels in the river. In August 2012, for instance, the level of nitrogen at the Lake Austin dam upstream was rated ""low,"" at 0.008 milligrams per liter, while the river below Austin was rated ""high/critical"" from Webberville to La Grange, with concentrations of 2.7 mg./liter to 6.4 mg./liter. Phosphorus levels tested ""normal"" at Lake Austin but were ""high/critical"" from Webberville to Smithville and ""high"" at La Grange, according to the authority.

By telephone, Raj Bhattarai, who manages the utility’s division of environmental and regulatory services, said it’s understandable that water downstream would have higher levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, given the Austin region’s population and that nitrogen and phosphorus are components of human waste byproducts.

Ross also suggested a look at differing levels of heavy metals upstream and downstream, which she said would indicate deterioration. The utility provided a chart showing average concentrations of 11 metals in Lake Austin and near the major treatment plants. Levels of arsenic, chromium, copper, lead, silver and zinc were the same or higher downstream. Levels of cadmium, nickel and mercury were the same, while levels of barium were lower downstream.

We weren’t sure what to make of these measurements. Ross said she wasn’t prepared to say there were health effects.

We asked the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for its analysis of differences between the water upstream and water returned to the river after wastewater treatment.

By email, spokeswoman Andrea Morrow responded that agency experts consider six indicators directly comparable between water checked by the commission every few months at monitoring stations on Lady Bird Lake and Lake Austin and wastewater effluent as gauged by the Austin utility at treatment plants including the Walnut Creek and South Austin Regional facilities.

According to a chart prepared by commission staff, both the water upstream and the effluent have similar, reasonable acidity/alkalinity and dissolved levels of oxygen. The utility’s effluent is of greater clarity, the chart suggests, and has lower E. coli levels, which can indicate fecal contamination and the potential for waterborne disease.

However, the effluent has higher levels of phosphorus (as measured at two smaller plants, Morrow said) and ammonia-nitrogen, the latter of which can be toxic to aquatic life in overly high concentrations, though it typically nourishes plants and algae, Morrow said.

Among six plants where effluent has been checked for ammonia-nitrogen, average levels ranged from 0.2 milligrams per liter to 0.9 milligrams per liter compared with permitted levels of 2 or 3 milligrams per liter, varying by location. Raw lake water, upstream, averaged 0.04 milligrams per liter for ammonia-nitrogen, the chart says.

Morrow wrote: ""These are only a fraction of water quality parameters that could potentially be compared between the two water types, but the reality is that available data allows only a handful to be evaluated."" By the indicators, she summarized, ""the effluent tends to be clearer and lower in bacteria levels, while the lake water"" before it is taken in by the utility ""is generally lower in nutrient concentrations. Dissolved oxygen and pH were comparable between the two types. So with respect to the statement that the effluent quality is higher than the source water, for some things it’s true, for others it’s not.""

Ross, speaking to the commission’s chart, said the utility does not check nitrogen levels of its effluent and ""failing to monitor for wastewater effluent’s most significant contributions to stream degradation hides the true impact of Austin’s wastewater effluent on downstream water quality.""

Bhattarai said the utility measures what’s required to be measured under its state-granted permit.

By email, Slusher said the utility doesn’t disagree with the commission analysis of individual elements in the wastewater effluent, though the big picture remains, he said, that the river downstream has judged of higher quality for aquatic life than Lake Austin.

In contrast, Ross said the levels of nitrogen and phosphorus downstream signal the effluent is not of higher quality, though she also said she’s not saying that the utility is not doing a good job.

We gathered more detail.

In the last three months of 2012, the utility said by email, the effluent from the major treatment plants had about nine times the level of ammonia that Lake Austin had in late 2010, the last time the utility checked in that stretch, and more than 850 times the amount of nitrogen that Lake Austin had in 2010.

Generally, Bhattarai said, the effluent can be of better quality than Lake Austin upstream, by certain parameters at certain times, but the utility doesn’t say that is always the case.

Our ruling

Leffingwell said Austin’s treated wastewater, put into the river, is of higher quality than water the city removes upstream for public use.

Some indicators suggest the river below Austin is of higher quality for aquatic life than the water in Lake Austin, but other measurements suggest higher downstream levels of nitrogen and phosphorus.

Besides, the mayor specified that the wastewater effluent is of higher quality than water in Lake Austin. The state’s analysis was that some elements of the effluent are better, some worse, with which the utility seemed to concur. 
This claim ultimately strikes us as oversimplifying a judgment that depends on which of many possible quality indicators is considered most significant",Half True,"January 21, 2013"
"Says in ""our region,"" 2011 was worst drought year ever recorded.","
Two state senators urged the Lower Colorado River Authority to dispense water carefully in an opinion piece in the Austin American-Statesman on Dec. 31, 2012.

""Our region is facing an emergency situation with the ongoing and ever-worsening drought: 2011 was the most severe year of drought ever recorded,"" wrote Sens. Kirk Watson and Troy Fraser.

Statewide, 2011 was a record year -- specifically ""the worst single-year drought on record,"" according to a March 23, 2012, Statesman news story.

In a Dec. 31, 2011, wrapup of the year’s biggest local news stories, Statesman editors put the drought at No. 2:
  
Crops wilted, lake levels dropped, lawns turned brown, and wildlife went thirsty as Texas endured record drought. At one point in October, 88 percent of the state was deemed to be in exceptional drought, the most severe level. Austin received just less than 15 inches of rain, about half of its normal precipitation, and sweated through a record 90 days of triple-digit temperatures."" 

So not all areas suffered to the same degree. Was the drought as harsh here as elsewhere?

First, we checked to make sure what region the senators meant. Watson spokesman Steve Scheibal told us by email that it would be fair to say they meant counties in the river authority's jurisdiction in and around the Austin area (Watson’s District 14 takes in Bastrop County and most of Travis County) and upriver in Fraser’s District 24.

We figured that’s probably about the impression Statesman readers got from the words ""our region,"" given that the context was senators discussing the river authority.

So we based our fact-finding on Travis, Williamson, Hays and Bastrop counties around Austin, plus Burnet, Blanco, Lampasas, Gillespie, Llano, San Saba and Brown counties upstream.

  
We looked at 11 counties. Click to view larger map 


Scheibal sent us links to 2011-12 newsletters and reports from the river authority and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality that described record-setting drought across Texas and dry months in the Lower Colorado river basin.

To get a closer look, we spoke via phone and email with state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon, an atmospheric science professor at Texas A&M University.

Drought, he told us, can be defined by factors including lack of rainfall, length of time and impact on people and crops.

Factoring in duration, for example, the most severe Texas drought remains the 1950-1957 drought, which an Aug. 14, 2011, Statesman news story said ""reshaped Texas, ruining thousands of farmers and ranchers and pushing rural residents to migrate out of the country and into the cities."" That was the worst extended drought since reliable state records began in the 1890s, though a 2011 study of Texas cypress tree rings showed several longer, harsher droughts over the past 500 years.

To help us judge the ""most severe year of drought"" in the 11-county region, Nielsen-Gammon checked rainfall data recorded there for each ""water year"" back to 1893.

Water years run from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30, he said, beginning with the period when most rainfall accumulates and ending after peak water use. The key is ""how much water you end up with at the end of the summer,"" he said.

In rainfall, Nielsen-Gammon told us, 2011 was the second-worst ""water year"" (Oct. 1 to Sept. 30) in those 11 counties since 1893.

The lowest rainfall came in 1956. But the drought was more severe in 2011, he said, because summer temperatures averaged 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit above those of 1956, ""increasing the need for water by plants while simultaneously evaporating water from reservoirs.""

So, according to Nielsen-Gammon, the 2011 water year was the worst 12-month drought ever recorded in the 11-county region. The 2011 calendar year would also have been the worst recorded, he said, measured by the river authority’s records of water flowing into the Highland Lakes: Buchanan, Inks, LBJ, Marble Falls, Travis and Austin, of which lakes Buchanan and Travis are reservoirs supplying water customers.

According to a Jan. 8, 2013, river authority report sent us by Scheibal, 2011 saw the lowest-ever recorded water flow (from creeks and other tributaries) into the Highland Lakes. We confirmed that with river authority spokeswoman Clara Tuma, who told us its records began in 1942, after the construction of Mansfield Dam created Lake Travis.

Nielsen-Gammon told us that although it would take ""some sort of major rain"" to get the river authority’s water levels back up to normal, the rainfall picture for 2012 was better overall, with precipitation near or above normal levels. Forecasts for 2013 are a still a toss-up, both he and Tuma said. The river authority posted an update Jan. 9, 2012, with data and an interactive map from the National Drought Mitigation Service showing the region still in ""Severe Drought.""

Our ruling

Watson said 2011 was the worst drought year in ""our region."" In records dating to 1893 for the general area indicated, 2011 was the most severe single-year drought by rainfall combined with evaporation, and it also saw the lowest recorded water-flow into the Highland Lakes",True,"January 15, 2013"
"There is ""over 20 times more energy"" in a proposed Southside uranium mining site than ""there is in all the oil that’s estimated to be off Virginia’s coast""","The General Assembly will consider a bill this winter that would end the state’s 31-year ban on uranium mining.

If approved, the state will begin drafting regulations that will allow Virginia Uranium Inc. to develop a mining and milling operation on a 3,000-acre site in Pittsylvania County. Opponents say the operation poses long-term threats to the environment and the sources of drinking water for many, including those in Virginia Beach, the state’s largest city.

Patrick Wales, project manager for Virginia Uranium, expressed confidence during a Dec. 6 symposium that the operation would be safe. He spoke enthusiastically about the project’s potential to provide jobs. And he said the abundance of uranium would produce a domestic energy source that far outstrips the oil reserves Virginia hopes to tap off its Atlantic coast.

There’s ""over 20 times more energy in this property than there is in all the oil that’s estimated to be off Virginia’s coast,"" Wales said.

That’s a big claim, so we decided to check Wales’ math.

Wales said the mining and milling would result in 119 million pounds of U308, or uranium oxide, which is the product his company will sell to electric utilities. The estimate comes from a 2008 study of the project that was commissioned by Virginia Uranium and conducted by Behre Dolbear Group Inc., Chicago, a mining engineering company..

No independent assessment of the uranium oxide yield exists. The 119 million pound estimate was cited and not questioned in a study of the risks of the mining enterprise conducted last year by the National Academy of Science.

As for oil reserves, Wales turned to estimates made by the Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy when a section off the coast of Virginia was considered for a lease sale in 2008 and 2009. It was estimated that 165 million barrels of oil could be pumped from the beds. President Barack Obama eventually canceled the lease sale.

The federal government, the governor and  Sen. Mark  Warner and Sen. Jim Webb used a slightly smaller figure in 2009 and 2010 -- 130 million barrels. Estimates of the oil resources are wide-ranging. As we reported in an earlier offshore drilling claim, the surveys of the seabed off the coast are 40 to 50 years old, so all estimates are speculative.

Let’s look at the conversion from uranium and oil to the common measure for energy, the British thermal unit or Btu.

A pound of uranium oxide contains the energy equivalent of 31 barrels of fuel oil, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency.

Under those conversions, the 119 million pounds of uranium oxide would produce as much energy as 3.7 billion barrels of oil. That dwarfs the 130 million to 165 million barrels expected to come from offshore drilling.

When we divide 3.7 billion by 165 million, we get 22.4 -- or the factor of how much more energy would come from the uranium than the estimated offshore oil.

Wales said his company has received a more recent, and higher, estimate of the project’s output from engineering firms Lyntek Inc., Lakewood, Colo., and BRS Engineering, Riverton, Wyo., at about 133 million pounds, but like the oil reserves, this wouldn’t greatly affect Wales’ statement.

Our ruling

Wales, in advocating the need and potential of a uranium mine in Southwest Virginia, called attention to its energy-production possibilities. He said the mine will yield enough uranium oxide to produce more than 20 times the power that would come from oil the state hopes to tap off Virginia’s shore.

The math works out for Wales with room to spare.  

We caution that the claim is dependent both on an estimate from the uranium project developer’s consultant and the wide-ranging, unproven estimates of oil off Virginia’s coast",True,"January 7, 2013"
"Says ""Detroit dumping a bunch of sewage"" in Lake Erie ""causes big problems"" for Ohio.","
John Kasich is no Michigan fan.

Ohio’s governor hinted as much when he spoke to reporters following an Ohio Farm Bureau speech on his administration’s new nutrient management plan to help the algae-infested Grand Lake Saint Marys.

After praising farmers for their role in helping to try to stem the problems from agricultural runoff at Grand Lake Saint Marys, the Republican governor (and graduate of The Ohio State University) turned to the state shaped like a mitten, saying he was upset that waste from Detroit fouls the waters of Lake Erie.

""We made great progress in Grand Saint Marys, and we are up in the Lake Erie watershed making sure we made great progress there,"" Kasich told reporters in Nov. 29 . ""We have a problem with Detroit dumping a bunch of sewage in the lake that causes big problems...""

But is the collective waste of Kid Rock and the other 700,000 Detroit residents being dumped into Lake Erie really ""a big problem"" as Kasich has stated? We strapped on our hip boots, and waded on in.

Great Lakes experts are quick to point out that Lake Erie is particularly susceptible to pollution from farms, factories and humans because it is both the most shallow and most fish-filled of the five major lakes that that straddle the United States border with Canada.

But amid the various contaminants, what emerges as the biggest threat to the health of the lake?

The foremost expert on Lake Erie’s water quality is David Baker, the director emeritus of the National Center for Water Quality Research at Heidelberg College in Tiffin, who has studied the waters of Lake Erie for nearly 40 years.

The biggest threat to the health of the lake has come from toxic blue green algae which has appeared in recent years — most noticeably in 2011— and can turn a thriving aquaculture into a marine dead zone, according to Baker.

""I would say that the blue green algae is the biggest problem that affects the Lake and the health of the water,"" Baker said. ""The bulk of the evidence—and the widespread scientific assessment — is that the dissolved phosphorus from agricultural runoff is the primary source of the problem.""

Agricultural runoff is funneled into Lake Erie when it washes away after fierce storms, and comes more from the Maumee River near Toledo than any other place, Baker said.

And while Detroit does have a massive — and somewhat antiquated — wastewater treatment plant serving 76 communities that dumps sewage into the Lake, Baker said the algae problems did not come from Michigan.

""We can look at pictures from satellite photos that show us this pretty clearly--we just don’t see big blooms of algae moving down the Detroit River,"" Baker said.

A particularly dry spring 2012 — just a year after the worst algae blooms on record in Lake Erie — further proved this point as the blue-green algae blooms were mostly absent with no agricultural runoff after storms to feed it, according to Baker.

""In a way, last year was a great experiment, and we got to see the Lake respond rather quickly to what the loading was from the agricultural watershed,"" Baker said. ""We just did not see the widespread blue green algae blooms problem in 2012.""

Baker said that problems with waste from Detroit being dumped into the Lake Erie were ""very minor"" because the phosphorus loads from wastewater remain relatively constant over time and are relatively diluted compared to the agricultural runoff that can funnel in after a storm. ""Things are always a little bit more complicated than what can be summarized by a governor,"" Baker said.

Largely agreeing with Baker was Kristy Meyer, director of Agricultural and Clean Water Programs for the Ohio Environmental Council. Meyer said agricultural runoff is the top issue for Lake Erie, not waste from Michigan, because it accounts for nearly half the phosphorus dumped into the Lake.

""It’s always nice to have a finger to point, and why not point the finger somewhere else?"" Meyer said. She did say that both are ""big problems"" in her view.

Backing the governor’s statement was Sandy Bihn, executive director of Lake Erie Waterkeeper Inc., a non-profit advocacy and education group focused on trying to improve Lake Erie’s water quality.

Bihn said she agreed with the governor’s characterization that Detroit sewage was a big problem noting that thousands of tons of sewage sludge were dumped into the Detroit and Rouge Rivers in recent years. ""What he said is a true statement,"" she said. ""When five percent of the phosphorous is coming from one place, that is something we need to be focused on.""

Problems with sewage being dumped into Lake Erie from Michigan grew worse in the last several years when equipment began to degrade and Detroit’s government couldn’t afford to fix or replace it, Bihn said. She credited the Kasich administration with pressing Michigan officials for action on the issue of the phosphorus flowing from the wastewater treatment plant in Detroit.

So where does that leave us?

As he was talking to reporters about improving water quality at Grand Lake St. Marys, Kasich praised farmers for doing more to limit agricultural runoff. Turning to Lake Erie, Kasich blamed Michigan for ""dumping sewage"" into the Lake that causes ""big problems.""

Kasich’s statement was partially accurate. Sewage from Detroit is being dumped into Lake Erie and it does certainly contribute to water quality problems in the Lake.

But there are important details needed to fully understand the claim.

Agricultural runoff is the biggest problem facing the shallowest of the Great Lakes as it causes toxic algae blooms, according to the foremost Lake Erie water quality expert. He called the impact of Detroit’s waste floating into the lake ""very minor."" Other Lake Erie water experts, though, seemed a bit more concerned about the impact of the Detroit waste in the overall mix.

But by praising farmers for limiting pollution being dumped into waterways and then blaming Michigan in the next breath for wastewater from Detroit funneling into the Lake, Kasich’s claim downplayed the impact of agricultural runoff in the lake. That impact is an important detail needed to put the governor’s claim in context",Half True,"January 7, 2013"
"""Hurricane Sandy, the most destructive Atlantic storm ever.""","Hurricane Sandy is probably the worst storm to hit New Jersey after it killed 40 people, remade parts of the Shore’s coastline and caused damages in the tens of billions of dollars.

But just how bad was it compared with other hurricanes?

""New Jersey can and must do more to slow global warming, especially after 2012's extreme weather and Hurricane Sandy, the most destructive Atlantic storm ever,"" Environment New Jersey said recently on its website.

The most destructive Atlantic storm? Ever? Considering the magnitude of some other hurricanes in history, PolitiFact New Jersey decided to investigate. Doug O’Malley, interim director for Environment New Jersey, said 'destructive' refers to the storm's financial damages. Data shows that while Sandy may be the worst storm to ever batter New Jersey and the tristate region, it’s not the most destructive Atlantic storm in history.

Let’s start with some background.

Sandy slammed New Jersey on Oct. 29, leveling houses along the Shore and inland, and leaving millions without power for extended periods. The storm also unleashed a similar fury on New York and Connecticut.
  
We checked Atlantic storms in the National Hurricane Center’s data archives, which tracks storm costs through 2010. Hurricane Irene, which hit New Jersey in 2011, is not included.

Leading the list is 2005’s Hurricane Katrina, at $108 billion. Even though Katrina was largely a Gulf Coast storm, doing the most damage in Louisiana and Mississippi, it formed in the Atlantic and made landfall near Florida’s Miami-Dade/Broward county line. It then moved across south Florida into the eastern Gulf of Mexico, according to Hurricane Center data.

""Katrina is still a clear runaway number one"" in terms of damages, said Dennis Eltgen, a spokesman at the Miami-based Hurricane Center.

Second on the list is 1992’s Hurricane Andrew, at $26.5 billion in damages. Andrew devastated parts of south Florida, continued into the Gulf of Mexico and turned north, hitting Louisiana.

Those rankings change when damages are adjusted for 2010 dollars.

In that case, the Great Miami Hurricane of 1926 that hit southeast Florida and Alabama ranks first, at $164.8 billion; Katrina second, at $113 billion; and Andrew fifth, at $58.5 billion.

Sandy, however, is different than many hurricanes that often swing through the Gulf of Mexico.

""I don’t think we were trying to claim that Sandy was more destructive than Katrina,"" O’Malley said. ""We were trying to say Sandy was the worst hurricane to fully hit the Eastern Seaboard. That being said, Katrina did obviously really hit New Orleans but clearly, it tailed over Florida. We were counting Katrina as only hitting the Gulf Coast. We trust the National Hurricane Center. If they say it’s both, we agree with that.""

The governors of New Jersey, New York and Connecticut have estimated Sandy’s damages at $82 billion. President Obama has requested $60 billion in federal aid for the three states. The Senate approved the request and the House passed a $9 billion aid package Friday, and additional aid is expected to pass on Jan. 15.

In making the aid request for the White House, Jeffrey D. Zients, deputy director for Management for the Office of Management and Budget, described Sandy’s place in hurricane history in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio).

""All told, although estimates of the total damage of Hurricane Sandy remain in flux, current projections are that Sandy is on track to be the second or third most costly natural disaster in U.S, history, behind Hurricane Katrina (2005) and close to Hurricane Andrew (1992),"" Zients wrote.

Our ruling

Environment New Jersey claimed that October’s Hurricane Sandy is ""the most destructive Atlantic storm, ever.""

Sandy may be the most destructive storm to hit a part of the Eastern Seaboard but in terms of most destructive Atlantic storms, that title goes to Katrina, which formed in the Atlantic and whose damages topped $100 billion, according to Hurricane Center data. Sandy, however, is very high on the list, with damages totaling at least  $82 billion.

"""In recent years, menhaden numbers along our coast have plummeted by 90 percent.""","The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission is scheduled to vote today, Dec. 14, on whether to cut the catch limit for Atlantic menhaden.

Environmentalists say the menhaden population, a crucial part of the Atlantic ecosystem, has dropped to dangerous levels. Menhaden are an important food source for tuna, cod, striped bass, whales, dolphins, ospreys and eagles.

Opponents of a strict limit, mostly from the fishing industry, say there are enough fish and the size of the population rises and falls naturally. The fish are used for fertilizer, bait, and fish-oil supplements.

On Dec. 11, three days before the meeting, the Pew Environment Group ran a large ad in The Providence Journal headlined, ""Governor Chafee: When this little fish disappears we're in big trouble."" It talked about the importance of the species, adding, ""But in recent years, menhaden numbers along our coast have plummeted by 90 percent.""

Fish counts are a contentious topic. After all, it's tough to do an inventory of undersea life, most of which you can't see. We wondered whether Pew’s number was accurate.

We asked Pew for its source. Spokesman Jeff Young referred us to the 2011 Stock Assessment Report by the fisheries commission, a compact of 15 states that deals with fishing issues on the East Coast.

Table 7.5 offers a complex calculation -- using lots of different data sources -- of the number of menhaden at the start of the year. The estimates go from 1955 to 2008. Young said biologists focus on the number of fish that had survived their first year, when they're more likely to be caught. We will do that as well.

The estimates over the years show two peaks and two valleys. The population was high in the 1950s. It dropped precipitously and remained low in the 1960s. Then it started rising significantly, peaking from 1976 to 1989 before falling back to the 1960-ish range during the last two decades.

Whether the population declined by 90 percent, as Pew asserts, depends on where you want to start calculating and when you want to stop.

The Pew ad says the 90-percent decline was ""in recent years."" It gives no time frame.

If you think of ""recent"" as the last 10 years, the drop from 1999 to 2008 has been 43 percent, far from 90 percent, according to the chart Pew referenced.

Over the last 20 years, it's been 76 percent.

To show a drop close to 90 percent, you have to start at 1982, when the estimated number of menhaden was 20.2 billion, the second-highest ever reported, and compare it with 2008, when the population was about 2.4 billion -- a drop of 88 percent.

If you started with the first year of data -- 8.3 billion fish in 1955 -- and compared it with 2008, you’d have a decline of 71 percent.

We found smaller percentages when we looked at the more recent commission report, from 2012, because it gives a higher number for the menhaden population for 2011, the most recent year the report looks at. Using that estimate, the decline since 1982 has been 82 percent.

But Pew Environment's chief scientist Jud Crawford said the most recent report is considered less reliable because questions have been raised about the way the estimates were calculated.

We also consulted with Mark Gibson, deputy chief of the marine fisheries division of the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management.

""There's no question there's been a decline downward,"" he said. ""But when you have a fish stock that varies up and down across time, you can cherry-pick your window across time, say it declined and get a whole bunch of people alarmed.""

Our ruling

The Pew Environment Group said that ""in recent years, menhaden numbers along our coasts have plummeted by 90 percent,"" a very specific number. It says overfishing must be halted to rebuild the population.

The estimated number of menhaden is clearly well below the estimated population for the late 1980s. But it's currently at levels seen in the 1960s.

If you want to claim a 90-percent drop, you have to compare the 2008 population to a very specific -- and very exceptional -- year, 1982.

"""We have more people working in clean and green energy than in oil and gas in this country.""","Supporters of environmentally compatible technology have been arguing of late that ""going green"" doesn’t only help preserve the environment, it adds to the nation’s employment rate.

One of them is U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, who, in an interview published in The Providence Journal Nov. 18, said, ""We have more people working in clean and green energy than in oil and gas in this country.""

To some, the green economy evokes images of people weaving rugs out of palm fronds, or growing their own vegetables. But an increasing number of studies are showing that developing environmentally sensitive products and services has become a growing and technologically sophisticated segment of the economy.

But more jobs than Big Oil? We decided to drill down and see if Whitehouse was right.

Whitehouse spokesman Seth Larson said the senator’s source was a July 2011 report, ""Sizing the Clean Economy,"" by the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, and the Battelle Technology Partnership Practice, a consulting firm that advises companies and governments on how to use new technologies to improve their operations.

The study sought to calculate how many companies in the United States are involved in so-called green industries, how many people they employ and how much of an impact the field has on the national economy.

In a summary of the report, Brookings said, ""the clean economy, which employs some 2.7 million workers, encompasses a significant number of jobs in establishments spread across a diverse group of industries. Though modest in size, the clean economy employs more workers than the fossil fuel industry …"" Brookings pegged the number of fossil fuel jobs at 2.4 million.

The report noted that the ""clean economy"" is an emerging concept that can mean different things to different people. The Brookings report said it focused on firms that either sold products or performed services that provided a definable environmental benefit, such as companies that clean up hazardous waste or manufacture solar panels.  

""No effort was made here to count companies that adopt internal environmental goals, reform their processes to make them more environmentally responsible or even contribute to general public knowledge about environmental issues,"" the report said.

""This study measures only employment in establishments that directly produce goods and services with environmental benefits.""

The survey began by taking an analysis from Dun & Bradstreet, which has developed a system to classify businesses on the basis of what they do or produce. Added to that database were similar lists developed the Pew Charitable Trust and the University of California at Berkeley.

Brookings researchers then examined other sources, such as industry association membership lists, patent applications, lists of companies receiving grants, to refine the roster.

It was a net that caught a wide swath of businesses, ranging from organic food farming to forestry, manufacturers of fuel cells and other types of energy conservation technology to mass transit, air and water purification to trash disposal to geothermal wind and solar power equipment manufacturers.

Add up the employees in those businesses, the Brookings report said, and you get 2.7 million.

In addition, a 2011 analysis by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics found that ""businesses that produce goods and services that benefit the environment or conserve natural resources"" accounted for 3.1 million jobs.

But what about the other number in the comparison -- the number of employees in the fossil-fuel industry.

Because that industry has been around for years, it has been widely studied and classified. Brookings got its 2.4 million number of oil industry jobs from a study by Moody’s Analytics, which counted jobs directly related to producing fossil-fuel based energy, and distributors and transporters, such as gas station employees.

Now, if you watch any television these days, you’ve no doubt seen a commercial from the American Petroleum Institute that boasts of 9.2 million American jobs that are supported by the U.S. oil industry. That’s nearly four times the Brookings’ claim.

But according to Petroleum Institute’s website, that includes not only people who work in the oil industry, but in industries that depend on petroleum to function. For example, because airlines need fuel to fly their jets, the Petroleum Institute counted pilots, flight attendants and ground crews as oil-related jobs.

Counting only jobs directly connected to producing and distributing oil and natural gas, the Petroleum Institute came up with 2.2 million jobs -- 200,000 fewer than the Brookings count.

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said more people in the United States work in green energy than in the petroleum industry.

"Says that Sherrod Brown is an ""Obama rubber stamp"" for ""supporting the job-killing cap and trade plan.""","U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown took considerable heat for his position on cap-and-trade legislation.

He voted against it in the Senate, which disappointed and even outraged some environmentalists. It was among the biggest issues on which Brown, Ohio's Democratic incumbent, split with President Barack Obama.

That was why PolitiFact Ohio was surprised to hear a radio ad for Brown's Republican challenger, Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel.

The ad blasts Brown for ""supporting the job-killing cap-and-trade plan"" and labels him an  ""Obama rubber stamp.""

We asked the Mandel campaign how that claim was supported, and we reviewed the background.

Cap and trade legislation seeks to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and other greenhouse gas sources by setting caps on the amount of pollutants a plant can spew into the air. Companies that come in below their cap are then allowed to sell their emission credits to other companies that need them. Supporters say the approach provides economic incentives to reduce pollution and innovate. Critics deride it as an energy tax and say it increases costs for everyone.

The approach was originally employed to curb the pollutants that cause acid rain in the early 1990s. President George H.W. Bush championed it, with the support of both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. In 2008, it was one of the few areas of common ground between Obama and his opponent, Sen. John McCain. Both acknowledged climate change and favored carbon caps.

In June 2008, Brown joined Republicans in voting to block a bill which would have imposed a cap-and-trade system of credits for carbon dioxide emissions.

He said he would have liked to support the bill, but he said the measure would place too high a cost on Ohio industry and threatened jobs.

In spring 2009, after Obama had taken office, Brown proposed legislation to provide incentives for manufacturers to adopt green technologies, but said it ""doesn't cause me at all to change any position from last year"" opposing a cap-and-trade system.

He voted shortly afterward to keep the fast-track budget reconciliation process open on an emissions bill, so that it would not face a filibuster, but said he still had significant concerns about the legislation.

""I'm an environmentalist,"" he said. ""I want cap and trade. I just want to make sure that the ratepayers in my state don't get socked hard. And that the manufacturing doesn't get crippled.""
Mandel's campaign cited that quote as a source for its assertion that ""Brown was open to supporting a cap-and-trade proposal.""

But being open to support falls short of endorsement.
Before cap-and-trade legislation stalled and then died in the Senate, the New York Times reported in October 2009 that ""Brown has not been shy about embracing the cap-and-trade policy (but) he also has not endorsed the bill.""

Brown ""has bluntly stated that unless the (carbon emissions bill's) authors agree to a variety of manufacturing and trade provisions, there is little possibility that the legislation will get anywhere near enough support to clear the Senate,"" the article said.

""Clean energy legislation is not just about the environment, it's about creating jobs and revitalizing our nation's manufacturing basis,"" Brown said. ""For a clean energy bill to be successful, it must also be a jobs bill that partners with the business community.""

In early 2011, with no legislation on the table, The Plain Dealer reported that Brown and the coal industry ""both are trying in their own ways to stop President Barack Obama's administration from imposing rules this year on new or upgraded power plants and large factories that use coal because, both say, the rules would hurt Ohio manufacturers and consumers.""

What's the capper on the ad's claim?

The Mandel ad labeled Brown ""an Obama rubberstamp"" for ""supporting the job-killing cap and trade plan.""

We’ll leave the phrase ""job-killing"" to those who debate policy. As a statement of opinion, PolitiFact Ohio won’t rate it.

Regardless, the statement is not accurate. Rather, it invokes the fear of a proposed system for limiting emissions that Congress could never agree on and to this day does not exist.

Brown has expressed support for some form of emissions controls and has said that under the right conditions, he would support cap-and-trade legislation. But it’s also clear that he had reservations about the legislation that has been before the Senate.

When the 2009 bill was pending, Brown never endorsed it. He ""bluntly stated that unless the (carbon emissions bill's) authors agree to a variety of manufacturing and trade provisions, there is little possibility that the legislation will get anywhere near enough support to clear the Senate,"" according to The New York Times. That bill stalled in the Senate and died without a final vote.

In 2008, prior to Obama becoming president, Brown joined Republicans and voted to block a bill that would have created a cap-and-trade system of credits for carbon dioxide emissions.

That is far from being a rubber stamp on the issue",False,"November 1, 2012"
"""There is no war on coal. Period. There are more coal jobs and more coal produced in Ohio than there were five years ago, in spite of the talking points and the yard signs.""","
There is a war on coal, Republicans are telling the public.

The story line took center stage during a mid-August campaign stop for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in Belmont County. With coal miners standing behind him, Romney attacked the Obama administration saying the Democratic president was developing alternative energy at the expense of the coal industry and heavy-handed in regulating the energy resource.

Charges that Democrats have hurt the coal industry have spread to Ohio Senate's race, too. During a U.S. Senate debate held by the City Club of Cleveland on Oct. 16, a questioner asked incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown how he could support jobs and cheaper energy in Ohio while backing a president that has declared war on coal.

Brown fired back saying the ""war on coal"" rhetoric is empty.

""There is no war on coal. Period. There are more coal jobs and more coal produced in Ohio than there were five years ago, in spite of the talking points and the yard signs,"" he told the audience.

Has coal production and the number of coal mining jobs in Ohio really gone up during the time Obama has been in office? PoltiFact Ohio got out the pickaxes and started digging for facts.

First, we turned to Brown's campaign to find out the source of Brown's information.

Brown campaign spokesman Justin Barasky sent us some information from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources annual coal reports showing that production in 2010 was 28,364,000 tons compared to 22,283,072 tons in 2007. Those same ODNR-produced reports show the monthly employment average for coal mining jobs in Ohio in 2010 was 2,879, compared to a monthly average of 2,204 in 2007.

With the 2011 state coal report due out any day, ODNR spokeswoman Heidi Hetzel-Evans was able to tell us that the 2011 report will show that Ohio produced about 27,929,089 tons of coal--a slight drop from the 2010 data that Brown was basing his comment on. Coal mining jobs in Ohio in 2011 were up over the previous year with an average of 2,995 a month, and obviously, both are well ahead of 2007 figures.

PolitiFact Ohio also checked with the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which provided a second source of data with even more recent numbers. The EIA estimates coal production for every state on a weekly basis and the October 13 report showed Ohio coal production so far this year up about 1.9 percent over last year.

For the most recent 12 months, from October 13, 2011, to October 13, 2012, Ohio has produced about 28,456,000 tons of coal. That matches up fairly closely with the ODNR reports and certainly shows that there hasn't been any fall off in coal production in Ohio in recent months.

We also looked for a second source on the coal mining jobs numbers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics keeps a Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages which tracks job numbers in specific industries. For Ohio, the census data showed an average of 2,570 coal mining jobs statewide in 2011.

That's almost 30 percent higher than 2007 when the bureau showed only 2,010 coal mining jobs in Ohio. Counted in those statistics are jobs related to the actual mining of coal as well as developing coal mining sites and preparing the coal such as cleaning and screening the coal to be sold.

So why has production of Ohio's high-sulfur coal increased in the last few years?

Coal industry analysts generally attribute the jump in coal production to an increase in exports to overseas markets such as China and India, which need coal for cheap energy and to use  in the steel-making process.

So after mining for facts what are we left with?

In defending the Democratic record on coal during a debate, Sherrod Brown said coal production and coal jobs in Ohio are up compared to five years ago. After consulting with state and federal statistics, it appears that jobs and coal production in Ohio have increased compared to 2007 levels by every measurement we could find",True,"October 31, 2012"
"""There are more oil rigs in operation in the United States than the rest of the world combined.""","
Are we doing enough to produce energy in the United States? That was one of the issues on the table when U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat, and former state police Col. Brendan Doherty, a Republican, squared off in a WPRI - Providence Journal debate Oct. 16.

Doherty talked about a bill he supports that would raise revenue for infrastructure by allowing more oil and gas drilling on federally-owned lands.

Cicilline called it ""a big, big giveaway to big oil . . . when we already know, according to the best available data as of February of this year, there are more oil rigs in operation in the United States than the rest of the world combined.""

More oil rigs in operation than everyone else in the world? That's quite a statistic. We wondered if it is true.

This is a talking point that has been used in the past by the Obama administration. In fact, when we asked the Cicilline campaign for the source of the factoid, they sent us to a blog entry at the White House website that stated it without giving a source or offering any numbers.

PolitiFact Florida looked at the claim (and a related claim) this winter, when President Obama offered it in February during speeches in Miami and earlier in New Hampshire.

They found that the answer wasn't quite so simple.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration recommended that PolitiFact get the latest count from Baker Hughes, an oilfield services company.

We checked the numbers from two weeks ago. (For even more recent numbers, go here.)

As of Oct. 12, 2012, the company had tallied 1,835 oil and gas drilling rigs in the United States and 1,615 in other countries. (That U.S. number is 188 lower than the 2011 total. The international number is 71 rigs higher.)

However, the Baker Hughes data do not include rigs drilling in Russia or onshore China because those statistics are difficult to get.

Richard Mason, who works for the publication Hart Energy Digital, told PolitiFact in February that ""the last numbers I saw out of Russia, which are 18 months old, had more than 1,000 rigs active.""

Kurt Abraham, executive editor of World Oil, another energy publication, cited a report from a Chinese state-owned company that manufactures rigs and rig equipment that showed more than 1,000 land rigs.

As Cicilline’s statement stood, only 221 more international rigs were need to make it False. And the Baker Hughes count is probably missing the approximately 2,000 rigs in Russia and China. And all that was applicable in February.

Our ruling

David Cicilline said, ""There are more oil rigs in operation in the United States than the rest of the world combined."" He said that information comes from ""the best available data"" in February.

He's relying on a count that excludes some of the largest producers of oil and gas in the world, calling that the ""best available data.""

It's not.

The best available data would take into account reliable evidence that two thousand rigs are in operation in China and Russia, a number that would allow the world total to overwhelm the U.S. total.

Just because you haven't counted something, doesn't mean it's not there",False,"October 22, 2012"
"""Under the Obama administration, we are drilling and producing more domestic energy supplies than we ever had before.""","
The concern that the United States is not producing enough energy, resulting in high fuel prices, has been one of the themes of the 2012 election season. It came up during the Oct. 9, 2012, Eyewitness News debate between Democratic U.S. Rep. James Langevin and Republican challenger Michael Riley.

Langevin, asked about energy, said the United States should tap whatever natural resources it can, but added, ""The reality is that the United States doesn't have enough of the world's energy supplies to make a real appreciable difference in controlling or bringing down our energy costs.

""Under the Obama administration we are drilling and producing more domestic energy supplies than we ever had before and it really hasn't had much of an impact on bringing down energy prices,"" he said.

We hadn't heard that the United States is producing more energy than ever before. We decided to see if it was true.

We asked the Langevin campaign for the source of the candidate's claim.

His communications director, Jonathon Dworkin, responded by e-mail that, ""The Congressman misspoke when he said 'ever,' as he realized after the debate.""

""His point was that during the Obama administration, domestic drilling had increased significantly from the years before he took office, going back either 8 or 25 years depending on what you want to measure,"" said Dworkin.

He sent us a statement from the U.S. Department of the Interior asserting that domestic oil production is at an eight-year high and an Aug. 27, 2011, chart from The Wall Street Journal showing that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States had risen to 1,069, the highest level since at least 1987, according to data from the oil services company  Baker Hughes Inc.

We also looked at some of the statistics from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and found that the United States has a long way to go before producing more oil than it ever has.

U.S. production of crude oil peaked at nearly 3.52 billion barrels in 1970. In 2011, production was 2.07 billion barrels. That's about 41 percent below the peak. Production bottomed out at 1.83 billion barrels in 2008 -- the last year of the George W. Bush administration -- and has subsequently risen 13 percent. July production was 194 million barrels; aside from last March, that's the highest since May 1998.

(Many people assume that when you produce more oil, it lowers prices at the gasoline pump. But the Associated Press compared EIA data on domestic oil production with gasoline prices over the past 36 years and found that there was no link.)

But although Langevin's spokesman sent us information about oil prices, Langevin's debate statement was more general, encompassing all energy supplies.

We found that if you look at all fossil fuels, not just crude oil, part of Langevin's statement was correct.

The United States produced 60.1 quadrillion British thermal units of fossil fuel energy in 2011, more than any year in the EIA database going back to 1949, according to the agency's latest data, which is preliminary. (Using the BTU scale allows a comparison between different types of energy.)

Fossil fuel production is higher than ever before because coal production has been rising steadily (except for the past few years) and natural gas production has increased dramatically, in part because companies are using the controversial technique of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, to pull more gas from the ground.

However, Langevin's statement saying that this happened ""under the Obama administration"" suggests that the administration was responsible for this trend.

As we have stressed in the past, market forces play the biggest role in determining energy production. In this case, high prices for fossil fuels have encouraged production.

Our Ruling

U.S. Rep. James Langevin, during a discussion that touched on energy policy, said, ""Under the Obama administration, we are drilling and producing more domestic energy supplies than we ever had before.""

Crude oil production in the United States has, in fact, risen recently after a 38-year decline but it is far from its historic high.

However, overall fossil fuel production is the highest it’s ever been, thanks mostly to a sharp increase in natural gas production since 2005.

Langevin may have thought he misspoke, but he actually had the larger trend right.

What he got wrong was the suggestion that the Obama administration was responsible when, in fact, the role of any administration in such matters is usually limited",Half True,"October 16, 2012"
"""In one year, (President Obama) provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world … into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1.""","
In the battle of big numbers at the first presidential debate, Mitt Romney used one five times to attack President Barack Obama’s energy policy: $90 billion.

That was the price tag of ""breaks to the green energy world"" Obama provided ""in one year,"" Romney said.

Later, he elaborated the president had put that money ""into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1.""

So, tens of billions funneled from the Obama administration to troubled companies for alternative energy — in one year. Really?

We asked the Romney campaign about that $90 billion.

Five times

The number appears in a 2010 report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers on the American Recovery And Reinvestment Act, better known as the stimulus bill.

According to the report, $90 billion is the amount of money in the Obama law for ""clean energy investments.""

Here’s how Romney used the number in the debate.

Obama had attacked $4 billion a year in ""corporate welfare"" for the oil industry.  

(His proposed 2013 budget called for removing a handful of ""tax provisions that preferentially benefit fossil fuel production."" PolitiFact Ohio reported that the nonpartisan taxpayer watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense estimates the U.S. tax code currently contains about $5 billion in yearly tax breaks that are exclusive to the oil and gas industry.)

Romney fired back: 

So, Romney contrasted a ""tax break"" of a few billion for oil companies with ""breaks"" worth tens of billions for ""green energy."" Later in the debate, he got more specific: 
Finally, Romney drove home the number, repeating it three more times, and linking it to companies who have ""gone out of business."" 
It’s fair to say that listeners may have gotten the impression that Obama gave $90 billion in tax breaks in a single year to companies for alternative energy like solar and wind, many of which didn’t fare well.

 ‘One year’ of ‘breaks’

Back to that report about stimulus spending on clean energy.

Were there $90 billion in ""breaks""? Perhaps in a generic sense, as in — some folks caught a break by taking advantage of government spending. But not so much if Romney meant ""tax breaks"" like those for oil and gas.

Rather, the money was distributed in six different ways: private and public matching grants, tax credits, loan guarantees, direct loans and interest subsidies. Tax benefits were part of the package, but so were very different kinds of spending.

""The vast majority of the $90 billion for green energy weren't tax breaks,"" said Michael Grabell, a reporter for Pulitzer-winning site ProPublica who published a book this year on stimulus spending, Money Well Spent?

Meanwhile, the money would have been distributed over longer than one year, depending on the program. Some money — such as for high-speed rail — states still have a few years to spend, Grabell said. Weatherization projects, among the quicker programs, took two or three years. The loan guarantee program through the Department of Energy, which benefitted troubled solar panel maker Solyndra, focused on projects through September 2011.

So, Romney is off in two respects. They are not just tax breaks and they are not just for one year.

 ‘Solar and wind ... Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1’

We’ll assume Romney meant ""solar and wind"" and ""Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1,"" as merely examples of Obama’s $90 billion in green energy spending in the stimulus.

But even as examples, they’re problematic. ""Solar and wind"" investments represented comparatively small parts of the $90 billion.

Solar-panel manufacturer Solyndra and electric-battery maker Ener1, which got stimulus-backed help, qualified for less than $700 million in grants and loan guarantees, and didn’t use it all.

Fisker and Tesla — troubled electric-car companies that got loan guarantees funded with money appropriated under President George W.Bush — had nothing at all to do with the $90 billion.

So, just what did make up the $90 billion?

The Council of Economic Advisers report cited by the Romney campaign breaks the spending into eight categories. Here’s the majority of it:
  

That’s more than 60 percent of the $90 billion Romney’s campaign said he was talking about. Much of it funneled through state and local governments to contractors for specific projects, rather than as breaks directly for companies.

Less than 40 percent of the $90 billion included was for things such as the installation of wind turbines and solar panels, supporting American manufacturing of advanced batteries and other advanced vehicle technology, research and development of clean coal technology and a few billion in tax credits for alternative energy.

Those investments are more in line with Romney’s characterization. But they represent less than half the ""$90 billion"" he repeatedly mentioned.

Why does it matter if Romney mischaracterized how the money was used, as long as it went to clean energy? He draws a conclusion about winners and losers, and says, ""and these businesses, many of them have gone out of business.""

It’s a claim that our colleagues at FactCheck.org addressed this week, pointing out that might be true of companies that got loan guarantees in a single year — a sliver of a sliver of the money that Romney’s talking about. But less than 12 percent of the 26 companies that ultimately benefited from the program filed for bankruptcy, FactCheck.org reported.

And the entire loan guarantee program represented just a few billion of the $90 billion investment outlined by the Council of Economic Advisors.

""A very small percentage of all the companies that benefited from the $90 billion in green job spending have gone out of business,"" said Grabell, the author of Money Well Spent? ""Not half of them. Not even half of the loan guarantees. ""

 Our ruling

Romney used the number ""$90 billion"" five times in the first presidential debate, claiming, ""In one year, (Obama) provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world … into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1.""

That is incorrect in several ways. That $90 billion, as described in a report provided by the Romney campaign, wasn’t provided in one year, wasn’t distributed primarily via tax breaks, wasn’t primarily provided directly to companies, wasn’t primarily spent on solar and wind, and wasn’t spent at all on Fisker or Tesla.

In reality, more than 60 percent of it was directed to state and local governments and utility companies for energy efficiency, transportation and electrical infrastructure ",False,"October 5, 2012"
"""We have more natural gas than Saudi Arabia has oil.""","
After speaking to the Milwaukee Rotary Club on Sept. 11, 2012, Wisconsin U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson took questions from the audience.

Asked about achieving energy independence, the former Republican governor called for several initiatives, including converting semitrailer trucks and buses so that they can burn compressed natural gas rather than diesel fuel.

After all, Thompson reasoned:

""We have more natural gas, ladies and gentlemen, than Saudi Arabia has oil.""

We do?

It turns out another GOP politician recently preceded Thompson down this road. Let’s see where it’s led them.

Jon Huntsman, the former presidential candidate and Utah governor, also referred to new sources of energy when making the same claim Thompson did during a GOP presidential debate in December 2011. PolitiFact National rated his statement Mostly False, given that it is off based on two of three ways to measure the question.

1. In terms of proved resources -- those likely to be developed under current economic and operating conditions -- Saudi Arabia’s oil reserves are far larger than U.S. natural gas reserves.

2. Saudi Arabia also comes out ahead when considering technically recoverable resources -- those that could be developed using current exploration and production technology, without regard to cost.

3. The U.S. leads Saudi Arabia only when comparing current production levels -- the U.S. produces more natural gas every year than Saudi Arabia produces oil.

Even at that, reserves are more relevant than current production in terms of moving America toward energy independence.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration provided the statistics used by PolitiFact National. We checked back with the agency, which confirmed that each of the three statistics remains true.

Back to Thompson.

Thompson campaign spokeswoman Lisa Boothe said Thompson ""clearly meant to say was that we produce more natural gas in this country every year than Saudi Arabia produces oil.""

We don’t think it is so clear, given that Thompson made no mention of production.

"Says Sierra Club sued him to stop oil and gas activity on Texas coast, but ""we won"" and ""the turtles are fine.""","
Sea turtles surfaced at the state Republican convention in Fort Worth -- in a speech.

State Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson said June 9, 2012: ""I have been sued by the Sierra Club. Sued me. They wanted to stop oil and gas exploration, production, on the Texas Gulf Coast,"" he said. ""We won. We’re producing oil and gas, and the turtles are fine.""

We decided to check on the oil and gas and turtles.

Patterson told us by phone that he was referring to a 2002 lawsuit brought by the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club over drilling at the Padre Island National Seashore, the federal park southeast of Corpus Christi on North Padre Island that is a nesting ground for sea turtles including the endangered Kemp’s ridley.

We looked up the case on the U.S. District Court website for the Southern District of Texas, where records show the suit was filed April 18, 2002, and dismissed May 7, 2003. The Sierra Club took the decision to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which dismissed the appeal Aug. 27, 2003.

The club sued the U.S. secretary of the interior, National Park Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, saying they had not done enough wildlife impact analysis to comply with federal laws before giving BNP Petroleum of Corpus Christi permission to drill in the park.

When the area became a federal park in 1962, the original private landowners and the state retained the rights to extract and profit from minerals at the site. According to the park’s website, drilling has occurred there since the 1950s. The state’s share of royalties from oil and gas goes into the Texas Permanent School Fund, an endowment established in 1876 to channel income from state lands to Texas public schools.

The Sierra Club lawsuit sought an injunction to halt drilling permits until the defendants complied with the federal laws the club claimed were broken. The district court, however, found that the government had sufficiently investigated the impact of drilling and operation on the turtles, and the appeals court affirmed that decision.

So, was Patterson sued, as he says?

We realized he could not have been one of the parties originally sued in 2002 -- he wasn’t even elected land commissioner until November 2002. Rather, court records and our phone interview with Patterson spokesman Jim Suydam showed that in his role as land commissioner, Patterson filed to intervene in the suit Jan. 14, 2003. After that, according to the court documents and an April 19, 2003, Associated Press news story, Patterson was listed as a defendant in the suit.

According to the appeals court summary, the district court said government had not shirked its duties in estimating the effect drilling would have on the turtles, noting that the Park Service’s March 2001 oil and gas management plan spelled out restrictions and mitigation requirements. The plan’s 16 pages of drilling/production requirements include measures such as having turtle-spotting monitors precede heavy equipment being driven along the beach and shielding light sources so turtles would not become disoriented.

The courts’ dismissals of both the lawsuit and the club’s appeal amounted to victory for the government, or as Patterson said, ""We won.""

And how about those turtles?

Texas’ coast once had many.

According to a news story in the June 2012 issue of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department’s magazine, canneries nearly wiped out the Texas green turtle population after the Civil War. The department’s website said the turtles were hit hard again from the 1940s to 1960s by people gathering and selling ""truckloads"" of eggs. Today, the story said, the shrimping industry is the biggest threat. Sea turtles must surface to breathe; if they’re trapped below water in a net, they will drown.

""All species in Texas waters — leatherback, hawksbill, loggerhead, green and Kemp’s ridley — are listed as either threatened or endangered,"" the story said. The Parks and Wildlife website said Kemp’s ridleys are the most endangered sea turtle species in the world.

In a U.S.-Mexico program from 1978-88, Kemp’s ridley eggs from a turtle sanctuary in Tamaulipas were brought to Padre to hatch, ""imprinting"" the baby turtles to return there for nesting, according to the story, which also said, ""All along the Texas coast, scientists and advocates have dedicated their careers to sea turtle research and protection.""

According to news stories dating from 2002 through August 2012 that we found using the Nexis news database, since 1996, turtle nest counts on the Texas coast have risen almost every year. Texas’ growing colony of Kemp’s ridleys now serves as a backup of sorts -- if disaster struck the Tamaulipas sanctuary, the species might not be wiped out.

Carole Allen, Gulf office director with the nonprofit Sea Turtle Restoration Project, told us by email that she believes the major reasons for rising turtle numbers are increased protection of the turtles in Tamaulipas and the requirement of turtle excluder devices on U.S. shrimp boats. The devices, called TEDs, provide a grill of bars in a trawl net that large sea creatures can fit through; shrimpers, however, sometimes sew nets together again to counteract that escape hatch.

In its 2002 lawsuit, the Sierra Club described ways that oil and gas operations could harm turtles, but included no measurement of harm occurring. We checked with the club’s lead volunteer in the lawsuit, Pat Suter, who chairs the Corpus Christi chapter. She told us by phone, ""As far as I know, there has not been direct impact on the turtles that can be proved.""

Sierra said in its suit that trucks traveling to and from the well site would threaten turtles. The news articles we reviewed included no reports of turtles hurt or discouraged from nesting by oil and gas rigs, trucks, drilling or pumping at the federal park. Separately, an April 15, 2004, ""white paper"" on the park’s website said, ""There has been vehicle traffic, from both visitors and heavy equipment operators, on the Gulf of Mexico shoreline for over fifty years with no documented case of a crushing of a nesting sea turtle within the park.""

Allen told us, ""My personal opinion is that everything is being done to protect nesting sea turtles and hatchlings from being run over at the National Seashore. Kemp's ridleys are in far more danger from law-breaking shrimpers.""

As we closed out this check, Suydam conceded that Patterson was not sued by the Sierra Club.

""It looks like Commissioner Patterson misspoke there,"" Suydam said. ""He intervened in the Sierra Club's lawsuit, and then became a defendant."" Still, Suydam said, ""The sentiment is true. When the Sierra Club sues to stop oil and gas exploration, it is in effect suing to limit oil and gas production on Permanent School Fund lands,"" which is Patterson’s responsibility.

Our ruling

The Sierra Club did not sue Patterson; he wasn’t quite land commissioner when the group filed its suit against federal agencies.

Still, he later joined the lawsuit, which the government won. And, despite ongoing oil and gas activity at the park in accord with the 1962 terms, Texas’ threatened and endangered sea turtles are increasing in numbers",Half True,"September 12, 2012"

""After 30 years of inaction, we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade, cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas,"" he told delegates to the Democratic National Convention on Sept. 6, 2012.

We rated Obama’s original presidential campaign pledge to raise fuel economy standards a Promise Kept.

But we wondered, was it true that ""after 30 years of inaction,"" fuel standards will double for cars and trucks by 2025?

That might be news to President George W. Bush.

 What Obama did

In August 2011, the Obama administration issued new federal fuel economy rules that set an average fuel efficiency goal of 54.5 miles per gallon for the 2025 model year.

That’s nearly twice the 27.6 miles per gallon standard for 2011, for cars and for trucks.

So far, so good.

But we paused at Obama’s claim that his administration took action ""after 30 years of inaction.""

Mileage standards in the United States have been in place since the 1970s Arab oil embargo.

Back then, Congress passed the Energy Policy Conservation Act of 1975, which boosted the fuel economy of cars and light trucks. ""Corporate average fuel economy,"" or CAFE, standards reached 27.5 miles per gallon in 1985 — then hovered there.

Obama’s speech might have left you thinking nothing else happened until his administration took charge.

But in 2007, Bush signed the Energy Independence and Securities Act, which required ""substantial, continuing increases in fuel economy standards,"" according to a helpful history lesson at auto information site Edmunds.com.

Bush noted at his signing ceremony that the law marked the first statutory increase in fuel economy standards since they were enacted — something he had asked for.

Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., then speaker of the House, remarked on the historic nature of the bipartisan legislation, writing that its auto efficiency reforms were ""the first in more than 30 years.""

And that law laid the groundwork for Obama’s rule changes.

Bush’s administration left for Obama’s the job of finalizing standards, something it hadn’t yet done ""because of the uncertainty gripping car companies,"" Reuters reported.

""A lot of what Obama's doing is really extending what President Bush started,"" Jeremy Anwyl, vice chairman for Edmunds.com, told PolitiFact in January.

That’s not what Obama’s sweeping oversimplification suggested.

The president also said that ""by the middle of the next decade, cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas."" That’s what the new rules require. Edmunds.com reports that ""regulators, environmentalists and most automakers agree that existing technologies can be used to achieve this plan's goals."" There’s just debate about their cost. While automakers have so far met boosted standards by updating traditional engines, Anwyl says those relatively inexpensive gains won't carry companies through lofty goals set for 2025.

Still, 13 automakers in August announced support for the new standards, signaling they believe they’ll be able to achieve the gains.

 Our ruling

Obama said, ""After 30 years of inaction, we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade, cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas."" The Obama administration launched new fuel efficiency standards that significantly raise the bar for automakers over the next decade.

But the rules, which raise standards from their 1985 levels, grew from a bipartisan law requested and signed by Bush. We’ll give Obama credit for pushing for a long-term agreement with aggressive goals and working with automakers who say they’ll get it done. But he’s on shakier ground when he gives the impression his administration was solely responsible",Half True,"September 10, 2012"
Claims Ohio Gov. John Kasich says climate change is a problem.,"Republican devotees who have traveled to Tampa, Fla. for their party’s national convention expect a week filled with activities aimed at unifying the GOP around the central policy and agenda messages as they nominate former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney for president.

But as thousands of out-of-towners arrived and made their trek to the Tampa Bay Times Forum, the arena hosting the convention, they have been greeted by some well-placed advertisements featuring some prominent conservative leaders -- including Ohio Gov. John Kasich -- that are not quite in lock-step with the message Republicans have long touted.

Kasich is prominently featured on a billboard outside the arena and on one at the most central interstate highway crossing in the city, as well as, on some placards adorning 40 city taxi cabs proclaiming his belief that global warming is real.

""I am a believer – my goodness I am a Republican – I happen to believe there is a problem with climate change,"" reads a quote attributed to Kasich that appears next to a picture of the smiling Ohio governor.

But wait, Kasich is still as staunch a conservative as ever, isn’t he? PolitiFact Ohio decided to check if the ad accurately reflects the governor’s position.

The billboard was sponsored by the Florida Wildlife Federation, a private membership group with about 60,000 members who are hunters, fishermen and outdoorsmen with a keen interest in environmental issues. It told PolitiFact Ohio it partnered with the Evangelical Environmental Network, a Washington lobbying group, to place the advertisements.

The Federation’s policy consultant, Jay Liles, said his group is desperate to get politicians to view climate change as a life-changing issue and not a partisan issue. They have skin in this game. And there it is true that some Republicans have staked out a position doubting that climate change is really a factor.

In addition to Kasich, the federation also has sponsored similar ads with similar messages from similarly conservative leaders, such as, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former President George W. Bush.

We checked with Kasich’s staff to see whether the quote was accurate. Rob Nichols, the governor’s spokesman, confirmed that it was taken from a speech Kasich made in May 2012 at a small energy conference in Columbus, Ohio, that was sponsored by The Hill, a Capitol Hill media organization.

""What they have on the billboard is accurate,"" Nichols said, adding that Kasich has uttered similar comments four or five times during various private speeches, some of which were before Republican gatherings.
 
But for context, Nichols said there is a little more to Kasich thoughts on global warming.
 
""He has said this several times but what is usually omitted is what is on the back-end of what he has said,"" Nichols said. ""Each time he says it he has added, ‘How big is this? I don’t know. Should we overreact to this? No.’""
 
In fact, The Hill published an article on May 2, 2012, about Kasich’s speech at the energy conference. The quote on the billboard came from that story, according to the Evangelical Environmental Network.
 
The full quote is: ""I am a believer – my goodness I am a Republican – I happen to believe there is a problem with climate change. I don’t want to overreact to it, I can’t measure it all, but I respect the creation that the Lord has given us and I want to make sure we protect it.""
 
Liles said the Federation was approached by the evangelical group and agreed to sponsor the Tampa advertisements to convince Republicans to stop viewing global warming through political lenses.
 
""We believe at the core that people don’t treat our environment as a right or left issue, it is an issue that affects all of us. It is an issue that affects our pocketbooks,"" Liles said.
 
""Whether it is addressed more through market driven means or through proposed regulatory means,"" he said, ""we believe somewhere in the middle is a road forward and they need to stop making this a partisan issue.""
 
Alexei Laushkin, of the Evangelical Environmental Network, which paid for the advertisements said his group intentionally sought out key conservative leaders to push this agenda.
 
""We in the evangelical community are tired of the politics of the issue and wanted to highlight conservatives who agree with us on this issue,"" Laushkin.
 
For the most part, Republicans have doused talk of global warming saying Democrats are pushing it to enforce more government regulations on the energy industry.
 
The Hill article notes that the Environmental Protection Agency has already begun to try to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and proposed carbon dioxide standards for new power plants to help mitigate the suspected effects of global warming. And that many scientists have long concluded climate change is real. But some Republicans have challenged the proposed EPA standards and questioned scientists conclusions.
 
""We’re hoping at the end of the day it will be a bi-partisan issue, one party can’t solve the issue so we want to highlight conservative leadership on this,"" said Laushkin.
 
Laushkin said he suspects that many Republican delegates who see the signs at the convention will be surprised.

But as far as the quote from Kasich, his own staff confirms its accuracy. As long as Kasich’s comments aren’t used as a scare tactic to get others to believe in climate change then the governor is OK with how he is being portrayed, Nichols said.

And that’s how the billboards convey the message. No scare tactics. Just Kasich saying he agrees climate change is a problem",True,"August 29, 2012"
"Says that as Massachusetts governor, Mitt Romney ""condemned coal-fired plants, saying they kill people.""","
Mitt Romney came to coal country on Aug. 14, standing before a crowd of miners in eastern Ohio and pledging to fight for their jobs.

You could be forgiven if you thought this was much ado about 3,150 jobs -- the number employed directly by coal operations in Ohio, at least before two mines announced layoffs recently. But Romney’s greater point was about how coal fires so many power plants in Ohio and the region, and how, he says, environmental regulation from President Barack Obama’s administration threatens jobs at those plants, too. This could drive up the cost of electricity for every Ohioan, Romney said.

This debate -- over the cost of electricity, the shift among power plants to natural gas, the environmental and health risks, the role the government should or shouldn’t play -- has been building for years. And after the event, the Obama campaign had a response, saying that Romney’s position on coal has changed substantially since he was governor of Massachusetts.

""Immediately after becoming governor, Romney condemned coal-fired plants, saying they kill people,"" said an Obama campaign news release. 
The claim was similar to one the Obama team made in a radio ad, and Obama reelection aides backed it with specific quotes Romney made in February, 2003, when Romney was the freshly elected governor of Massachusetts. 
The quotes: 
The Obama campaign also highlighted a Romney quote that had no lethal references but was just as strong. It came from a state of Massachusetts news releasein which Romney said:  ""If the choice is between dirty power plants or protecting the health of the people of Massachusetts, there is no choice in my mind. I will always come down on the side of public health.""

Romney made each of these statements during a Feb. 6, 2003, showdown over the future of the controversial, coal-burning Salem Harbor Power Station.

In 2001, Massachusetts passed new rules to reduce power plant emissions of nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and mercury, to be phased in over several years. The mercury standard would not be finalized until 2004. Romney supported the rules, as he made clear repeatedly.

Massachusetts singled out its most egregious polluters as the ""Filthy Five"" plants, including Salem Harbor. Public health and environmental scientists at Harvard studied the emissions from two of the plants in 2000 and concluded that Salem Harbor was responsible for 53 deaths, 570 emergency room visits, 14,400 asthma attacks and 99,000 incidents of upper respiratory symptoms -- all per year.

As occurs with similar studies that health authorities cite, local residents and others who wanted to keep the Salem Harbor plant open (for jobs and tax revenue) disputed those figures, saying they resulted from unproven modeling. It turned out that the Harvard scientists had revised their figures in 2002, putting premature deaths from Salem Harbor’s pollution at 30 per year and reducing the number of emergency room visits to 400 and the asthma attacks at 2,000, according to the Boston Globe and the Boston Herald.

But the scientists stood by the broader conclusion -- that emissions from dirty power plants can be deadly.  The Harvard methodology has now been widely replicated and is respected by health scientists, according to several environmental authorities we spoke with. Romney appeared to accept their findings, too. In the above-mentioned news release, the commonwealth of Massachusetts quoted Romney in the third person on the danger factor:

""Romney said that the Salem Harbor plant is responsible for 53 premature deaths, 570 emergency room visits and 14,400 asthma attacks each year. He also pointed out that coal and oil fired plants contribute significantly more air pollution than their gas fired counterparts, exacerbating acid rain and global warming.""

This was in a news release issued by the governor’s aides, not some radical outside instigator. It was issued under the name of Romney, Lt. Gov. Kerry Healey and Romney’s development chief, Douglas Foy.  According to the Boston Globe, Romney hired Foy from the  Conservation Law Foundation, or CLF, a leading environmental advocacy group in Massachusetts.

The spat with Salem Harbor turned into a testy exchange that February day after Salem Harbor’s then-owner, Pacific Gas and Electric, sought an extension until 2006 to comply with Massachusetts’ emissions rules -- and plant supporters showed up to to demand that the governor back off. Romney was adamant that the company comply by 2004. His statements that day show how he felt: ""That plant kills people."" And to those including city officials who argued that this would cost jobs: ""I will not create jobs that kill people.""

Based on some of the quotes, it might appear that Romney was speaking only about that single plant (which a new owner, Dominion, is phasing out, after which a subsequent third owner will build a natural gas plant there). That’s what we thought when we began looking into this. It is also what the Romney campaign told us in email.

So was it accurate for the Obama campaign to imply that Romney’s words characterized his broader attitude toward coal emissions when he was governor?

We kept looking, because people in the environmental community told us it was a valid claim. And the news release under Romney’s name suggested it as well.

Romney spoke of plants, not just a single one, when he pointed out that coal and oil fired plants contribute significantly more air pollution than their gas fired counterparts, exacerbating acid rain and global warming.

Still, to give him the benefit of doubt, what if he really just meant the Salem Harbor plant? Wasn’t that plant particularly egregious when compared with coal-fired plants under attack by federal regulators today?

No, say environmentalists who include authorities from the CLF.

Their claims are supported by U.S. EPA emissions data we verified independently.

""When he said that ‘this plant kills people,’ he was talking about a plant that produced pollution comparable to the emissions of plants in the Midwest,"" said Seth Kaplan, vice president for policy and climate advocacy at the conservation foundation.

Jonathan Peress, an environmental and regulatory attorney who works for the CLF and was recently chairman of the American Bar Association’s air quality committee, added in a separate interview with PolitiFact Ohio that Romney promoted Massachusetts air standards that were almost identical to those the U.S. EPA wants to enforce -- and that Romney now criticizes.

""The levels of emissions that he was talking about were levels that were virtually identical to what the EPA has proposed,"" Kaplan agreed. ""He was steadfastly standing behind emissions reductions that are the same as those currently attacked.""

To see if this was accurate -- that the emissions Romney decried were similar to or even weaker than those under current attack now by the EPA (whose rules Romney now attacks) -- we examined the emissions cuts that Massachusetts wanted and data on the level of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions at Salem Harbor and in the Midwest. The U.S. EPA keeps the information in its extensive Clean Air Markets database.

Nitrogen oxides react with sunlight to create ozone and smog. Sulfur dioxide is tied to particulate matter and is considered particularly dangerous to health, said Jonathan Walke, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund.

The level of both these substances was multiple times lower at Salem Harbor, even when Romney was trying to force the plant to reduce emissions, than at Eastlake in Northeast Ohio and several other Ohio plants we checked. Our comparisons included multiple years, including Salem Harbor in 2003 with Ohio plants in 2011. To compensate for differences in electricity output, number of boilers and hours of operation at different power plants, we checked the data for emissions per megawatt-hour. The pattern held.

""It’s all the same pollution, albeit in higher quantities in Ohio,"" Walke said.

You might ask why we looked at Eastlake. It’s because FirstEnergy Corp. plans to shut down two of that plant’s boilers rather than spend heavily on scrubbers to comply with EPA rules. This is one of several coal-burning plants at the heart of the current jobs-versus-pollution debate, although Romney did not mention it specifically.

It’s important to note that the rules on nitrogen and sulfur are not what is prompting the FirstEnergy shutdowns. New EPA rules on mercury and toxic metals are the cause of planned closures in Eastlake. The tougher limits won’t take effect until 2014. The EPA aims to cut mercury emissions by 79 percent.

But as the Massachusetts governor, Romney supported mercury reductions in his state, too. In 2004, he signed off on a rule aiming to reduce mercury emissions by 95 percent by 2012. With Romney’s name on the letterhead, Massachusetts in May, 2004, issued a lengthy set of justifications for the mercury rule. Among them:

""First, [new research] confirms and extends our understanding of mercury's harmful effects on learning, attention and other critical cognitive skills in children.  Recent studies have found that children exposed to mercury levels may show signs of attention deficit disorder, impaired visual-spatial skills and poor coordination.""

Romney was ""a champion"" of those mercury regulations, said Shanna Cleveland, a staff attorney with the Conservation Law Foundation. ""He was one of the reasons we got them through.""

Time to clean up: Romney was discussing a specific power plant, Salem Harbor, when he said,  ""That plant kills people."" But the public record shows that his comments were part of a broad emissions-cutting program he embraced.

And the power plant that he considered deadly had emissions that were no worse, and in many cases lower, than at Midwest plants that he would now wants left alone, citing the use of affordable and abundant coal.

If one were to have supported the regulations Romney wanted in 2003, it’s fairly safe to assume that ""one would also support such things nationally,"" said Jonathan Levy, an environmental scientist at  Boston University and Harvard and co-author of the now heavily replicated study on the correlation between coal-burning power plants and respiratory health.

The Obama campaign claimed that as governor, Romney condemned coal plants as killers. He spoke at times of a single plant, but at other times made clear that other plants also needed to cut emissions for the sake of public health. This even included new rules for mercury reductions -- the same substance from coal plants that now is prompting closures in Ohio.

The debate over coal involves calculations of costs, the abundance or scarcity of natural resources, health and environmental risks, and attitudes about government regulation. It is not our role to say Romney was right or wrong at one time.

But with additional information from emissions data, interviews and the public record of his governorship,  the Obama campaign claim about Romney’s coal position of nine years ago is nearly as clear as a haze-free day",Mostly True,"August 23, 2012"
"Claims Joe Biden said ""coal is more dangerous than terrorists.""","
Ohio looms large in this year's presidential race, but Mitt Romney staged an Aug. 14 campaign rally in one of its smallest and poorest places, the village of Beallsville.

Its population is about 400, the median household income is about $23,000, or roughly half the state average. It once gained fame for having the highest per-capita number of residents killed in the Vietnam War of any community in the country. Six men were killed, from its then-population of 475.

Beallsville is also in the heart of southeastern Ohio's Appalachian coal country.

With a group of miners serving as his backdrop, Romney accused President Obama of ""waging war on coal"" through his energy policies.

""His vice president said coal is more dangerous than terrorists,"" Romney said. ""Can you imagine that? This tells you precisely what he (Obama) actually feels and what he's done and his policies over the last three and a half years have put in place the very vision he had when he was running for office.""

Did Vice President Biden really compare coal to terrorism? PolitiFact Ohio was interested.

Romney's campaign told us that the support for Romney's claim was s 2007 interview on HBO’s ""Real Time With Bill Maher."" The video clip has been making the rounds on the Internet for years.

Maher asked Biden, who was then a candidate for the 2008 presidential nomination, what he thought ""is more likely to contribute to the death of your average American: a terrorist strike or high-fructose corn syrup and air that has too much coal in it?""

Biden responded: ""Air that has too much coal in it, corn syrup next, then a terrorist attack, but -- that is not in any way to diminish the fact that a terrorist attack is real. It is not an existential threat to bringing down the country, but it does have the capacity, still, to kill thousands of people. But hundreds of thousands of people die and their lives are shortened because of coal plants, coal-fired plants and because of corn syrup.""

Biden was not volunteering a comparison between coal-fired pollution and terrorism, nor was he speculating about ""danger."" He was answering a direct question about likely causes of death.

And, his comment about coal and air pollution was accurate.

The American Lung Association issued a report last year, ""Toxic Air,"" which documented the range of hazardous air pollutants emitted from coal-burning power plants. It called for the installation of cleanup technology as the most effective way to reduce them.

""Coal-fired power plants produce electricity for the nation’s power grid, but they also produce more hazardous air emissions than any other industrial pollution sources,"" the report said. ""Their emissions threaten the health of people who live near these plants, as well as those who live hundreds of miles away.""

The Lung Association report said, ""Particle pollution from power plants is estimated to kill approximately 13,000 people a year.""

A similar report with essentially the same conclusion was issued six months earlier for a study commissioned by the Clean Air Task Force, a national nonprofit research and advocacy organization dedicated to air quality and environmental issues.

""Fine particle pollution from existing coal plants is expected to cause nearly 13,200 deaths in 2010,"" the analysis found. ""Additional impacts include an estimated 9,700 hospitalizations and more than 20,000 heart attacks per year.""

The comprehensive study was the third commissioned by the organization, which maintains that adding pollution control technologies to power plants ""is not just good for public health; it is also good for the nation’s economy.""

Possibly because the latest study found that ""coal plant emissions of key particle-forming pollutants like sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) have declined significantly over the last several years,"" its estimate of 13,200 deaths ""compares to an estimate of nearly 24,000 deaths per year from existing plants in the 2004 study.""

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated that a proposed air-transport rule to curb sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide from coal-fired power plants would save 14,000 to 36,000 lives a year and help prevent 21,000 cases of bronchitis and 23,000 heart attacks.

The lowest of those one-year estimates for the United States is larger than the 2011 worldwide total of deaths, 12,533,  that the National Counterrorism Center attributes to terrorism, which U.S. law defines as ""premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents.""

According to the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) and its Global Terrorism Database (GTD), 2,997 people died in the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.  More people died in the 9/11 attacks than in all other U.S. terrorist attacks from 1970 to 2010.

Since the 9/11 attacks and through 2010, the most recent year with verified statistics in the GTD, ""the total number of individuals killed in attacks in the U.S. is 32,"" the consortium told us. ""Twenty-eight of the 32 were U.S. citizens. The nationalities of the others is unknown.

""There were no fatalities (from) 2003 to 2007,"" the year in which Biden gave his comment.
(High-fructose corn syrup is not relevant here. It was not part of Romney's statement, and it was grouped with air pollution as a single unit by the wording of Maher's question, ""terrorist strike or high-fructose corn syrup and air."")

What does this stack up to?

There is an element of truth in Romney's statement. Biden did say -- accurately -- that coal-fired air pollution is more likely to contribute to the death of an average American than is terrorism.

But Romney portrayed Biden’s remark as part of ""waging war on coal.""

Rather, PolitiFact found that Biden previously has voiced support for ""clean coal,""  calling for ""carbon capture and sequestration technologies that will allow us to use coal cleanly"" in the energy plan he released during his presidential campaign in 2007. ""Clean coal"" is not a type of coal; the phrase refers to a number of technologies, some in use and others early in the development stage, which would allow the burning of coal for energy without the harmful pollution that coal-fired power plants currently emit.

Biden's statement was made in response to a question and he was addressing health impacts of coal-fired air pollution -- not making a statement about coal or coal energy. He was not making a comparison between terrorism and coal. Yet, Romney’s comment implies that was the case and portrays Biden’s comment was as part of an administration policy against the coal industry.

Those are critical facts that Romney’s claim ignores would give the listener a different impression",Mostly False,"August 17, 2012"
"""This ban will only apply to Oregon commercial fishermen. Washington commercial fishermen would still be allowed to use gillnets on the Columbia River.""","
Oregon Ballot Measure 81 would prohibit the use of gillnets by nontribal commercial fishermen in the Oregon side of the Columbia River. Advocates of the ban say the outdated nets kill all sorts of fish, including protected native salmon.

Opponents, however, say the measure is nothing but a power grab by sports fishermen, who want more fish bites. Brenda Wall is on the board of Salmon for All, an organization that represents gillnetters. In a guest column published in The Oregonian, she argues that the ban  would allow Washington fisheries to continue to use gillnets in the Columbia River, but not Oregon fisheries.

""This ban will only apply to Oregon commercial fishermen. Washington commercial fishermen would still be allowed to use gill nets on the Columbia River,"" she writes.  

This prompted a query from a reader to PolitiFact Oregon: ""Is it true that the measure restricts Oregon fishermen on the same river where Washington fishermen would not be restricted?"" Great question. (Readers, send us more questions!) We’d like to add another question to that: Would a ban, if approved by Oregon voters, only apply to Oregon fishermen but exempt Washington fishermen?

To explain the answers to these questions, we need to give readers a quick rundown of how fish runs work in the Columbia River.

Oregon and Washington have concurrent jurisdiction over the Columbia, which forms much of the border between the two. Nontribal commercial gillnetting is authorized in the 140-mile stretch west of Bonneville Dam to the Pacific Ocean. For the most part, the physical boundary between Oregon and Washington is sliced down the middle of the river. But as you move westward toward the mouth of the river, maps clearly show that more of the Columbia is within the Oregon state line.

However, fish don’t respect state lines, so the two states work together to manage for endangered species. Washington and Oregon together decide when to allow sports and commercial fishermen to fish on the river. Washington issues licenses and permits to its people, and Oregon issues licenses and permits to its people and the two states recognize the validity of the other’s licenses and permits in their part of the river. This is all highly regulated and tightly coordinated.

The ballot measure aims to amend Oregon Revised Statutes 508.775 to read: (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of the commercial fishing laws, it is unlawful for an individual to use a gillnet or tangle net to take salmon, steelhead or other fish in the inland waters of the state of Oregon. (new language is in italics, bold.)

So let’s say Oregon voters approve Ballot Measure 81 in November. Would the ban apply only to Oregon commercial fishermen, and not Washington commercial fishermen, in Oregon’s side of the river? No, state law applies equally to all. Would a gillnetting ban mean that Washington commercial fishermen could continue to use gillnets on the Columbia River? Yes, an Oregon ban has no authority in waters outside Oregon. Washington fishermen could continue to use gillnets on their side of the river. We could have split regulation down the river.

""This doesn’t apply to Washington,"" said Rick Hargrave, a spokesman for Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. ""Washington commercial gillnetters can continue to do their thing in Washington waters.""  

Guy Norman, regional director for Washington’s Department of Fish and Wildlife, says the goal always is concurrent regulation. ""However, if we are unable to attain concurrent regulation, for one reason or another, then each state reserves the right to set regulations within their respective boundaries,"" he said.

Certainly this ballot measure would upend the idea of reciprocity between the states. How that plays out, nobody knows yet.

For example, will Washington state allow Oregon fishermen to use gillnets in Washington water? Will Washington follow Oregon in prohibiting gillnets? Those are policy questions for Washington to address. Likewise, we don’t know the logistics of how enforcement might be carried out.

PolitiFact Oregon can’t rule on how Washington might respond should the measure be approved, because those decisions haven’t been made. But we can rule on what the measure says it will do, and there’s no real argument from the two campaign sides: Ballot Measure 81 prohibits the use of gillnets in the inland waters of the state of Oregon.

The point made by Brenda Wall is that the measure does nothing to prevent Washington commercial fishermen from using gillnets on their side of the river. The ""Stop Gillnets Now"" campaign objects to the assessment because Wall gives the impression that Washington fishermen can continue to use gillnets throughout the Columbia, when they wouldn’t. They would be limited to their side of the river.

It is not accurate to say that the Oregon ban would apply only to Oregon commercial fishermen. It is accurate to say that Washington commercial fishermen can continue to use gillnets in the Columbia -- so long as they stick to their side of the river.

"After the 9/11 terrorist attacks grounded commercial air traffic, ""there was a temperature drop while the airplanes weren't flying, for the week afterwards.""","In their first debate last month, three Republicans seeking Rhode Island’s 2nd Congressional District seat -- Michael J. Gardiner, Michael G. Riley and Kara D. Russo -- were discussing the role fossil fuels should play in a national energy strategy when the issue of climate change emerged.

When Russo questioned whether climate change even existed, considering there is ""so much . . . propaganda about global warming,"" Gardiner, a Providence lawyer, said human activity had ""clearly"" affected climate.

As an example, he pointed to the three days after the 9/11 terrorist attacks when all commercial planes were grounded over the United States.

""We did see in 9/11, we did see I believe there was a temperature drop while the airplanes weren't flying, for the week afterwards, that there was an average temperature drop,"" he said.  ""So I think clearly there are man-made effects.""

We wondered whether Gardiner knew of some new research confirming the much-discussed theory in the 11 years since the attacks.

The theory caught wide attention a year after the attacks when University of Wisconsin-Whitewater Prof. David Travis and two colleagues published a study -- here’s a summary -- that found that the absence of jet vapor trails in the skies during the three-day flying hiatus had a climatological effect.

Travis and his colleagues had collected the daily high and low temperatures for those days from 4,000 weather stations across the country and compared the data with the same three-day period in each year from 1971 through 2000.

They determined that without contrails acting as artificial clouds trapping in heat (and to a lesser extent blocking the sun) the average daily temperature range over the continent had widened by about two degrees. In other words, the average low temperature dropped a bit while the average high temperature rose slightly.

Since then other studies have questioned whether the lack of contrails in the skies during those three days after the attacks actually played any role in the widened temperature variations that Travis reported. They have suggested that the temperature change Travis found might have been a coincidence -- the result of unusually clear weather during the period the jets were grounded.

When contacted by PolitiFact Rhode Island, Gardiner said he was relying on past news stories when he made his claim that the temperature had dropped while air flight was suspended.

After reading those news stories again, Gardiner acknowledged in an e-mail that he had misspoken during the candidates’ debate; Travis’ study showed a widened daily temperature range in both directions following the terrorist attacks -- not just a drop in temperature -- and, said Gardiner,  ""indeed there is controversy surrounding the observations . . . ""

Said Gardiner, ""I do a better job of illuminating a path for discussion and thought than 'nailing' a precise scientifically unassailable statement.""

"The United States can immediately tap a domestic energy resource of ""more than 1.5 trillion barrels of oil, six times more than Saudi Arabia.""","As Wisconsinites geared up to hit the highway for the Fourth of July, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde declared American energy independence as easy as 1, 2, 3.

Here’s the solution to high gas prices and overreliance on foreign oil, a
Hovde campaign news release said on July 2, 2012:

1.  ""Immediately tap into America’s natural resources: More than 1.5 trillion barrels of oil (six times more than Saudi Arabia); 272 trillion cubic feet of natural gas; and more than half the world’s oil shale supply.""

2. ""End the moratorium on domestic drilling on public lands.""

3. ""Build the Keystone XL pipeline.""

There has been much debate about drilling on public lands and the Keystone XL pipeline, which would move oil sands crude from Canada to Gulf of Mexico refineries. But there’s been little discussion of the claim that America has an untapped domestic oil source that tops oil-rich Saudi Arabia by a factor of six.

Is Hovde right?

Hovde’s campaign pointed us to the Republican website for the House Natural Resources Committee, chaired by U.S. Rep. Doc Hastings (R-Washington).

""According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) the U.S. holds more than half of the world’s oil shale resources,"" the site says. ""The most recent estimates (April, 2009) show the region may hold more than 1.5 trillion barrels of oil – six times Saudi Arabia’s proven resources, and enough to provide the United States with energy for the next 200 years.""

Hovde, the committee website and the USGS are talking about the same thing -- the Green River Formation in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming. But each is using some critically different ways to describe it.

The Green River Formation is considered the world’s largest oil shale resource, but only sporadic attempts have been made to explore it -- typically when oil prices spike.

The reason: It’s not crude oil that lies beneath the surface, as in Saudi Arabia. It’s oil shale, a solid organic compound that can be converted to oil only when heated to great temperatures. The USGS made clear when it announced its findings in 2009.

Huge obstacles including costs, technology and environmental concerns have stood in the way.

Let’s start with the non-partisan source, the Geological Survey. Pressed by Congress during a gas-price spike several years ago, the survey analyzed the oil shale resource and determined the Colorado section of the formation by far the most promising.

They estimated that 1.525 trillion barrels of ""in-place oil shale resources"" lie in the Colorado section. That’s the number Hovde and the Republican website mention.

But each shortens that to ""oil"" -- and that’s a big difference. The Geological Survey describes oil shale as ""pre oil"" because it is not ready-made crude.

And the agency’s assessment made an important point: No economically viable extraction method is currently available in the United States, because the process is so technologically and environmentally challenging compared to conventional extraction of actual crude oil.

""Much of the resource in Colorado, where the richest deposits of high grade oil shale exist, are buried deep enough that mining is considered impractical or prohibitively difficult and expensive,"" said Justin Birdwell, a USGS research engineer studying the resource, in an interview. The focus, therefore has been on underground processing technologies, which are unproven.

Given this backdrop, the agency concluded in 2009 that it’s unknown how much of that 1.5 trillion barrels is recoverable. That’s still true today, although the agency is developing estimates. Recovery of oil is years or decades away, certainly not ""immediate"" as Hovde described it.

Additionally, when it comes to the Saudi Arabia comparison, Hovde runs into a major apples-to-oranges problem when he says the 1.5 trillion ""barrels of oil"" in the Green River Formation is ""six times more"" than in Saudi Arabia.

He is comparing Saudi Arabia’s 266 billion of ""proved resources"" with the 1.5 trillion in the Green River Formation -- but the latter number is only an estimate of the total ""in-place"" in the formation, without regard to the ability to get it out or get a viable price for it.

It’s a ""major distinction,"" as a Congressional Research Service paper on US fossil fuel resources noted in 2010.

""Proved reserves are those amounts of oil, natural gas, or coal that have been discovered and defined, typically by drilling wells or other exploratory measures, and which can be economically recovered,"" the study said.

In terms of proved reserves, the US has 20.7 billion barrels -- 13 times less than Saudi Arabia, according to the latest data from the Energy Information Administration, a US government agency.

The Republican website Hovde cites was more precise and cautious than the candidate. It said the region ""may hold"" more than 1.5 trillion barrels, and explicitly compared that to the Saudi’s ""proven"" resources.

Hovde omitted the qualifiers.

In any case, according to two Congressional Research Service studies, oil shale ""makes poor feedstock for making gasoline, so it might primarily be a source of other liquid middle distillate fuels such as jet fuel or diesel oil, fuels for which there is significant national demand.""

Finally, Hovde’s claim reminded us of a February 2012 item by PolitiFact National that rated Mostly False a claim by Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich. He said that by one estimate the United States  may have ""three times as much oil in the United States as there is in Saudi Arabia.""

That item noted the same apples-to-oranges problem in the comparison.

Our rating

Hovde suggested that we immediately tap into America’s natural resources, which he said are ""more than 1.5 trillion barrels of oil (six times more than Saudi Arabia).""

Hovde referred to a massive western United States formation of oil shale, and there’s a kernel of truth in that government officials estimate that 1.5 trillion barrels are contained there.

But Hovde omits a critical fact: He’s comparing that uncertain oil shale resource with Saudi oil reserves that have been discovered and defined and can be extracted economically. It’s unknown what the western formation will yield, and it certainly won’t come immediately",Mostly False,"July 12, 2012"
"By eliminating the public intervenor’s office, ""I was the first one to fire Kathleen Falk.""","
Republican U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson made an extra effort to demonstrate his passion for property rights while addressing a tea party audience in Oconomowoc on June 4, 2012.

He talked up life on his 700-acre farm. He said as governor he ""took on the DNR"" -- the Department of Natural Resources -- and also took control of appointing the agency’s leader. He blasted ""Agenda 21,"" the United Nations environmental program.

And, with a touch of glee in his voice, he recounted how as governor he got rid of Kathleen Falk as a public intervenor, a position in the state Attorney General’s office that served as a sort of watchdog in environmental disputes.

Falk, a Democrat appointed to the position by Attorney General Bronson La Follette, later was elected four times as Dane County executive. She lost races for governor in 2002, attorney general in 2006 and governor again in the 2012 recall primary.

""Who had the guts to take away the public intervenor in this state?"" Thompson said at a meeting of the Lake Country Area Defenders of Liberty.

""I got rid of Kathleen Falk!"" he added, to big laughs in the crowd. ""I was the first one to fire Kathleen Falk!""

Did then-Governor Thompson eliminate the public intervenor’s office, getting ""rid"" of Falk and becoming the ""first to fire"" her?

Let’s roll back the clock.

The issue arose in 1995, when Thompson -- then in his third term as governor -- sought to eliminate the public intervenor’s office in his two-year budget.

""It’s a law office hired by the state to sue us,"" Thompson complained at the time. He considered the intervenors ""state-financed lawyers for the environmental movement.""

Proponents said the office saved the state money by solving problems and heading off lawsuits by environmental groups.

The office was created in 1969 by Gov. Warren Knowles, a Republican, as an independent mediator to represent the public's interest in court and state agency decisions.

The intervenors were assistant attorneys who often sued other state agencies to register objections to plans for highway, dredging and mining projects.

When Thompson made his move, two assistant attorneys general -- Falk and Thomas Dawson -- had full-time intervenor status. Both had served as intervenors under both Republican and Democratic attorneys general.

In his budget bill, Thompson proposed doing away with the intervenor’s office by wiping out the attorney general’s authority to appoint intervenors.

Although Republicans both chambers of the Legislature, the Senate passed a compromise abolishing one intervenor, and moving the other to the Thompson-controlled DNR with no power to sue.

Two years later, the Legislature and Thompson eliminated the DNR position, with Democrats saying it had little authority.

So Thompson can take credit for abolishing the office, which directly led to Falk losing the intervenor job.

But does that mean Thompson fired her?

Both Falk and Dawson stayed on as assistant attorneys general, just doing different assignments. Both positions were under the civil service system, so they could not lose their job by the stroke of Thompson’s pen.

Falk stayed in the office for about two years until she left in 1997 to become Dane County executive. Dawson is a staff attorney in the office. Though Falk and others campaigned in subsequent years for restoring the intervenor’s office, it was never brought back.

Thompson, of course, said he was the ""first"" to fire Falk.

His campaign said he meant that statewide voters had later rejected her. That rings hollow because she never lost a campaign while holding an office. How can you be ""fired"" from a job you don’t have?

Our rating

Thompson said he was the ""first to fire"" Falk by eliminating the environmental watchdog known as the state public intervenor’s office.

In making the remark, he did so in the context of abolishing the office, so he’s on target there.

In a colloquial sense, ""fired"" may fit because Thompson knew Falk would no longer be intervenor due to his actions. But he went too far in leaving the impression Falk was out on the street. And Falk was never removed from any other job we know of, so Thompson misfired with ""first to fire",Half True,"July 5, 2012"
"""No one in Rhode Island -- not just children, no one in Rhode Island -- should eat more than one serving of freshwater fish caught in our state each month.""","
Are Rhode Island's lakes and rivers so contaminated from air pollution that originates from out of state that it's unsafe to eat more than one serving per month of fish caught here?

That's what Sheldon Whitehouse said on June 19, 2012, when he urged his colleagues in the U.S. Senate to approve new standards for mercury contamination caused by air pollution emitted from coal-burning power plants in states to our west.

After contending that lives would be saved, heart attacks would be prevented and emergency-room visits would be reduced if the new restrictions were finally put in place, Whitehouse turned to fishing to describe some of the intangible problems caused by the airborne mercury that lands in Rhode Island.

Whitehouse displayed an image of a Norman Rockwell painting, ""Catching the Big One,"" from the Aug. 3, 1929, issue of the Saturday Evening Post. It shows a boy and his grandfather fishing.

""That image in Rhode Island is shadowed by the fact that this small child would not be allowed to eat any freshwater fish that he caught with his grandfather because of this mercury pollution that has been bombarded in on us by these power plants that did not clean up their act,"" the senator said.

According to the Rhode Island Department of Health, he said, ""No one in Rhode Island -- not just children, no one in Rhode Island -- should eat more than one serving of freshwater fish caught in our state each month. So if the grandfather caught two fish, he could eat one [in] a month, but he shouldn't eat the other because of the health effects of the mercury that has piled up in the bodies of the fish.""

No children should be eating local freshwater fish and no adult should eat more than one serving per month? We wondered if the pollution was really that bad.

So, perched at our computer, we checked the Health Department's website, where we found the latest test results for 31 bodies of fresh water.

The chart says, as Whitehouse said, that nobody should be eating fish caught in Yawgoog Pond or Wincheck Pond, both in Hopkinton, or in the Quidnick Reservoir, in Coventry.  It also says fish other than trout in Meadow Brook Pond in Richmond shouldn't be eaten. (Trout are an exception because they are raised by the state on a mercury-free diet.)

It also says that none of the freshwater fish caught in the state should be eaten by women who are pregnant, nursing or planning a pregnancy or by children under age 7.

And what about everybody else?

In 12 of the 31 areas (13 if you count trout from Meadow Brook Pond), the Health Department says it's safe for adults and children over 6 to eat the fish in unlimited amounts, according to the chart. There's no once-a-month restriction.

In 13 other areas, the consumption should be limited to once per week for most adults and older children.

Only in 3 of the 31 areas does the state say that mercury pollution makes it unsafe to eat more than one fish meal a month: Watchaug Pond, in Charlestown, and Tucker and Yawgoo Ponds in South Kingstown.

The same day we called Whitehouse's office asking for the source of his information, spokesman Seth Larson called back to say that the senator's staff was using the same source we found.

""It turns out we made an error in preparing the senator's remarks,"" he said, promising a quick correction.

The next day, on the floor of the Senate, Whitehouse said that he erred in his statement. ""I would suggest Rhode Islanders consult the Health Department's website where the agency lists fish advisories by pond and by river and that way Rhode Islanders can make an informed decision for themselves and their families as to where and when our fish are safe to eat for mercury contamination,"" he said.

That's easier said than done because the Health Department data are outdated and confusing, so consumers may end up more perplexed than before.

Its mercury testing wasn't done systematically because of a lack of funding. Most rivers, lakes and ponds have not been tested at all. The results on the waters that were tested are from 1996 to 2000. No testing has been done since then because, again, the department hasn't had the money. And the data posted online sometimes contradict what Health Department official Robert Vanderslice says the department has been recommending.

For example, in the waters listed as being safe (where everyone except for small children, pregnant women and nursing women ""can consume any amount safely""), the website doesn't make it clear that the findings don't apply at all to largemouth and smallmouth bass, chain pickerel, black crappie or eel. Those species eat other fish and tend to concentrate mercury in their bodies, Vanderslice explained.

That eliminates most of the fish people would want to eat.

""You cannot predict from one pond to the next"" how much mercury will be in fish because the amount can vary from pond to pond, and from time to time, he said. ""If you sample one pond, you know about that one pond at that time for the species you sampled.""

""What our data show is that when you're freshwater fishing in Rhode Island, you don't know what the levels are,"" said Vanderslice. ""The best way you're assured to being safe is to limit how much fish you eat, vary where you fish and change the type of fish you eat.""

That's not very reassuring to adults who may have repeatedly eaten fish from the dozen areas listed as safe by the Health Department.

Whitehouse, in his followup Senate speech, said the larger point remains: ""Mercury contamination is a continuing public health problem in Rhode Island and one that we can do very little about without EPA standing up for us and defending us. Because in these other states it is a great deal for them to be about to poison our state's waters but get cheaper power in their states because they don't force their utilities to put scrubbers on and to keep themselves operating at appropriate levels of pollution control.""

Our ruling

Sheldon Whitehouse said that ""No one in Rhode Island -- not just children, no one in Rhode Island -- should eat more than one serving of freshwater fish caught in our state each month.""

Whitehouse made that absolute statement based on a Health Department web page indicating that his statement wasn't true for 25 of the 31 freshwater bodies. Not only can older children and most adults eat fish caught there more than once a month, in at least a dozen areas they can eat it as often as they'd like, it said.

Whitehouse acknowledged misstating the posted test results.

But fish from those limited areas haven't been tested in more than a decade, a lapse in public health monitoring we find disturbing.

And the data are, at times, so at odds with what the Health Department says it is recommending, any conclusion drawn from them should be accompanied by a hefty dose of skepticism.

Mercury pollution poses a signIficant public health problem and clearly consumers should be wary about eating freshwater fish caught in state waters. That's a large kernel of truth in Whitehouse's statement",Half True,"July 2, 2012"
"""(Environmentalists) said ‘We’re only going to stop coal mining above 2,000 feet.’ ... Well guess where all the coal in the state of Tennessee is? Above 2,000 feet.""","
For years now, state legislators have been arguing over whether to prohibit ""mountaintop coal mining"" in Tennessee and the debate is likely to continue next year since the bill failed again in the 2012 session. In the Legislature's off season, Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey spoke at a rally for coal mining supporters and criticized a central provision of the bill.

""(Environmentalists) said ‘We’re only going to stop coal mining above 2,000 feet.’ ... Well guess where all the coal in the state of Tennessee is? Above 2,000 feet,"" said Ramsey, as quoted by the Kingsport Times-News at the Abingdon, Va., rally in early June.

The Senate speaker has made similar comments in other discussions of the bill (SB577), which prohibits that state Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) from issuing any surface coal mining permits on a site above 2,000 feet in elevation.

Where did that figure come from?

Dawn Coppick, an attorney, who as legislative director of the Lindquist Appalachian Environmental Fellowship (LEAF), helped draft the bill and lobby for passage, says the 2,000-foot level is based on the U.S. Forest Service's classification of ""ecological subregions."" That amounts to a distinct area, in effect counting as a mountain in Tennessee.

Basically, everything above 2,000 feet on the Cumberland Plateau is deemed within such a subregion by the Forest Service and, thus, provides a ""scientifically sound rational basis"" for drawing a line, said Coppick. If the law were passed and challenged in court, judges would look to whether there is a ""rational basis"" for distinguishing one coal-bearing area from another, she said, and the ""ecological subregion"" would meet the legal criteria.

The Ramsey remark suggests that the legislation, if passed, would effectively block coal mining in Tennessee because all coal is above 2,000 feet in elevation. Is that accurate?

Well, no.

Supporters of the bill, opponents of the bill and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation uniformly say there is lots of coal in Tennessee below the 2,000-foot elevation level. And there are maps that show it..

A TDEC map of the state's coal-mining areas with the 2,000-foot elevation marked shows relatively small portions of the overall coal reserves would be included in the proposed ban. LEAF has a map on its website that is more generalized while making the point more clearly to the viewer.

But Chuck Laine, president of the Tennessee Mining Association, says there's an underlying basis for Ramsey's comment in that the only marketable coal that can be gathered by surface mining is above 2,000 feet. A ban on mining above 2,000 feet, he contends, would have the practical effect of prohibiting surface mining in Tennessee.

Coal is classified in different grades based on BTUs generated when it is burned, sulfur content, PH balance and moisture content.Currently, Laine said, the only marketable coal is that in the higher grades, known as ""thermal coal,"" which meets Environmental Protection Agency specifications for generating electricity in steam plants such as those operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority.

""We couldn't sell our lower-grade coal,"" he said. ""It's just not usable... For higher-grade coal, you have to go above 2,000 feet in Tennessee.""

Coppick, on the other hand, says she knows of no evidence to back up that assertion.

Without getting into the merits of the legislation, it still may be appropriate to note the regulatory environment for coal mining in Tennessee. TDEC spokeswoman Meg Lockhart gave this explanation in an email:

""TDEC’s authority at mine sites is limited to regulation of discharges and other impacts to waters, which the department controls through the use of permits issued under Tennessee’s water quality law.
The United States Department of Interior, Office of Surface Mining (OSM) issues the permits for the actual coal mining operation. The federal SMCRA permit authorizes the mining of coal as well as the method or type of mining used.

""While OSM does allow mining companies to remove earth to reach coal seams, Tennessee does not allow mine spoil to be deposited in Tennessee streams as some other states do -- regardless of the ridge line elevation. Therefore, mountaintop removal mining is not permitted or practiced in Tennessee as it is in states such as Kentucky and West Virginia.

""Again, Tennessee water quality laws do not allow mining companies to fill valleys with the spoil as it would impair streams. Instead, this waste rock must be stored and returned to its approximate original contour. This mining method is called cross-ridge mining and the correct term for the activity allowed in Tennessee. Additionally, the spoil must be stored while the coal is removed, then replaced and re-vegetated once mining is complete. During this process, ponds must be engineered to capture runoff and control sedimentation.""

At present, TDEC has issued 30 permits for coal mining in the state but about half of them are apparently not in use with coal prices down from levels a few years back. The Knoxville office of OSM, in its annual report last year, listed 15 active Tennessee coal mines – five underground and 10 surface.

While no breakdown of mine locations by elevation was available from TDEC, Laine says that all of the surface operations are above 2,000 feet.

We invited Ramsey and his staff to defend or elaborate on his statement after explaining that it appears to be mistaken. There was no response.

It appears the lieutenant governor has erroneously extrapolated from the coal industry's assertion that there is no marketable coal below the 2,000-foot  elevation to declare there is no coal, marketable or otherwise, below that level in our state",False,"June 30, 2012"
"""Three of our cities are among the top five worst cities in the U.S. for asthma.""","
Even as coal advocates applied political pressure on Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, the state’s senior senator stood his ground in refusing to join the fight to kill the Environmental Protection Agency’s planned implementation of clean air rules.

Commercials by the group American Commitment, a conservative group recently focusing on boosting the coal industry,  branded him an ally of what it calls a ""war on coal"" by President Obama. The group asked people to call and write Alexander to make him switch his stance and vote for a resolution by Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, to disapprove the EPA's new Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) for power plants.

Alexander responded by saying he was ""standing up for Tennessee."" He cited the pollution created from ""dirty air"" blowing into Tennessee from other states causing smog in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and even pointed out that more Tennesseans work for companies that make pollution-control equipment required under the rule than work mining coal.

At a Congressional field hearing of the House Oversight and Government Reforms Committee in Murfreesboro, Alexander also claimed that one result of  ""dirty air"" is that, in Tennessee, ""three of our cities are among the top five worst cities in the U.S. for asthma.""

We decided to see if that was indeed true.

A quick primer on asthma from the Mayo Clinic: It is ""a condition in which your airways narrow and swell and produce extra mucus. This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath.""

The Mayo Clinic says, ""It isn't clear why some people get asthma and others don't, but it's probably due to a combination of environmental and genetic (inherited) factors.""

Alexander’s office said he was referring to the 2012 Asthma Capitals rankings released in May by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA). The AAFA  describes itself as a non-profit founded in 1953 that ""is the leading patient organization for people with asthma and allergies, and the oldest asthma and allergy patient group in the world.""

Sure enough, the rankings have Memphis at No. 1, Knoxville at No. 3 and Chattanooga at No. 5, with New Haven, Conn., at No. 2 and Pittsburgh, Pa., at No. 4. And it was apparently no fluke -- the 2011 rankings had those Tennessee cities ranked Nos. 2-4, though Knoxville was ahead of Memphis last year.

Nashville, it’s worth noting, ranked No. 26 this year after coming in at No. 10 in 2011.

It’s important to note that the AAFA emphasizes the rankings are an attempt to measure which cities ""are more challenging places to live"" for asthma sufferers, not necessarily just a listing of places with the highest prevalence of people suffering with asthma. The report also notes that air pollution is not the only factor it considers, with a total of 12 data sets that include the number of high-ozone days, pollen counts, medication utilization, poverty rates and public smoking laws.

Our ruling

Alexander wasn’t saying dirty air was the only reason Tennessee cities rank high on a list showing the most challenging cities in the country for asthma, just that the nation’s 17th-largest state placed three of its cities in the top five of those rankings",True,"June 24, 2012"
"""There’s no wildlife"" in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.","
We’re guessing most Floridians don’t know much about the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, located about 5,000 miles away from us in Alaska’s northeast corner.

But if we had to bet, we’d probably say it contains at least one thing. There’s gotta be wildlife, right?

Wrong, says former U.S. Rep. Dave Weldon, the Republican newcomer in the U.S. Senate race. Weldon is vying with several candidates, including U.S. Rep. Connie Mack, to win the Republican nomination and run against incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson in November.

One way Weldon really breaks from Nelson, he said, is he wants to drill for oil in the refuge to lessen dependence on foreign sources. (The refuge is commonly called ANWR and pronounced an-whar.)

In an interview on Central Florida News 13’s Political Connections show, Weldon emphatically said there is no wildlife in the refuge.

""We should be drilling up there,"" he said. ""I don’t know why Democrats have been opposing that for years. I have been up there. There’s a ton of oil up there, and there’s no wildlife. We drill in something like 15 wildlife refuges in the lower 48. I just don’t understand why Democrats like Bill Nelson don’t want to drill up there.

""I have gone up there. It’s like a moonscape. There’s no trees, there’s no animals. They call it the wildlife refuge, but there’s absolutely nothing up there. It’s just tundra, it’s ice. And in my opinion you can drill safely up there.""

A reader asked us to examine his comments about wildlife, especially after she found conflicting information right away on the refuge website that boasts of ""42 fish species, 37 land mammals, eight marine mammals, and more than 200 migratory and resident bird species.""

So is the area more like a moonscape or a serengeti?

For this fact-check, we’re focusing on a simple question: Is there wildlife on the refuge? For now, we’re staying away from the debate of whether wildlife would be affected by oil drilling in the refuge.

Congress created the refuge in 1960 and expanded and renamed it in 1980. Part of the law required 1.5 million of its 19 million acres be set aside for possible oil and gas development, which would need congressional approval.

Congress has never approved that. Several environmental groups urged Obama to declare the refuge a national monument so that it never happens. He has not.

The refuge is about the size of South Carolina. Its tundra terrain is sometimes mountainous, sometimes forested, and sometimes plains.

Located east of the Prudhoe Bay oil field, the refuge could possess one of the country’s largest untapped onshore supply of oil. (You can read more about that in this PolitiFact report, which examined Sarah Palin’s 2008 claim that ANWR drilling would affect ""2,000 out of 20-million acres."")

Weldon does have a point about there being no trees. While the southern part of the refuge, known as the boreal forest, is heavily forested, the greenery turns to shrubs and grass farther north.

""This is a tundra biome, not a forest,"" said Alan Springer, a research professor at the Institute of Marine Science at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks. ""That fact hardly diminishes its intrinsic value as a pristine, unique ecosystem within the borders of the United States.""

The area eyed for drilling has ""extensive vegetation cover that is nearly continuous, except for gravel bars along rivers, a few sandy dunes, and rocky beaches along the Arctic coast,"" said David Payer, the refuge’s supervisory ecologist since 2001 and a veterinarian. (Read more about wildlife in the refuge in this booklet.)

Yes, there is wildlife

Without question, there are animals in the refuge, even in the zone that most people eye for drilling, known as ""1002."" Weldon told us in an interview that is the location to which he was referring, but he’s still wrong about wildlife here.

The Arctic’s long, dark winter isn’t conducive to a lot of wildlife, but several kinds of animal species stick it out during those months, Payer said.

He points to Muskoxen, wolves, wolverines, Arctic and red foxes, polar and grizzly bears (they stay in their winter dens, but they’re still there), as well as a number of bird species, including ptarmigan and ravens. Lemmings and other small creatures live beneath the outer layer of snow, which acts as an insular blanket.

During the few summer months, large congregations of animals gather and breed, particularly on the coastal plain, he said. Hundreds of thousands of migratory birds, including several kinds of imperiled shorebirds, come each year.

The Porcupine caribou herd, estimated at 169,000 members, depend on the treeless tundra terrain of the coastal plain to raise their young, typically in June and July.

Polar bears, a threatened species (not endangered), are hard to detect but can be spotted along the Beaufort Sea.

""With regard to the lack of animals, he appears to be very uninformed,"" Springer said of Weldon. ""There are indeed animals, and a lot of them.""

And that’s just those on the ground. There are a number of rivers, streams and lakes throughout the refuge that are home to fish, which Inupiat (Eskimo) people depend upon for sustenance. Marine life, such as seals and whales, exist in the Arctic Ocean.

""We should give fish their due,"" Payer said.

Our ruling

Weldon acknowledged his overstatement in an interview with PolitiFact Florida but stood by his observations gathered from a congressional trip through the refuge in the 1990s.

""There’s more wildlife in your backyard than that area where they want to drill,"" he said.

We won’t argue with relative statements, but Weldon got it wrong when he said there is no wildlife in ANWR",False Pants on Fire,"June 21, 2012"
"Says ""Oregon is one of only three states that allow the use of gillnets on inland waters.""","
CORRECTION appended: This following has been revised to clarify that rules for keeping native fish, and the number of native fish that can be killed, vary according to run. The details given are for spring chinook. 
  
PolitiFact Oregon enjoys tasty Columbia River spring chinook as much as the next Oregonian, but honestly, we don’t know much about catching them. We suspect many readers don’t either, and yet, this November, we probably will vote on a ballot measure to ban the use of commercial gillnets in the Columbia. An alternative method would be allowed.

Gillnets vary in mesh size and length but generally work by capturing fish by the gills and smothering them. The people opposed to gillnets say it’s outdated, indiscriminate and harms native salmon and steelhead.

And they say Oregon is in the minority when it comes to gillnets. ""Currently, Oregon is one of only three states that allow the use of gillnets on inland waters"" reads a May 30 press release by the Stop Gillnetting Now campaign.

Is Oregon truly that rare? And if so, why? Or were we being snookered by campaign politicking? An administrator with Oregon’s Salmon For All, a group that represents commercial gillnetters, said the number of states that allow commercial gillnetting is much higher, which means Oregon is not so out-of-sync. Who’s right?

We turned to Eric Stachon, spokesman with the stop gillnetting campaign. He acknowledged the number was incorrect but maintained that Oregon remains in the minority. ""Oregon,"" the revised statement reads, ""is one of only a few states left that allows the use of commercial gillnets on rivers and streams.""

We wanted to know where non-tribal commercial gillnetting is allowed. Neither side had a definitive figure. Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife didn’t have one either.

So PolitiFact Oregon started calling around the country. We had delightful chats with state officials. And we found at least 11 states besides Oregon that allow commercial gillnetting.

Like Oregon, the states of Washington, Alaska, North Carolina, Mississippi, Tennessee and Louisiana allow commercial gillnets in inland waters, including rivers. California, Virginia and Maryland allow their use in bays. Alabama allows them in the Gulf of Mexico and Michigan in the Great Lakes.  

Certainly, gillnet use has become more restricted as concerns grow about inadvertently trapping other wildlife. California, as we noted, allows gillnetting in the San Francisco Bay, but campaign proponents point out that in 1990 voters approved a ban on the use of gillnets in coastal waters. And while North Carolina allows gillnets in river, ocean and sound waters, the state moved last month to restrict the use in certain areas.

""The quick answer is yes, we do allow them,"" said David Taylor of North Carolina’s Division of Marine Fisheries, ""and the more complicated answer is, with many restrictions.""

The states of Oregon and Washington issue about 500 permits a year for non-tribal fisheries to use on the Columbia River. Of that, maybe 300 are active. The state agencies decide when and where to allow fishing -- if at all -- for runs of spring chinook, fall chinook, coho, etc. They also determine the types of gillnets allowed. For spring chinook, native fish must be returned to the water, dead, lethargic or alive. Non-tribal fishers are allowed to kill roughly 2 percent native spring chinook among them. (The rules vary for each fish run.)

We’re not going to elaborate on the arguments of the two sides, other than to say that recreational fishers and conservationists insist they don’t want to kill off the commercial fishing industry and the gillnetters insist the recreational industry just wants a greater share of the Columbia River fish action.

Both sides agree that the river is unique. ""You don’t see this kind of large-scale use of gillnets, particularly when you have such a large number of endangered species,"" Stachon said in arguing for the strangeness of gillnets in the Columbia.

Jim Markee, a Salmon For All lobbyist, disagrees with the ""large-scale"" tag, but acknowledges fishing in the river is special, for the people who eat the salmon as well as those who catch the coveted fish for people to eat. 
Our limited research found that states have different management needs. There are some states that don’t depend on commercial fishing so gillnets are not an issue. While not comprehensive, we found that the use of non-tribal commercial gillnets is more widespread than originally cited by the campaign.

Oregon is among at least seven states that allow the use in inland rivers. Other states allow the use in bay, gulf and ocean water",False,"June 14, 2012"
"""We came out against Deepwater and everybody is now paying for [the project] in their electric bills.""","
The controversy over Rhode Island's decision to guarantee $75 million in loans to 38 Studios to develop video games has raised questions about the government's role in promoting various businesses.

When Lisa Blais, a member of the board of directors of Ocean State Tea Party In Action, was asked about the deal on the May 21 edition of WHJJ's ""Helen Glover Show,"" she brought up the state's support of the Deepwater Wind project, which is planning to build wind turbines in the waters off Block Island.

""As you know, we came out against Deepwater,"" Blais said. ""And everybody is now paying for it in their electric bills.""

With the Rhode Island economy in such bad shape and many residents facing financial problems, ""who can afford these extra surcharges on our electric bill,"" she asked, calling the Deepwater project another example of ""crony capitalism.""

Her claim caught our attention because Deepwater is still in the planning stages, years away from completion. We wondered: Are Rhode Islanders really paying for a project that hasn’t been built?

Before we answer that question, here’s some background.

In 2004, the General Assembly passed a law requiring National Grid -- the company that provides electricity and gas to Rhode Island -- to start buying electricity generated from renewable sources, such as wind and solar, even though such sources cost more.

In 2007, when the law took effect, the amount was 3 percent of the power the company purchased, rising incrementally each year. It is now at 6.5 percent, according to David Graves, spokesman for National Grid.

In 2009, the legislature and Gov. Donald Carcieri modified that law, requiring National Grid to actively encourage renewable energy projects; one of them was to be an undersea power line from Block Island to the mainland.

The line would be used to feed cheaper power to the island (currently the island relies on diesel generators for its power). Ultimately, the line would feed excess electricity from the Deepwater turbines to the mainland when the wind is blowing.

In the first phase, there would be five turbines. In the second phase, up to 200 more would be built in federal waters.

National Grid has racked up some legal costs dealing with that power line and those costs are being passed on to consumers as part of a 0.007 cents per kilowatt hour surcharge on their bills. For the typical residential customer -- who uses about 500 kilowatts per month -- that surcharge translates to no more than 3.5 cents per month.

The real cost is going to come when National Grid has to buy the power Deepwater generates.

Initially, National Grid and Deepwater agreed that National Grid would pay no more than 24.4 cents per kilowatt hour for that energy -- but that was still more than two and a half times the cost of buying energy from conventional sources at the time. However, that price would automatically increase by 3.5 percent per year over the next 20 years.

The state Public Utilities Commission overruled the deal on March 30, 2010, saying the price was not ""commercially reasonable"" for Grid's customers.

Carcieri and legislative leaders reacted by passing a law requiring the PUC to rehear the case using different rules and a shortened timetable. It also redefined what was ""commercially reasonable"" and declared that Deepwater's initial Block Island project was ""in the public interest.""

Critics said the changes gave the PUC no choice but to approve the agreement, even though the project was expected to result in consumers paying $409 million to $415 million extra for their power while getting economic benefits worth $129 million (as calculated by the state Economic Development Commission) and the creation of just six permanent jobs.

The PUC approved the agreement by a 2-1 vote on Aug. 11, 2010.

How much extra will the power from Deepwater Wind ultimately cost consumers?

On an individual basis, Graves said, the best estimate in 2009 was that the typical residential bill would rise by $1.37 per month. The actual amount will depend on prices at the time. To put that number in context, the bill for the average customer is currently $78 a month.

But the costs will show up in other ways as well, as businesses struggle with more-expensive electricity, an effect that will ripple through the Rhode Island economy. Benefits, such as cleaner energy, are even harder to quantify.

Our ruling

Lisa Blais of the Ocean State Tea Party In Action said that, in the wake of the state's approval of the Deepwater Wind project, ""everybody is now paying for it in their electric bills.""

When we asked for the source of her information, she said she remembered it from the debate over Deepwater, but said she should have referred to the extra cost as something consumers will be facing.

""I would have been more precise if I said now 'we face' paying for it, which was the tenor of my comments on Glover's show,"" she said.

If the Deepwater Wind project becomes operational and if prices for purchasing electricity don't change significantly, Blais' statement could become true.

But most radio listeners would have heard what we did: that we're paying for the project now.

In the strictest sense, we're paying less than 3.5 cents a month for some incidental National Grid expenses connected with the project",False,"June 3, 2012"
"Says he fought for the repeal of a septic tank inspection program after ""Tallahassee pulled a fast one.""","
Florida’s next Senate president is telling voters in a new campaign ad that he fought to overturn a ""fast one"" pulled by Tallahassee lawmakers. 
""When Tallahassee pulled a fast one on septic tanks, Gaetz fought back,"" a TV advertisement says. 
That’s partially true.

But Sen. Don Gaetz, a loquacious Republican from the Panhandle, is leaving something out when he discusses a never-enforced and now largely repealed measure requiring septic tank inspections every five years.

He voted for the inspections. Twice.

In an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Gaetz said he was misled about the inspection requirement by the Senate sponsor and a staff member, and that’s why he and other Republicans crusaded to have the inspection requirement tossed out of state law. But the public record doesn’t bear that out.

""This bill was not a last-minute, surprise bill,"" said Sen. Paula Dockery, R-Lakeland, a member of the special committee that raised the prospect of mandatory inspections with residents in 2010. ""I think that’s a little unfair -- a lot unfair.""

PolitiFact Florida decided to dig into the septic tank inspection requirement, which passed in 2010 and was removed for most counties in 2012.

Then-Sen. Lee Constantine, R-Altamonte Springs, sponsored the measure as part of a larger conservation proposal (SB 550). There are about 2.6 million septic tanks in Florida, and about half are more than 30 years old, a 2008 Department of Health study found. (The Legislature had directed the agency to assess the costs of a statewide inspection program.)

Officials expected the amount of annual septic tank inspections to increase from 17,000 to 500,000 because the of the new requirement.

Constantine’s bill passed its required committees with ease, earning just a few no votes. Gaetz, elected to the Senate in 2006, voted against the bill during one committee stop. But when it came before the full Senate for final passage, Gaetz, like nearly every senator, cast floor votes in favor on April 26, 2010 (30-3), and April 29, 2010 (34-4).

Most people who spoke at the committee’s statewide hearings before the session ""spoke highly of the idea"" of an inspection program, noted a 2010 summary of the committee’s work.

""Not one speaker spoke against requiring inspections,"" the report stated.

That changed almost immediately -- with Gaetz, other Republicans and at least one Democrat leading the backpedaling. They argued that the inspection requirement was a one-size-fits-all approach and that the price tag of inspections -- estimated around $150 or more -- was too high during an economic downturn. (PolitiFact Florida wrote about the cost issue during the 2011 session.)

As frustration mounted among tea party members and his northwest Florida constituents, Gaetz was quoted as saying a repeal of the inspection requirement was already ""teed up and and ready to go,"" according to November 2010 Bradenton Herald story.

In another statement, he bemoaned the legislation’s burden ""on many people in rural areas who are struggling to make it financially in these exceptionally hard times.""

Why the change of heart?

Gaetz told PolitiFact Florida he voted for the bill after being ""misled"" by Constantine and committee staff about the bill’s consequences -- hence the ""fast one.""

He asked Constantine privately outside the Senate chamber, he said, if this was the same proposal the Senate defeated the year before, and he said no (that proposal applied to some counties with larger springs and died in committee). Gaetz said he asked if he had anything to worry about, and Constantine told him no, it would affect areas Gaetz didn’t represent.

""Constantine and the staff director attempted to reassure me and other senators that our concerns were misplaced,"" he said. ""The whole Senate was operating under information that wasn’t entirely true.""

That’s why he crusaded against the inspections later, he said.

Constantine insists he never misrepresented the septic tank program.

""All the information was fully vested,"" Constantine said.

Audio recordings of meetings in which Gaetz voted on SB 550 amplify Constantine’s position.

The inspection requirement was added to the bill during the Senate Policy and Steering Committee on Ways and Means. Shortly before Gaetz’s no vote during that meeting, Sen. Joe Negron, R-Stuart, asked Constantine about the inspection program’s impact during a series of rapid-fire hypothetical questions.

""Is this statewide?"" Negron asked.

""Yes,"" Constantine said.

As the Senate approached its floor vote a few days later, Constantine fielded a question from Sen. Rudy Garcia, R-Hialeah: ""Is this the one that has the septic tank language?""

""This is the landmark bill for water resources and it includes that,"" Constantine said.

There were no questions from Gaetz.

Now, it’s true that Gaetz attempted to overturn the inspection requirement. During a special session in 2010, Gaetz sponsored a measure that pushed the program’s implementation date from Jan. 1, 2011, to July 1, 2011. Gov. Rick Scott allowed it to become law without his signature. (The Senate and the House waited until Scott was in office to deliver the bill to the governor for his signature or veto.)

In 2011, Gaetz said he asked Senate budget chairman JD Alexander, R-Lake Wales, to include budget language that would prevent the Department of Health from implementing the requirement for another year.

And in 2012, Gaetz said he asked Senate President Mike Haridopolos to find a way to get rid of the mandate. A partial repeal wound up in a Department of Health reorganization bill (HB 1263), which Scott signed into law. The inspection requirement still exists for 19 counties with large springs, but they are allowed to opt out of the inspection requirement (as Hernando County did in early May.)

In the end, Gaetz basically fought to get rid of a state law that he is partially responsible for. Gaetz says he was misled by ""a fast one,"" but we found no evidence of the bill sponsor downplaying the swath of affected homeowners. Plus Gaetz ultimately is responsible to know what is in a bill he voted on",Mostly False,"May 24, 2012"
"Says the stimulus bill sent tax credits overseas, such as  ""tens of millions of dollars to build traffic lights in China.""","
Is our stimulus money paying for traffic lights on Chinese streets?

A TV ad running in eight states blames President Barack Obama for sending stimulus money overseas while Americans are out of work.

""Tell President Obama, American tax dollars should help American taxpayers,"" the narrator says. Instead, $2.3 billion in tax credits funded jobs in Mexico, Finland and China, the ad claims.

Americans for Prosperity, a group dedicated to ""educating citizens about economic policy"" that works closely with tea party activists and has been funded by the conservative Koch family, released the ad April 26, 2012.

Here’s the string of claims, starting with an image of the president signing a bill:
  
Washington promised to create American jobs. We passed their stimulus. But that's not what happened. Fact: Billions of taxpayer dollars spent on green energy went to jobs in foreign countries. The Obama administration admitted the truth, that $2.3 billion of tax credits went overseas, while millions of Americans can't find a job. $1.2 billion to a solar company that's building a plant in Mexico. Half a billion to an electric car company that created hundreds of jobs in Finland. And tens of millions of dollars to build traffic lights in China. 
We’ve rated two claims from the ad, about stimulus tax credits supposedly funding a plant in Mexico (Pants on Fire) and paying for jobs in Finland (False).  In this fact-check, we’re examining if those tax credits included ""tens of millions of dollars to build traffic lights in China.""

(We've also checked many other exaggerations about the stimulus.)

The ad said its source for the China claim was a Pittsburgh Tribune-Review article, ""Stimulus money pays for street, traffic lights made largely overseas.""

Traffic lights in China 
As the ad’s narrator talks about China, the words, ""Stimulus money pays for street, traffic lights …"" ""in China …"" appear on the screen, over an image of a traffic light that’s slowly layered with the deep red and yellow of the Chinese flag.

The ad was clearly suggesting U.S.-funded lights on Chinese streets. It wasn’t until we pulled up the Tribune-Review article we realized the ad’s claim could be heard another way.

Oh! Lights built in China, for American streets.

But even that clarification didn’t get us to the complete story.

The Tribune-Review article, by Lou Kilzer, a reporter who has won Pulitzer prizes for investigative reporting and public service, digs into grant money — not tax credits, as the ad claimed — awarded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. It says that tens of millions of stimulus dollars went to replace streetlights and traffic lights across the country with energy-efficient versions — ""made mostly in Asia.""

The reason? Certain components of those energy-efficient street and traffic lights, such as light-emitting diodes or LEDs, weren’t available in large enough quantities from U.S. manufacturers back in 2010, so the Energy Department issued a waiver to the Recovery Act’s ""Buy America"" provision for those parts.

The department found such components were manufactured ""almost exclusively in China and Mexico.""

That was February 2010. The Energy Department withdrew its waiver eight months later after at least one manufacturer of LED lights moved some work from Mexico back to the United States. Suddenly, enough parts would be available to satisfy stimulus grant recipients. They’re now once again subject to ""Buy America"" provisions.

But, back to those eight months — could tens of millions of dollars have gone toward building street lights in China?

That’s not clear. But it’s also not proven by the Tribune-Review story, which talks not just about China, but also about Taiwan, Japan and South Korea. (We suspect the admakers chose China to make it sound more outrageous.)

Meanwhile, the companies building the streetlights told the Tribune-Review that ""their products would be better labeled ‘assembled in America’ than ‘made in America.’""

One example: Leotek Electronics USA, based in California. It’s a subsidiary of Taiwanese companies, Kilzer reported. Leotek bought some of its LEDs from Philips Lumileds, an American subsidiary of a Dutch company. More than half of Philips’ manufacturing production capacity is based in China. Note the complex path to a finished streetlight, as described by Kilzer:

• Philips produced the first component, semiconductor wafers, at its San Jose, Calif., plant.
• It shipped the wafers to Singapore, where they were cut into chips and sent to Malaysia.
• Malaysian workers molded them into LED modules.
• Some of those LED packages went to Leotek in Taiwan to be put on circuit boards.
• Boards and streetlight housings got shipped to Leotek’s plant in Milpitas, Calif., where workers combined them with ‘U.S.- and non-U.S.-made components’ for assembly.

Kilzer said Leotek won more than a dozen stimulus street and traffic projects.

We found one such project, for the City of Palo Alto, which paid $355,281 from a stimulus grant to Leotek for LED streetlight fixtures. About 60 percent of its total grant of nearly $640,000 went toward fixtures, including others from GE Lighting and Genlyte Thomas Group. But more than 40 percent was spent on software and consulting services and installation.

So, did some stimulus money end up spent on parts made in China? Yes, according to Kilzer’s reporting and a now-withdrawn Energy Department waiver indicating the parts were available there when they weren’t widely manufactured in the United States.

Did it add up to tens of millions of dollars? Kilzer’s piece talks about that amount of money being spent ""to replace streetlights and traffic lights nationwide,"" and says the new, efficient lights would be made ""mostly in Asia"" — not just China.

It’s not clear whether Kilzer’s number also includes installation, consulting services and other non-fixture expenses — the kind of stuff that consumed 40 percent of Palo Alto’s grant. (We asked him, but didn’t hear back.) It is clear that the ""tens of millions"" reflects spending for American-assembled lights that included varying amounts of foreign-made components. But it's an exaggeration to say they were built in China.

None of this evidence supports the strong suggestion in the ad that Americans paid for streetlights on roads in China, or even that they paid to build streetlights in China. Instead, for less than a year, stimulus funds could be used to buy products that used components produced in other countries, including China.

Our ruling

We watched this ad and imagined Chinese street corners with shiny new American-funded traffic lights.

The reality is nearly the opposite: American cities, counties and states bought and installed new energy-efficient street and traffic lights with stimulus grants. Many of those lights contained foreign components, including some from China, but it’s simply not clear how much stimulus money went toward those parts during the eight months it was allowed.

A second claim, on building traffic lights in China, we rated Mostly False.  In this fact-check, we’re examining if those tax credits included ""half a billion to an electric car company that created hundreds of jobs in Finland.""

(We've also checked many other exaggerations about the stimulus.) 
The ad said its source for the Finland claim was an ABC News article, ""Car Company Gets U.S. Loan, Builds Cars In Finland.""

A loan for U.S. work

The first clue something’s wrong is in that ABC News headline. A car company got a ""U.S. loan."" That’s not the same thing as a tax credit. Taxpayers expect to get loan money back, with interest. (Though, they don’t always. See: Solyndra.)

Things get even more wrong from there.

That U.S. loan program? It's the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program through the Energy Department. And it's not funded by Obama’s stimulus bill — otherwise known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. It is, in fact, a program signed into existence by President George W. Bush in 2007 and first funded by legislation Bush signed in 2008. 

The program was designed to support development of advanced technology vehicles.

The Bush administration was in charge when the automaker filed its application. The Obama administration was in charge when the company’s loan was approved. The stimulus bill had nothing to do with it.

Now, the ad could have raised relevant criticism of the Energy Department’s loan programs. Watchdogs inside and outside government have argued since the Bush administration that the programs haven’t included safeguards sufficient to protect taxpayers. Instead, the ad says stimulus tax credits funded overseas jobs. That’s the claim we’re weighing here. And that’s just not the case.

Fisker Automotive, a U.S. automaker with global headquarters in Anaheim, Calif., got its $529 million federal loan to develop and produce two lines of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles — the Karma and the Nina.

The project was expected to create about 2,000  jobs in Wilmington, Del., where the Nina would be manufactured, according to the Energy Department.

Part of the loan — $169 million — paid for design, engineering and other work in the United States on the Fisker Karma. A larger part — $359 million — was slated to help buy and reconfigure a shuttered General Motors plant in Delaware to build the Nina.

Here’s where Finland enters the story: Before its Energy Department loans were approved, Fisker had decided it would manufacture the Karma at a plant in Finland. The company argued there simply wasn’t a U.S. plant available for the type of car they were building. But 65 percent of the parts for the Karma, based on cost, would come from U.S. suppliers.

""There was no contract manufacturer in the U.S. that could actually produce our vehicle,"" Henrik Fisker, the company's founder, told ABC News. ""They don't exist here.""

The loan for the design of the car ""was only used for the U.S. operations"" and could not be spent overseas, according to  Fisker and the Energy Department.

Meanwhile, most of the loan has yet to be disbursed. Fisker says it stopped taking loan money from the Energy Department in May 2011, after drawing $190 million — most of it for Karma design and development. Its Nina project, now called the Atlantic, has been delayed.

The News Journal in Wilmington, Del., reported the payments to Fisker stopped after the company failed to meet Energy Department milestones set as conditions for the loan. 
""Our loan documents require borrowers to meet certain milestones and other conditions prior to receiving loan proceeds,"" department spokesman Damien LaVera told PolitiFact. ""As has been widely reported, Fisker has experienced some delays in its sales and production schedule -- which is common for start-ups. 
""As Fisker works through those issues and incorporates lessons learned from the production of the Karma, the department is working with Fisker to review a revised business plan and determine the best path forward so the company can meet its benchmarks, produce cars and employ workers here in America."" 
That makes it an open question when the Delaware plant will produce Fisker autos. As of April, it only employed a small maintenance team. In the meantime, it's not getting loan money. 
Our ruling

An ad from Americans for Prosperity starts with an image of Obama and says the stimulus bill sent tax credits overseas, such as ""half a billion to an electric car company that created hundreds of jobs in Finland.""

The reality: Half a billion in loans from a Bush-era program were approved for Fisker Automotive. But they weren’t tax credits, weren’t part of the stimulus bill, and didn’t go to Finland. And so far, the company has only gotten $190 million in those loans, far less than the half a billion.

Instead, the U.S. company spent a third of the money on U.S. engineering of a new electric vehicle. It chose to manufacture the car in Finland, without U.S. help. Another two-thirds of the loan, which it may or may not get, will go toward retooling a shuttered GM plant in Delaware.

Sounds like a scandal and an outrage. Is that what happened? 
For this fact-check, we’re focusing on whether ""tax credits"" that ""went overseas"" included ""$1.2 billion to a solar company that's building a plant in Mexico."" (In other fact-checks, we found the Finland claim False, and the China claim Mostly False.)

The ad listed two sources for its Mexico claim, the Energy Department and PV Magazine. We tracked those down, then chatted with the companies involved.

Two programs, two projects

We’ll start with what’s true: An American solar company, SunPower, was approved for federal stimulus money. It also opened a solar panel plant in Mexico.

(Or, rather, it moved its Mexican manufacturing from Chihuahua to a building it’s leasing in Mexicali, said company spokeswoman Natalie Wymer.)

That’s where the claim’s relationship to the truth ends.

• The company didn’t get tax credits, but a $1.2 billion loan guarantee. What’s the difference? The Energy Department expects the loan to be paid back — with interest.

• That loan guarantee wasn’t for the Mexico plant — a separate project with its own funding — but to build the California Valley Solar Ranch in San Luis Obispo, Calif. Construction on the California project has already started, with the Energy Department projecting 350 construction jobs and 15 permanent ones. Pacific Gas & Electric Co., the state’s largest utility, will ultimately buy the power.

• Most of the solar panels for the California project will come from SunPower’s California manufacturing facility in Milpitas, though given the size of the project, they’ll also come from the company’s plants in Mexico and Asia, Wymer said.

• SunPower no longer owns the California Valley Solar Ranch project. The solar project — and the loan guarantee — belong to New Jersey company NRG Energy. That’s the company that will get the federal loan money, and be responsible for repaying taxpayers.

Our ruling

A TV ad from Americans for Prosperity says billions of tax dollars spent on green energy went to jobs in foreign countries. It claims that stimulus bill tax credits went overseas, such as ""$1.2 billion to a solar company that's building a plant in Mexico."" The ad even cites sources for its claim.

But those same sources, plus a few phone calls, quickly bring down the ad’s house of cards. Sure, taxpayer money was originally approved for a California solar company that also happened to open a plant in Mexico. But that loan — not tax credits, as the ad claims — will go to a New Jersey company for a solar project in California, employing construction workers in the state, using mostly California-built solar panels, to create solar power that’ll be purchased by a California utility.

That’s a completely different story. The ad strings together alarming-sounding tidbits about actual stimulus projects to create the impression of something else entirely — in a way that’s ultimately ridiculous",False Pants on Fire,"May 2, 2012"
President Obama's refusal to grant permits for offshore drilling is one reason gasoline prices are soaring.,"A robocall we received last week, recorded by Fox News host and former Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, claims that President Obama’s refusal to grant permits for offshore drilling is a key reason why gasoline prices have been rising.

Huckabee says the call is on behalf of the conservative group Presidential Coalition. In it, he claims ""the potential for $5- or $6-a-gallon gasoline this year terrifies Barack Obama, and it's an issue that we can lay directly on his doorstep. Obama's veto of the Keystone pipeline, his refusal to drill in Alaska or grant permits for offshore drilling, his cozying up to the Middle East and weakness on the energy issue, that's the reason gas prices are soaring, and don't let anyone tell you different.""

First, Obama never vetoed the pipeline, which originally had a route that was opposed by Nebraska's governor, a Republican; it has never come to his desk for a signature. Obama expressed opposition to a Republican bill designed to push it through without going through the normal approval process.

But we were more interested in checking one of the other key parts of Huckabee’s claim -- that the president had refused to grant permits for offshore drilling.

That claim has been around for a while. In March 2011, Rep. Michele Bachmann, also a Republican, reported that only one new oil drilling permit had been issued since Obama took office.

That statement earned her a Pants on Fire from PolitiFact National in part because Bachmann made her statement 15 days after Obama reported at a news conference that more than 35 new offshore drilling permits had been approved. (A moratorium on permits had been imposed to implement new safety and environmental standards in the wake of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.)

To get the latest count for the Gulf of Mexico, we turned to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, BSEE.gov.

Since new shallow water well regulations were put into effect June 8, 2010, the bureau reports, 122 permits for drilling where the water depth is 500 feet or less have been approved.

New regulations for deep-water wells took effect Oct. 12, 2010. Since then, 167 have been  permitted by the Obama administration. BSEE spokeswoman Eileen Angelico said 27 of those permits were for existing wells where drilling was suspended during the moratorium.

That leaves 140 new deep-water wells just in the Gulf of Mexico.

In fact, federal authorities have also approved two other drilling permits -- for wells off the Alaska coast.

Our ruling

Mike Huckabee is telling people who receive his robocall that Obama has refused to issue offshore drilling permits -- one reason, he says, why gasoline prices are soaring.

In fact, 140 permits for new deep-water wells have been issued since the massive Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010. More than hundred shallow water permits have also been issued since the moratorium was lifted, but we didn't ask how many of those were new because it is clear, just from the deep-water data, that Huckabee's claim is bogus.

""Don't let anyone tell you different,"" Huckabee says in his robocall as he faults the president for not approving new wells.

"Sherrod Brown opposed blocking a new EPA emissions rule, ""despite acknowledging that the EPA's cap-and-trade regulations are ‘burdensome’ and could harm economic growth in Ohio.""","
Sometimes in politics, a string of independent facts and impressive words can be thrown together to reach a negative or menacing conclusion. One or more of the facts might even be true in a speculative context, even if they don’t add up when put together. There is an art to this, and it can be a beautiful thing.

Such a claim crossed PolitiFact Ohio’s desk recently, and on its face it seemed plausible.

The claim, from U.S. Senate candidate Josh Mandel, was in response to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s announcement on March 27 that it was severely restricting greenhouse gas emissions from new power plants. Mandel, a Republican, is Ohio’s treasurer and hopes to unseat Democratic incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown.

In a news release on March 29, Mandel’s campaign used the EPA announcement to say that ""Senator Sherrod Brown voted against an amendment to block the EPA from implementing this new rule, despite acknowledging that the EPA's cap-and-trade regulations are ‘burdensome’ and could harm economic growth in Ohio.""

The harm to Ohio was this, said Mandel’s communications director, Travis Considine, who issued the news release: ""According to the Sierra Club, these cap-and-trade regulations will ultimately put an end to coal fired power plants. This policy change would have a particularly negative effect on Ohio energy rates, because coal accounts for 86 percent of Ohio's energy supply.""

It does sound bad, and being somewhat familiar with the ongoing battle over power plant regulation, PolitiFact Ohio wanted to learn more. We asked Considine for additional information, and asked Brown’s Senate office to respond. We also did some independent reporting.

Mandel’s claim began to fall apart pretty quickly.

Let’s start with some quick background. After years of disputes between the EPA, environmental groups, the utility industry and states, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that Congress gave the EPA the authority to determine whether greenhouse gases contribute to climate change and, if so, the responsibility to regulate it. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas produced when, among other things, power plants burn coal to create electricity.

The ruling prompted all parties to get to work. The EPA started working on proposed regulations, while the coal industry, many in the utility industry, skeptics of global warming and some politicians started working on ways to curtail the EPA’s power. The fight was particularly germane to Ohio because coal is the state’s primary fuel source for power plants.

The prospect of EPA regulation created difficult choices for Midwest Democrats, who generally were allied with environmentalists but also knew of potential negative economic effects on their states. Brown on Feb. 28, 2011, wrote to President Barack Obama to warn of ""potential unintended consequences"" of greenhouse gas regulations. He said that ""industries, workers, and farmers are extremely concerned that burdensome permitting requirements have been triggered for greenhouse gas emissions.""

Five weeks later, as the EPA was still working on potential coal rules, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the top Republican in the Senate, sponsored an amendment to strip the EPA of its power to regulate greenhouse gases. Although the amendment got 50 votes, that was insufficient for passage under Senate rules. Brown voted against the amendment while Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman voted for it.

But another vote came up that day, this one on an amendment sponsored by Michigan Democrat Debbie Stabenow, with Brown as a cosponsor. It would have required the EPA to wait two years before implementing greenhouse gas limits. Stabenow and Brown also wanted the White House to provide more financial and technical assistance to power plants and factories to cushion any blow from new coal rules.

This amendment failed too, getting only seven votes. Brown took criticism from the Wall Street Journal editorial page, which supported McConnell’s amendment and said that several competing amendments to delay, including the one by Stabenow and Brown, were merely ""phony"" alternatives to give a few Democrats political cover. Yet Brown was also criticized by a group of environmentalists, saying that by voting to delay greenhouse gas regulations, he was weakening the Clean Air Act.

And so the EPA began regulating, issuing its first ever national standard on greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants on March 27. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said that new plants could release no more than 1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour. This is a tough new standard, one that no commercially viable technology can currently handle, critics said. Power plants that use natural gas, however, can comply easily.

The EPA maintained that coal still provides for half of this country’s electricity needs, that new technology could be available soon to allow future coal plants to comply, and that no existing plants, or those under construction, will be affected by the new rule.  But Jeff Holmstead, a former EPA air regulator, told Environment & Energy Publishing (E&E) in an interview, ""I think everyone who's being honest agrees that it effectively bans new coal-fired power plants.""

Or, as Sierra Club executive director Michael Brune told Bloomberg, the EPA rule ""captures the end of an era.""

Yet Brune also noted what others have said as well: The domestic market was moving away from coal already.

In fact, no new coal-fired power plants are being planned in the United States, a decision that predated the EPA’s announcement. The price and efficiency of natural gas, and its apparent abundance in recent shale finds, has made new coal-power plants a foolish investment.

""We are not planning to build any coal-fired plants at the time,"" FirstEnergy spokesman Mark Durbin confirmed to PolitiFact Ohio.

American Electric Power, a large Columbus-based company, has a coal-fired plant under construction in Arkansas, but the new EPA rule only affects plants that are more than a year away from getting their construction permits. Power usage is down in general because of the economy, but industry officials say that any new needs should be handled far more cost-effectively with natural gas.

""We have nothing else planned in the way of coal-fire generation,"" AEP spkesman Pat Hemlepp told us.

The EPA has no plans to issue carbon rules for existing plants, the agency’s director told reporters on a conference call after announcing the rule for new plants. If that changes, she said, it would be after extensive consultation with all parties, including utilities.

So the new rule that Mandel complained about -- the one for which he criticized Brown and predicted economic harm for Ohioans -- will have no known effect in Ohio.

Skeptics suggest that President Barack Obama’s administration could ramp up more regulations after the election. The coal industry and some Republicans point to other recent regulations that are not specifically related to greenhouse gases, such as an EPA rule in late 2011 limiting emissions of mercury and other poisonous metals. This rule prompted some utilities to announce they will shut down some of their older, less-efficient coal-burning units rather than spend money scrubbing mercury and arsenic. It took the EPA 20 years to issue the mercury rule, and the agency is giving companies at least three years to comply.

With all of these coal restrictions, regardless of what’s being emitted and which rule it falls under, what will happen if natural gas proves to be less abundant than expected, or if its price rises dramatically? This is being asked by the coal industry and its supporters.

""Volatile natural gas prices will, once again, expose millions of households to higher utility bills, threaten hundreds of thousands of workers with unemployment and weaken both the competitiveness of basic industries and the reliability of the nation’s electricity grid,"" warned Hal Quinn, president and CEO of the National Mining Association.
.
Portman, the Ohio Republican, emailed a statement to Bloomberg after the EPA released its new coal rule, saying, ""The uncertainty caused by these regulations could result in the loss of thousands of Ohio jobs and will increase electricity rates for families during tough economic times, in return for less reliable power.""

That is possible. But no one is projecting that. The skepticism is speculative, and multi-billion-dollar corporations that have the most at stake are investing in natural gas. They were moving away from coal, regardless of its abundance, before the EPA’s newest announcement.

We were curious as to why Mandel’s campaigned use the words ""cap and trade."" Cap and trade refers to a proposed system of emission limits and credits; if a company wanted to emit more carbon, it would have to buy excess credits from another company that had already reduced its emissions. This would set up a system that merges free-market ideas with government regulation. But Congress could never agree on those caps, so there is no cap-and-trade system. Considine, Mandel’s spokesman, acknowledged as much.

That’s a minor point, but it is helpful to know since Mandel used the term.

The bottom line here is that Mandel said: ""Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) voted against an amendment to block the EPA from implementing this new rule, despite acknowledging that the EPA's cap-and-trade regulations are ‘burdensome’ and could harm economic growth in Ohio.""

It is true that Brown voted against an amendment to strip the EPA of its power to regulate greenhouse gases. But the rest of the claim is inaccurate and invokes issues that don’t exist in reality",False Pants on Fire,"April 5, 2012"
"""Obama opposed exploring for energy in Alaska.""","
Bearing the bold title ""Nine Dollar Gas,"" a new ad by the American Energy Alliance attacks President Barack Obama’s energy policies and blames him for high gasoline prices.

It mentions the solar technology company Solyndra and the controversial Keystone oil pipeline, two issues with a tenuous-at-best relationship to what we’re currently paying at the pump.

The ad, released March 27, 2012, also says this: ""Obama opposed exploring for energy in Alaska.""

That’s the claim we’ll check here.

Source of the claim

On the screen beneath the Alaska claim is a citation for an Associated Press story dated Feb. 17, 2012. A spokesman for the American Energy Alliance, a conservative group tied to the industry-funded Institute for Energy Research, sent us a link to the story headlined ""House passes drilling-friendly energy package.""

The story was about a House plan to expand oil and gas drilling that was included in a $260 billion transportation bill.

""The legislation, which 21 Republicans voted against and 21 Democrats voted for, would open the eastern Gulf of Mexico off Florida and areas off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts to drilling, lift a ban on drilling in a small portion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and order leases to be offered for Western oil shale,"" the story said.

""Obama has said he would not pursue drilling off the Pacific and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and has pushed back offering leases in the Atlantic until at least 2017,"" it continued.

The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is an area about the size of South Carolina managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service to preserve habitat and protect birds, plants and animals such as caribou, polar bears and gray wolves.

While Obama has resisted efforts to drill for oil in the refuge, we found another Associated Press story dated the same day that clears the way for other drilling in the 49th state.

Under the headline ""With Obama's OK, Shell may soon start drilling for oil in arctic,"" the story said the White House had okayed Shell’s response plan for dealing with a spill in the Chukchi Sea, off Alaska's northwest coast, an important step before drilling can go forward. The company, which called the plan’s approval a ""major milestone,"" said it hopes to drill up to three wells there during the summer of 2012. It also plans two wells in the Beaufort Sea, off the northern coast. Shell’s disaster response plan for that area won approval in March.

The moves angered some environmentalists and native Alaskan groups, who questioned Shell’s claim in the Chukchi Sea plan that it would be able to clean up nearly all oil in the event of a spill. But Obama’s interior secretary, Ken Salazar, said any exploration in Alaska would be done ""under the strongest oversight, safety requirements and emergency response plans ever established,"" according to the AP story.

Our ruling

The American Energy Alliance ad said that Obama ""opposed exploring for energy in Alaska.""

That’s a narrow slice of reality. It’s true that the president opposes opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration, but the administration has approved plans that allow for expanded drilling in other parts of Alaska, including clearing a process that could let Shell sink new rigs in two Alaskan offshore areas as soon as summer 2012.

The ad leaves out that significant piece of the picture",Half True,"April 2, 2012"
"""Every time the weight of that vehicle is reduced by a hundred pounds, your chances of dying are going to go up by about 5 percent. Peel three hundred pounds off – you’re 15 percent more likely to die in that car.""","Talk-radio host Lars Larson went after President Barack Obama in a news post recently, claiming that the White House’s attempts to increase vehicle fuel mileage will end up killing some of us. The post is tantalizingly called, ""Obama is going to kill some of you.""

How will that happen? Well, Larson says, the auto industry will do whatever it takes to stay in business, including making cars ""very, very small."" This is how Larson explains it:
  ""They’re going to peel hundreds and hundreds of pounds of weight off the cars that you drive to achieve the government ordered corporate average fuel economy, even though America is sitting on an ocean of available oil. Every time the weight of that vehicle is reduced by a hundred pounds, your chances of dying are going to go up by about 5 percent. Peel three hundred pounds off – you’re 15 percent more likely to die in that car."" 
We need to back up here. The Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, regulations are intended to improve the fuel economy of vehicles so we don’t guzzle so much oil. Obama  announced last year a goal of an average 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. The fleet average today is about 27 miles per gallon.

Conservatives tend to argue that automakers will respond by making cars lighter and, therefore, more dangerous. But it’s important to note that the regulations set different goals for vehicles based on type. In other words, large sports utility vehicles don’t have to meet the same mileage goal as compact cars.

That’s the backdrop. We turned to Larson.

He cited a 2003 study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which found that a 100-pound reduction in smaller cars resulted in a 4.39 percent increase in fatalities. The study looked at fatality data from 1995 to 2000, involving 1991 to 1999 model vehicles. Let us emphasize, the statistic applied only to vehicles weighing less than 2,950 pounds -- not all vehicles. For larger vehicles, the increase was about 2 percent. (What’s a car in the higher-risk category? A 1995 Honda Accord LX is about 2,900 lbs.)

So the statistic exists, but we wondered: Surely vehicles have come a long way since 1999?

We turned to a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Transportation, who forwarded us an updated version of the 2003 study with new numbers.

And guess what? The 2011 study shows that for lighter cars weighing less than 3,106 lbs, the chances of dying go up 1.44 percent for every 100-pound reduction, if you maintain the same vehicle size or ""footprint"" as they call it.

That’s a much smaller difference.

Tom Wenzel is a research scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory who also studies vehicle size, weight and fatality statistics. He explained the differences in the two studies.

One, he said, the 2003 study assumed weight reduction would be accompanied by size reduction, but that’s not necessarily the case. Two, he said, vehicles have quite simply changed in the last decade, to become safer without the added weight. The later study looked at vehicles made between 2000 and 2007.

The 4.39 percent figure is one statistic at one point in time, Wenzel said. Tweak the factors that go into the model to get that figure and the numbers change.

NHTSA acknowledges the variety of opinions. At a one-day workshop on the topic of mass, size and safety the agency’s deputy administrator said that researchers have come to different conclusions: ""Some associated a significant fatality increase with mass reductions, while others associated a fatality decrease with mass reduction.""

Finally, we checked with the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Spokesman Russ Rader generally agrees that larger is safer. ""All cars are much safer than they used to be, but the laws of physics haven’t been repealed,"" he said. ""So the differences are still there: that is, people riding in small, lightweight cars get less protection in crashes than people in bigger, heavier ones.""

He pointed to a 2010 analysis of driver death rates per million showing that mini-cars, like the Honda Fit, had a death rate of 70 per million registered vehicles of that size. That’s double the rate for very large cars, 32 per million. And, sure, that makes sense.

But, we’d be remiss if we didn’t point out in the same chart that midsize cars, like the Honda Accord, had a death rate of 37 per million -- which is close to the largest cars. (Rader’s response? Midsize cars do a good job, too.)

We wanted to give a variety of sources and opinions, but we have a ruling to make.

Larson cited a study figure that was largely accurate in 2003, but only as applied to vehicles under a certain weight. And those numbers have been updated by the original researcher to reflect a much smaller increase that is significantly different from Larson’s statement.

Larson argues that his statement is accurate. His point remains that increasing fuel mileage -- from the mid-20s to 55 miles per gallon by 2025 -- will have to come from reducing weight and technical advancements, but he thinks it’s more of the former rather than the latter.  

""Reducing weight degrades safety. I told the listener that it makes death or injury more likely,"" he wrote in an email.

Researchers and others in the industry are somewhat divided on how much weight to give weight in calculating safety, but they acknowledge that Obama is not demanding that all of us start driving Honda Fits.

"The RESTORE Act started as an ""effort to dedicate as much BP fine money as possible towards Gulf Coast restoration"" but now ""could steer money to places like the Great Lakes and West Coast.""","
A year after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Florida’s two senators -- Republican Marco Rubio and Democrat Bill Nelson -- joined forces to support the RESTORE Act, a bipartisan effort to direct money from BP fines to Florida and other Gulf states affected by the 2010 oil spill.

But when the bill reached the Senate floor March 8 for a key vote, Rubio voted ""no.""

Why the change of heart?

Rubio said the bill that passed the Senate was ""far different"" than the one he supported in July.

""What started as a genuine bipartisan effort to dedicate as much BP fine money as possible towards Gulf Coast restoration has now turned into a raw deal that increases taxes, creates a new environmental bureaucracy, and could steer money to places like the Great Lakes and West Coast that had nothing to do with the oil spill,"" Rubio said.

""This is no longer a Gulf Coast restoration bill, it’s a federal power grab that exploits the BP spill to pay for special interest projects driven by the usual 'what's in it for me' Washington mentality,"" he said. ""I will not support raising taxes to pay for BP’s mess or to pay for new spending projects across the country that have nothing to do with Gulf Coast restoration.""

Rubio’s vote attracted attention because he was the only Gulf Coast senator to oppose the bill, and because a poll showed the vast majority of Floridians -- including Republicans and tea party supporters -- were in favor of the RESTORE Act.

Was Rubio correct to imply that states such as Michigan or California could get money related to the oil spill across the country? We decided to check it out.

The RESTORE Act

The RESTORE Act stands for the Resources and Ecosystems Sustainability, Tourism Opportunities and Revived Economies. It was introduced in July 2011 by Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., and was cosponsored by Rubio, Nelson and other senators.

The legislation directs 80 percent of the fines in connection with the Deepwater Horizon explosion to go to Gulf Coast projects, and the remainder to the U.S. Treasury. In the Gulf, the money could be used for mitigating damage to wildlife, monitoring fisheries, promoting tourism and job creation. The fines could hit $20 billion.

On Sept. 21, the Senate’s committee on Environment and Public Works agreed to add an amendment that would create the National Endowment for the Oceans, a separate project which had stalled after being proposed in July 2010. Rubio is not a member of that committee.

As the title suggests, the endowment is a national program with money available for coastal areas including -- you guessed it -- the Great Lakes and West Coast among other places.

Environmentalists applauded that addition.

""We had the largest ecosystem damaging disaster we ever had,"" said Brian Moore, legislative director at National Audubon. ""Wouldn’t it be a good idea to divert a small portion of that to study the health of all our oceans and large bodies of water?""

That ""small portion"" for the ocean endowment refers to half of the interest from the oil spill fine, not the fine itself. It’s impossible to predict what portion could go to the Great Lakes or West Coast, said Emily Woglom, director of government relations at the Ocean Conservancy.

""It will be driven by merits of proposals, and regardless, we are likely talking about millions of dollars for ocean endowment as compared to billions of dollars for the gulf restoration fund,"" she said.

The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the RESTORE Act could fund an endowment of $138 million by 2021 for both the ocean endowment and the Gulf of Mexico.

On Feb. 15, 2012, Nelson submitted an amendment to the transportation bill in the Senate that included the version of the RESTORE Act with the oceans provision. Rubio was a cosponsor.

On March 7, Nelson submitted the amendment again, but Rubio was no longer a cosponsor. On March 8, the Senate passed the amendment 76-22, prompting Rubio’s protest. The Senate passed the full transportation bill March 14 again by 76-22 with Rubio again voting ""no.""

Rubio’s ""no"" vote on the RESTORE Act puzzled some its supporters: Why didn’t he speak up publicly earlier?

Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said that on the original bill that ""we made clear on a staff level that Sen. Rubio wouldn’t support the National Endowment for Oceans. … We were hoping the final bill would not include that and (Rubio would) be able to support it.""

The ocean endowment wasn’t the only part that bothered Rubio. He explained his vote in more detail in an editorial, and he included criticism of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, an existing fund that uses fees from oil and gas leasing in federal waters to purchase and protect land. Language was added to the RESTORE Act to allow the conservation fund to get a boost in money.

Woglom of the Ocean Conservancy said that technically the conservation fund isn’t getting BP fine money, but that the RESTORE Act and the Conservation Fund are sharing an offset to cover the increase in spending. Under pay-go budget rules, any change has to be accounted as new spending even if it comes from fines, and therefore needs an offset.

The offset comes out of money generated by a delay in an interest rate adjustment for business investment. Anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist called that a tax increase. Rubio signed Norquist’s tax pledge in 2009, and if Rubio had voted for the RESTORE Act, Norquist could make the case that Rubio had violated his pledge.

Moore, who favors the Land and Conservation Fund, said that isn’t a tax increase -- it extends an existing statute that makes businesses that make a profit overseas continue to pay a tax.

RESTORE had not made it into law as of March 20, 2012, because the House had not passed a full transportation bill. The House version of RESTORE doesn’t include the oceans endowment, so the two chambers will need to resolve their differences.

Our ruling 
Rubio said the RESTORE Act started as an ""effort to dedicate as much BP fine money as possible towards Gulf Coast restoration"" but now ""could steer money to places like the Great Lakes and West Coast."" It's not the fine money itself that could go to other bodies of water, but interest from the fines. Half the interest could go to an ocean endowment for coastal regions nationwide, including the Great Lakes and West Coast. The bulk of the fines themselves will still go to the Gulf Coast. The small amount was set aside to attract votes from non-Gulf senators. 
And in fact, the legislation passed the Senate by a wide enough margin to guarantee that Rubio’s home state will get the money and still allow him to say he voted against tax increases.

Publicly, Rubio was quiet about the provision to protect other bodies of water for months, though we are rating him here on the truthfulness of his words, not the timing of his protest. Some money from the RESTORE Act could go to the Great Lakes and the West Coast, but the bulk of the money -- particularly the fines themselves -- would still go to the Gulf Coast",Half True,"March 22, 2012"
Says Lake Erie contains more native fish than all the other Great Lakes combined.,"
With a newly reconfigured congressional district that stretches along Lake Erie between Toledo and Cleveland, it’s not surprising that U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur would be one of Lake Erie’s biggest boosters.

Late last month, the Toledo Democrat  marked Great Lakes Week on Capitol Hill with a speech on the House of Representatives floor that discussed the need to prevent voracious Asian carp from entering the Great Lakes and threatening its $7 billion fishing industry. She declared that no lake is more important than Lake Erie, noting that it has the Great Lakes’ largest fishery.

Lake Erie ""contains more native fish than all the other lakes combined,"" Kaptur said. ""We must protect this valuable ecological treasure, and the local multi-billion dollar economy it supports.""

Kaptur’s boast about Lake Erie containing ""more native fish than all the other lakes combined"" sounded like it might be a fish story, so PolitiFact Ohio decided to check it out.

We consulted Ohio Sea Grant College Program Director Jeffrey M. Reutter, an expert on Lake Erie. He said Kaptur’s statement is largely correct, although there are caveats. He said that Lake Erie always produces more fish than any of the other Great Lakes, and invariably outstrips Lakes Ontario, Huron and Superior combined. Occasionally Lake Michigan produces enough fish so that its total, when added to the other three, exceeds the total produced by Lake Erie. He also said that some of the fish that populate the lakes - such as common carp, as well as salmon and trout that have been stocked in Lakes Michigan and Huron, are not native species.

""The point I am a little unsure of is the native vs. non-native portion,"" he said. ""That is a hard one to state accurately because, for example, the common carp, which is very abundant just about everywhere, is not technically a native species and the large salmonid fishery on Lake Michigan is not native.""

He said that Lake Superior contains 40 to 50 percent of the water in the Great Lakes, but just 2 percent of the fish. Lake Erie contains just 2 percent of the water, and 50 percent of the fish. He said Lake Erie produces more fish than the other lakes because it is the farthest south, the shallowest, and therefore the warmest lake. Lake Erie also is surrounded by farms and urban residential areas that stream nutrients into its waters. The nutrients feed algae and zooplankton, which feed Lake Erie’s fish. Lake Superior is deeper, colder, and is largely surrounded by forests, so it gets fewer nutrients produced by human intervention and produces fewer fish.

""Personally, I would say that she is arguably correct in her statement and let it go,"" said Reutter. ""Congresswoman Kaptur has heard me speak on Lake Erie many times and I am sure she is attempting to accurately repeat something she has heard from me. I would say it’s close enough to be OK.""

Ohio Department of Natural Resources fisheries biology supervisor Jeff Tyson confirmed Reutter’s observations, noting that the sport and commercial walleye and yellow perch fisheries in Lake Erie far exceed the harvestable fish in the other lakes. White bass, white perch, rainbow smelt, freshwater drum and channel catfish are also found in Lake Erie.

Tyson noted that isolated specimens of the Asian carp that Kaptur fears could devastate the Great Lakes have already been found in Lake Erie, most recently in 2003. He said those fish were probably put into its waters  as part of a tradition among Asians, in which two live fish are purchased, and one is eaten and the other is released for good luck.

""We think these were isolated incidents and have no evidence of an established population,"" said Tyson.

Tyson said that Asian carp eat huge amounts of the same plankton consumed by larval walleye, so their introduction would hurt the walleye’s ability to compete.

A Michigan Sea Grant Extension study of Great Lakes Commercial Fisheries bears out Kaptur’s contention that Lake Erie produces more fish than the other lakes combined, although it did not break out native vs. non-native species. In the year it examined - 2000 - it  found that the Great Lakes produced 46.7 million pounds of fish. Of that total, 26.1 million pounds came from Lake Erie, about 56 percent of the total. Lake Erie’s haul included roughly 7 million pounds each of walleye and smelt, 4.4 million pounds of yellow perch, 3.4 million pounds of white bass, and more than a million pounds each of carp and lake whitefish.

The Great Lakes Fishery Commission also keeps data on the amount of fish produced in each of the Great Lakes. In 2005, the most recent year for which complete data is posted on its website, Lake Erie’s fish production exceeded that of the combined other lakes by a 3-to-2 margin.

There’s no doubt that Kaptur is correct in her overall point that Lake Erie has by far the most productive fishery on the Great Lakes. Her contention that Lake Erie contains more native fish than the other lakes combined is slightly problematic. It’s true that the fishing haul in Lake Erie usually exceeds the combined total of the other lakes. But some fish that are commercial staples in the Great Lakes are not considered ""native"" because they were introduced from other areas, although their presence isn’t as unwelcome and devastating as invaders like zebra mussels have been, and Asian carp would be",Mostly True,"March 22, 2012"
"The Atlanta area’s water planning district ""is now the national leader in conservation.""","
Atlanta may be known as the capital of the South. Or for its place in civil rights history. Or for the fact that an alarming number of its road names include the word ""peachtree.""   

Now a local water official thinks the metro area deserves another claim to fame: leader in water conservation.

Pat Stevens is chief of the Environmental Planning Division of the Atlanta Regional Commission, which staffs the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District. This district manages the region’s water supply.

Stevens told a group of business leaders that the planning district is outpacing even California, which has earned national attention for its water conservation efforts.

""The Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District is now the national leader in conservation,"" Stevens told the crowd, according to a Jan. 24 story on AccessNorthGa.com.

""We have out-California'ed California,"" Stevens said.

We were curious. Since when was this region a leader in water conservation?

Water is a precious commodity in Georgia, so much so that the state has been battling Alabama and Florida in federal court for water rights for decades.

The state’s water supply is uncertain, and in 2001, state legislators created the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District to develop the region’s water policy and coordinate its implementation.

We called up Stevens, who told PolitiFact Georgia that she typically says that the planning district is ""a"" national leader in conservation, not ""the"" national leader, but she doesn’t dispute the accuracy of the news story. We evaluated her quote as published.

We also sought out top experts in water conservation for their assessments.

They acknowledged that the Atlanta region has made improvements in its water planning, but all thought that calling the area ""the"" national leader, or even ""a"" national leader, goes too far.

""None of that is true,"" said Mary Ann Dickinson, executive director for the Alliance for Water Efficiency, a national water conservation group.

""I wouldn’t say that metro Atlanta is the leader in conservation efficiency by any means,"" said Jenny Hoffner, the director of the water supply program for American Rivers, a national group that advocates for clean water and conservation.

""On its face, it’s a silly claim. But that’s not to say that Atlanta hasn’t made some great strides,"" said Charles Fishman, a journalist who specializes in water issues.

Stevens cited several specifics to defend her statement. We’ll address the major ones here.  
  
* Nowhere else in the country have so many local governments come together to do this kind of work over such a short period of time: The metro water district covers 15 counties from Hall to Coweta counties, an area that includes more than 90 cities and dozens of water systems.   
  
It was founded in 2001, decades after similar organizations in places such as Southern California and Las Vegas were founded.   
The North Georgia district is relatively young. But at least one larger area -- California -- is implementing specific water conservation goals. A 2009 law requires the state to reduce urban per-capita water use 20 percent by 2020.   
  
As of 2009, the local district’s plans were less ambitious. Water planners expect a 13 percent reduction in water use by 2035 if water systems follow district rules. The district has since made changes to its rules that are not accounted for in this prediction.   
* Declines in per-capita water use: According to metro water district numbers, per-capita water use has declined from 149 gallons per day in 2000 to 110 gallons in 2010. 
Critics said that outside factors such as the economy might play a role in this reduction Utility use typically declines during a downturn. 
* Following North Georgia water district conservation rules is mandatory: The 2001 state statute establishing the water district requires members to follow the district’s rules or face permit revocation. 
No permit has been revoked for water conservation problems, a Georgia Environmental Protection Division spokesman said. 
California also sanctions water suppliers who fail to comply with its water conservation statute. They are not eligible for state water grants or loans. 

Experts gave PolitiFact Georgia other rebuttals to the metro district’s claims.

Dickinson noted that the district does not fund conservation efforts such as low-flow toilet replacement rebates. That’s the responsibility of local governments and water services.

By way of contrast, Dickinson cited the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. This water district has budgeted $19.1 million this fiscal year to fund business and consumer rebates on things such as more efficient toilets, sprinklers, washing machines, and for pulling out water-thirsty turf, according to its spokesman.

All the experts we interviewed noted that the North Georgia district has not set specific, mandatory water use reduction goals as California has done.

They also listed programs they think are innovative and more effective at reducing water use. They included a law in Orlando that requires developers to install reclaimed water lines to new subdivisions. In San Antonio, nonprofit businesses can get low-flow toilets for free, including installation.

The Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District certainly deserves credit where credit is due. Per-capita water use is down (though the cause is disputed) and current rules do aim to conserve water.

But we found no consensus that the region has a reputation as a national leader in water conservation, much less as ""the"" national leader.

Given what we found, a stronger claim is that the region is playing catch-up. The Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District was formed decades after similar organizations elsewhere, and it doesn’t fund conservation efforts that other areas have",Mostly False,"March 6, 2012"
"Wisconsin is called the Badger State because ""our ancestors came here with the hopes of living the American dream by mining.""","Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker wants to make it easier for a proposed iron ore mine, said to be worth more than $1 billion and packing potentially thousands of jobs, to win state approval.

The Republican governor, who made creating 250,000 private-sector jobs his signature campaign promise, mostly touts expected economic benefits. But, pointing to symbols on the state flag, he also argues that mining is central to Wisconsin’s history.

In a Feb. 23, 2012 interview on WTMJ-AM (620) in Milwaukee, Walker expressed hope that the Legislature would pass a bill to ""streamline"" the mine approval process. Then he made a claim about the state animal that might surprise some of us in Wisconsin who weren’t paying attention in school.

""If there's any state in America that should be able to"" adopt a mining bill that balances job creation and environmental safety, ""it should be the Badger State,"" Walker said.

""Because we're called the Badgers not because the animals are abundant here, but because we got nicknamed the Badgers because, back before we were a state, our ancestors came here with the hopes of living the American dream by mining. We should be able to do it again here in Wisconsin in 2012 and beyond.""

To be sure, the main issues involving the proposed mine are money and the environment. We found to be Mostly True a claim that the mine proposed for near Hurley in far northern Wisconsin could generate billions of dollars of economic activity over 100 years.

Meanwhile, one Wisconsin conservation organization has said a mining bill pending in the Legislature would allow groundwater to be polluted and ""our most sensitive wetlands to be filled in with mining waste.""

But given the governor’s new tack on promoting mining, we wondered whether Wisconsin, known more for brewing, milking and sausage making, got its Badgers nickname because of mining.

Wisconsin mining origins

Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie pointed us to a Wisconsin Historical Society article that explains the importance of mining in the state’s history.

It said in part:

""In the early nineteenth century, Wisconsin lead mining was more promising and attractive to potential settlers than either the fur trade or farming. Its potentially quick rewards lured a steady stream of settlers up the Mississippi River and into Grant, Crawford, Iowa, and Lafayette counties in the early nineteenth century. By 1829, more than 4,000 miners worked in southwestern Wisconsin, producing 13 million pounds of lead a year.""

As for mining’s connection to the badger, Werwie cited the state symbols section of the 2011-2012 Wisconsin Blue Book. It says that images on the state flag include a ""yeoman (usually considered a miner) with a pick,"" a mining pick and shovel, and  13 lead ingots that represent ""mineral wealth,"" as well as a badger.

The Blue Book continues:

""History, rather than the law, explains Wisconsin’s unofficial nickname as the ‘Badger State.’ During the lead-mining boom that began just prior to 1830 in southwestern Wisconsin, the name was first applied to miners who were too busy digging the ‘gray gold’ to build houses. Like badgers, they moved into abandoned mine shafts and makeshift burrows for shelter. Although ‘badgers’ had a somewhat derogatory connotation at first, it gradually gained acceptance as an apt description of the hardworking and energetic settlers of the Wisconsin Territory.""

The state historical society and the Blue Book are as solid as lead as sources on state history.

We also found similar accounts about the connection between mining and the badger nickname in the historical society’s ""Dictionary of Wisconsin History"" and in a 1918 Milwaukee Sentinel article.

Few miners ‘badgers’?

But an article from the winter 1992-1993 edition of the historical society’s Wisconsin Magazine of History raised questions.

Then-Marquette University history professor Karel Bicha wrote that proving the conventional wisdom about mining and the badger nickname ""leads the investigator along an evidentiary pipeline which is ludicrously tenuous."" That’s because the traditional understanding, he said, ""derives largely from ‘tradition’ rather than verifiable ‘history.’""

""Tradition aside,"" Bicha continued, ""it is legitimate to wonder whether there were ever, in reality, any cave- or dugout-dwelling miners. If so, who first observed them in their natural or man-made hillside orifices and divined the inelegant nickname ‘badgers’ to refer to them?""

He goes on to say there is plenty of evidence of large numbers of miners living in cabins and other dwellings, but little evidence that more than a small number lived as ""badgers,"" or that they stayed in their caves or dugouts for very long.

Nevertheless, Bicha concludes:

""Realistically, the importance of the sobriquet ‘badgers’ lies not in its origin but in its diffusion. The diffusion of the term undoubtedly occurred by the same rapid and undocumentable process of oral transmission characteristic of slang, argot and jokes.

""Within two decades of its creation the expression had become divested of its specific association with both miners and the lead region. By the mid-1840s it made no difference whether the badger tradition was rooted in past reality or possessed no more inherent substance than the legend of William Tell. It was synonymous with Wisconsin and its people -- all of its people."" University of Wisconsin-Madison folklore professor James Leary, director of the Center for the Study of Upper Midwestern Cultures, notes -- somewhat disturbingly -- that badgers had quite a different definition in the British volume known as the 1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue. Badgers were ""a crew of desperate villains who robbed near rivers, into which they threw the bodies of those they murdered.""

Yikes.

But Leary reassured us that the origin of the badgers nickname in Wisconsin is from mining. ""There’s no doubt about that,"" he said.

Our rating

Walker said Wisconsin is called the Badger State because ""our ancestors came here with the hopes of living the American dream by mining."" At least one scholar suggests that the number of miners who lived like badgers was relatively small. But he and other authorities agree that the dwelling habits of at least some of the miners are what gave Wisconsin its nickname",True,"March 5, 2012"
Says there’s no proven instance where hydraulic fracking has polluted groundwater.,"
Before he suspended his candidacy for president, Texas Gov. Rick Perry gave a spirited defense of fracking, a process that extracts natural gas from thousands of feet underground.

""You cannot show me one place where there is a proven – not one – where there is a proven pollution of groundwater by hydraulic fracking,"" Perry told a college student who raised the topic at a December 18, 2011, stop in Decorah, Iowa, according to the Texas Tribune.

Not one?

Perry’s sweeping claim tracks with the November 2011 release of preliminary findings of a study by the University of Texas Energy Institute. A November 10, 2011, Austin American-Statesman news article quoted the study’s leader, UT geologist Charles ""Chip"" Groat, saying hydraulic fracturing ""doesn’t seem to be of concern to groundwater.""

Groat said the study had looked at regulatory violations and frameworks in states with major shale drilling operations, including Texas, Louisiana, New York and Pennsylvania. ""The violations that we've seen are of no, minor or small impact,"" he said.

Perry’s claim also echoed more than 25 others made by regulatory officials, as compiled by a pro-drilling group, as well as a May 2011 assessment by the head of the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA’s administrator, Lisa Jackson, was asked at a May 24, 2011, hearing of the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform whether hydraulic fracturing can affect aquifers and water supplies. Jackson replied: ""There is evidence that it can certainly affect them. I am not aware of any proven case where the fracking process itself has affected water.""

The ""fracking process itself""?

Fracking might be fun to say, but it’s a little slippery to define.

Both Jackson and Perry were using a very specific definition of fracking, their spokeswomen told us by email, referring only to the step in the process where the shale rock is fractured.

In high-pressure hydraulic fracturing for natural gas, a mix of water, sand and chemicals is shot down into the well, bursting out of holes in the pipe lining the well and cracking the gas-bearing shale rock. Gas then flows from the cracks back up the pipe for collection. The immense increase in fracking since the mid-2000s came about because companies began to use this process in horizontally drilled wells, which cost more but also reach more of the layer of shale that lies as deep as two miles below the earth’s surface.

But the energy industry and environmental groups use the term fracking in very different ways.
Fracking expert Terry Engelder, a professor of geosciences at Pennsylvania State University, mapped out the two positions for us.

""Industry likes to restrict the use of the term hydraulic fracturing to just that process taking place underground during which time high-pressure water opens natural cracks or creates new cracks at the depths of the reservoir rock,"" Engelder told us by email.

Conversely, Engelder said, opponents of drilling ""consider fracking to encompass the entire process from leasing land through drilling and sending natural gas to market.""

PolitiFact Ohio acknowledged as much in a July 14, 2011, article. Evidence supported an Ohio lawmaker’s claim that state agencies had no proof of groundwater contamination from fracking, though the statement was rated Mostly True because in one case, a state panel found that a well’s cement casing allowed gas to seep into water wells (and up into homes, causing an explosion).

Even by the narrow definition, some environmentalists say that EPA reports from 1987 and 2011 prove that fracking has contaminated water.

The 1987 report (unearthed last year by the national nonprofit Environmental Working Group) said that ""residual"" fracking fluid ""migrated"" into a private water well after a nearby gas well had been fractured in West Virginia. The Dec. 8, 2011, preliminary report found fracking was a possible cause of groundwater contamination in Pavilion, Wyo., where a company was fracking inside an aquifer -- an unusual case, according to the report.

EPA spokeswoman Betsaida Alcantara offered us no comment on the 1987 report, though an Aug. 4, 2011, news story by an independent nonprofit news organization, ProPublica, quotes an unidentified EPA official as saying the agency was reviewing that case.

The 2011 report, Alcantara told us, ""tentatively found a link between groundwater contamination in an aquifer with hydraulic fracturing. The report is not final and it will now go through independent scientific review.""

Also using the narrow definition, other regulatory officials said they did not know of groundwater pollution by fracking.

The Texas Railroad Commission regulates fracking in Texas. Commission spokeswoman Gaye Greever McElwain told us, ""Commission records do not indicate a single documented water contamination case associated with the process of hydraulic fracturing in Texas.

Similarly, an official with the National Groundwater Protection Council told us in a telephone interview that fracking has not been proven to contaminate groundwater. Mike Paque, executive director of the council comprising groundwater regulators and oil/gas regulators from state agencies, said the depth at which shale is fractured makes contamination by fracking itself practically impossible.

""There’s no water down there to drink,"" Paque said. ""Private wells go a couple hundred feet down, and these are 11,000 feet down. So the fact that people say that, and that my state regulatory agencies say that, and the drinking water agencies say that, is correct, period.""

To get our own fix on possible water pollution by fracking, we examined lists of incidents that were described as fracking-related by EarthJustice, a nonprofit law firm; the National Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy nonprofit group; and ThinkProgress, a blog run by the American Progress Action Fund, a liberal think-tank.

Because we were seeking ""proven"" groundwater contamination, we first eliminated claims not related to water pollution and accounts that did not include independent evidence, such as a state investigation or newspaper story. Of the remaining 56 claims of groundwater contamination, not a single one fit the ""industry"" definition of fracking -- the one Perry was using, his spokeswoman, Lucy Nashed, told us.

Yet how close to that step in the process were they? We identified 11 incidents that appeared to be both substantiated by outside evidence and linked to an essential part of the process of hydraulically fracturing a well. The 11 included events such as fracking fluid leaking from wastewater pits or from pipe lining a fracked well. Several were ""blowouts,"" which Engelder defined for us as the (normally controlled) process in which ""high pressure gas blows fracking water out of the well to clear the way for natural gas production.""

A few examples: 
The two views of fracking seem irreconcilable.

Jason Pitt, a spokesman for the Sierra Club, told us by email: ""Fracking is just one small part of an overall industrial process to extract natural gas. When speaking about ground water contamination, it is very misleading to refer back to just the fracking process."" He said there are many cases of water contamination ""that have occurred as a result of natural gas extraction across the country.""

Engelder, the Penn State geologist, disagreed. ""Anti-drillers,"" he said, ""have lots of proof of spills and leaks and other stuff including noise pollution and so forth because they consider fracking to be the all-encompassing, creeping industrialization of rural areas.""

Attempts to tie events such as surface spills to hydraulic fracturing miss the point, he said. ""Fracking is such a toxic word in the English language that Americans are blaming all sorts of bad things on it when, in fact, Governor Perry was using the term hydraulic fracturing correctly in his comment.""

Our ruling

Perry’s comment, focused on ""proven"" incidents of groundwater polluted by the specific step of breaking the shale rock, holds up. However, the definition of fracking is debated -- and if we rope in all incidents that take place at such wells, there have been more than a few reported incidents of groundwater contamination",Mostly True,"February 29, 2012"
"""You can’t put a gun rack in a [Chevrolet] Volt.""","Republican presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich recently went gunnin’ for greenies.

Gingrich’s target is the Chevy Volt, an electric car that also can run on gas. During a recent Republican presidential campaign swing through Georgia, he revved up crowds by calling it the car that rich, liberal environmentalists think you ought to drive.

President Barack Obama would make you ditch your gas guzzler at the side of the road for the Volt, if he had his way, Gingrich warned.

""This is an administration that is deeply opposed to Americans having the right to choose the kind of car or truck they want to drive,"" the former Georgia congressman told a crowd in Cobb County on Saturday. ""And I keep trying to get across to my liberal friends: You cannot put a gun rack in a Volt.""

Slow down there, Mr. Speaker. You can’t put a gun rack in a Volt?

Is Gingrich taking us for a ride?

We realize this is not a pressing policy issue. And Gingrich was obviously trying to inject a little humor in what has been a demolition derby of a campaign.

But PolitiFact Georgia decided it was time for a little detour from our typical GOP primary coverage.

We set the Truth-O-Meter’s sights on Gingrich’s high-voltage claim.

We contacted the Gingrich campaign for a comment, but did not get a reply by the time this article went to press.

The Chevy Volt is a $40,000 electric car. The midsize sedan can travel about 35 miles on battery power alone, but if you need to go a few hundred miles farther, the gas tank kicks in.

To charge the Volt, you hook the battery to an orange cord stored under the trunk carpet. The other end plugs into an electrical outlet.

Chevy designed the Volt with so-called ""early adapters"" and green technology fans in mind, company spokesman Robert Peterson said. Owners tend to have high incomes and are concerned about the environment and U.S. energy dependence.

Chevy manufactures cargo nets, floor mats, a sunshade and an ashtray for the Volt, but nary a gun rack, Peterson said.

""It’s not something we normally consider,"" he said. He lent us a Volt for our fact check.

Car experts weren’t sure a gun rack would fit.

""You certainly CAN put a gun rack in a Volt, if you're talking about a tactical shotgun with a dash-mounted rack, as in a police cruiser,"" said Dan Neil, Pulitzer-winning car columnist and author of the ""Rumble Seat"" column in The Wall Street Journal. ""A window rack, like in pickups? No, that would be difficult.""

Gingrich took his gun rack quip on the road. He repeated it in Tulsa, Okla., on Monday before a crowd of 3,000 at Oral Roberts University.

We heard Gingrich say it again as we sat behind the wheel of a borrowed Chevy Volt, listening to the Sean Hannity radio show. We were hunting for a gun rack, and the Volt did its best to help. It started with the push of a button, and greeted us with a melody that sounded like a harp on Auto-Tune. A screen showed us the location of nearby stores.  

The Volt’s pearly center console glowed under buttons lit up in cobalt blue. We felt as if R2-D2’s younger, sexier brother was our co-pilot.  

Local gun store salesmen told us we could get a truck accessory store to customize a rack. We found a video online that showed a Volt owner rigging one up with plastic piping and plywood.

We don’t think these were what the former House speaker had in mind. PolitiFact Georgia opted to test products we could buy off the shelf. We returned to the newsroom parking lot with three gun racks and a stick as a gun stand-in.

The stick was a precaution. We didn’t want our co-workers to get the wrong idea. It was about 40 inches long, or roughly the length of a shorter shotgun.

The first contraption suspended guns on two racks behind the Volt’s seats. They hooked onto the car’s rear headrests and handily balanced the stick.

It was designed to fit two long guns.

The second used two camouflage neoprene slings to cradle up to two guns behind the car’s front seats. They fit, but not well. The slides of the Volt’s heated seats were in the way. We tied the slings’ bottom attachments to the front seat belt anchors instead.

That’s four long guns.

The third rack was designed to show off guns in the car’s rear window. The kit came with two plastic hooks with long adjustable bases. Each end was shaped like a wedge.

They fit snugly in the space between the upholstery and window, but were about 8 inches too short.

It was nothing that duct tape and PVC pipe couldn’t fix, but no self-respecting Georgian would display his guns that way. We checked online and found window racks that we think would work.

How do we rule?

Gingrich said you can’t put a gun rack in a Chevrolet Volt. We installed two gun racks that tote four guns combined.

"Says President Barack Obama ""has an Environmental Protection Agency proposal that would raise the price of gasoline by 25 cents a gallon.""","What better way to scare American voters than tell them the government wants them to pay 25 cents a gallon more for gas?

In an appearance on Meet the Press on Feb. 5, 2012, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich argued that President Obama’s policies have ""weakened the country.""

Prime example: ""He has an Environmental Protection Agency proposal that would raise the price of gasoline by 25 cents a gallon. There are very few Americans who want to see the price of gasoline raised by government ... 25 cents a gallon.""

We think Gingrich is probably right about that second part. We decided to look further into the first.

EPA and reducing tailpipe emissions

Gingrich’s campaign spokesman, R.C. Hammond, directed us to recent news coverage of the EPA’s proposed ""Tier 3"" regulations on fuel emissions.

The regulations are part of Obama’s multi-year plan to reduce tailpipe pollution. Initially, his administration created the first-ever fuel economy and greenhouse gas requirements for trucks. Next the administration set such standards for cars, light trucks, and sport-utility vehicles, called ""light-duty vehicles,"" for model years 2017- 2025, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Now, the EPA is working to create a new set of emissions standards to reduce pollution from these light-duty vehicles. These would update standards that EPA set in 1999.

But the potential costs of the new regulations have some politicians up in arms. Hammond pointed us to a letter signed by six U.S. senators to EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson raising concerns about the proposed action.

""With gasoline prices already high, and with so many Americans already struggling to make ends meet, we urge you to recognize that now is not the time for new regulations that will raise the price of fuel even further,"" the letter stated. It went on to cite a study by the consulting firm Baker & O’Brien, which estimated capital and annual costs of complying with the new regulations of $17 billion and $13 billion respectively and predicted oil refinery closures and an increase in gasoline prices of 12 to 25 cents per gallon.

That’s where Gingrich’s 25-cent statement came from. But there are some important things to know about this study.

First, it was conducted for the American Petroleum Institute, an oil industry trade group.

""At the very least, industry-sponsored studies (and interest-group sponsored studies, for that matter) should always be taken with a grain of salt,"" said David Jenkins, vice president for government and political affairs for Republicans for Environmental Protection. ""Candidates should not be reciting such studies as gospel, since they know, or should know, that a study can be engineered to produce whatever results the sponsor would like by tweaking the choice of assumptions.""

Second, the Baker & O’Brien study assumes two major changes in the standards: lowering the sulfur content in gasoline and adjusting something called Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), a measure of fuel volatility.

But the study was initiated before the EPA made its intentions known, according to Michelle Robinson with the Union of Concerned Scientists. Now, the EPA has said it is only exploring changes in sulfur levels.

Baker & O’Brien’s conclusions were based on four scenarios, all of which assumed lower RVP requirements.

Robinson wrote in an email that ""while the API study did not distinguish the costs of reducing the RVP from the costs of lowering sulfur content, a review of the report indicates that most of the costs are due to the RVP reduction.""

That means that the biggest chunk of the costs are expected from a change that EPA has said it isn’t seeking.

Said Robinson: ""The oil industry study is dramatically overstating the cleanup costs because it is based on a false premise.""

Other evidence

We found another study examining the impacts of Tier 3, commissioned by the International Council for Clean Transportation, a nonprofit foundation that seeks to improve transportation efficiency in order to reduce climate change. This study specifically included a scenario which allowed the gasoline sulfur improvement to be isolated from the RVP improvement, Robinson told us.

Conducted by the refinery consulting firm MathPro, this study concluded that the price
of reducing the average gasoline sulfur content would be less than one cent per gallon.

EPA did not respond to our inquiry, but in several published reports we found references to remarks by Margo Oge of EPA's Office of Transportation and Air Quality. She said Jan. 26, 2012, at the Washington Auto Show that the oil industry’s cost projections were based costs of a program that ""EPA is not planning to propose.""

Our ruling

Gingrich warned that under Obama, the EPA plans to raise gasoline prices by 25 cents a gallon.

He drew that information from an industry-funded study considering the cost impacts of the EPA’s proposed Tier 3 fuel standards and went right for the high end of the estimate. ""Surely he knows that API has a vested interest in presenting a high projection,"" said Jenkins, of Republicans for Environmental Protection.

Even more importantly, the study concluded its cost estimates based on fuel-standard changes that EPA is not considering. When looking only at lowering the sulfur content of gasoline, the cost would be far lower -- even less than a penny per gallon, according to a study commissioned by an environmental group",False,"February 7, 2012"
"In the 2011 legislative session, DEQ's budget was cut 18.5 percent — a disproportionate cut compared to other natural resource agencies.","
In an effort to spare the budget of the Department of Environmental Quality, the Oregon Environmental Council and the Oregon Business Association sent a letter to legislators in January, ahead of the monthlong session that started Feb. 1.

""In the 2011 legislative session,"" the letter states, ""DEQ's budget was disproportionately cut compared to other natural resource agencies. Overall, DEQis budget cuts totaled 18.5 percent, while the Department of Agriculture experienced a 1.5 percent budget decrease, and the Department of Fish and Wildlife received an 18.3 percent increase.""

Is that true? We know DEQ’s job is to make sure our vehicles aren’t smoggy and that businesses aren’t polluting our water. We also know the agency is a lightning rod for legislators who claim it over regulates. We didn’t know it had been hit disproportionately when compared with other natural resource agencies.

Andrea Salinas, legislative director for the Oregon Environmental Council, quickly clarified in an interview that she did not mean to pit DEQ against the other natural resource agencies. She also said they meant to limit the comparison to the two agencies cited -- Agriculture and Fish and Wildlife.

She called the letter a preemptive plea, with projected state revenue down roughly $300 million since the 2011-13 budget was approved in June 2011. We should note that natural resource agencies take up just a fraction -- about $300 million -- of the state’s $15 billion general fund budget. ""Natural resources in the general fund is hurting,"" Salinas said, ""and we’d like to see natural resources in the general fund remain whole.""

See how Salinas refers to the general fund. That’s the part lawmakers control most directly, and it’s what they need to re-balance this month.

In the letter, however, the environmental and business group are talking about the agency’s total budget, which includes federal money, grant money and user fee money, as well as state money.

It’s true that DEQ’s total budget decreased 18 percent in 2011-13, from 2009-11, and that Agriculture decreased only 1.5 percent and Fish and Wildlife increased 18 percent. But other natural resource agencies were harder hit in total funds, notably the Department of Energy and the Department of Land Conservation and Development.

As we’ve said, legislators don’t have control over how much money we get from the federal government, and that’s not what they’re in Salem to re-jigger.

If you look at the part they can re-balance, Fish and Wildlife took a much greater hit than DEQ: a 34 percent decrease, compared with an 18 percent decrease for DEQ. (Yes, the decrease in both DEQ budgets was 18 percent.) For Agriculture, the hit was 14 percent.

That’s a telling bit of information.

The uptick in Fish and Wildlife’s overall budget, by the way, came from a 30 percent increase in user fees and a 12 percent boost in federal money.

The bottom line is that there are other natural resource agencies that have taken greater budget hits than DEQ, whether you measure by total funds or general funds, including one of the agencies cited.

The statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details",Half True,"February 7, 2012"
"A proposed mine in Wisconsin is ""about two-thirds the size of Lake Winnebago.""","Would a proposed iron ore mine in Wisconsin be nearly the size of one of the nation’s largest inland lakes?

About an hour into an 11-hour legislative hearing on Jan. 11, 2012, state Rep. Penny Bernard Schaber, D-Appleton, worried aloud about environmental damage such an operation might cause.

The second-term Assembly member compared the mine to Lake Winnebago, the largest of Wisconsin’s 15,000 inland lakes and one of the largest freshwater inland lakes in the U.S.

""That's a very large lake that's right at the end of the area that I represent,  extremely large lake. And from what I've tried to figure out on the central size of this mine, it could be about two-thirds the size of Lake Winnebago,"" Bernard Schaber said. ""And Lake Winnebago, I encourage you to go there. I’ve ridden my bike around it and it’s a hundred miles-plus to ride your bike around the lake.""

Size would help determine whether the mine would help create thousands of jobs, as its supporters contend, as well as what impact it would have on land and water.

So let’s see if Bernard Schaber’s comparison measures up. Billion-dollar mine

News surfaced in November 2010 that Gogebic Taconite proposed to spend more than $1 billion to develop an open-pit iron ore mine more than 300 miles northwest of Milwaukee in far northern Wisconsin. It would take years to open the mine, if various government approvals are won.

Gogebic Taconite hasn’t made a formal proposal to the state as it waits to see whether Assembly Bill 426, which has generated lobbying activity by 34 organizations, becomes law. The bill, which would relax environmental standards and public participation in the review process for the mine, was approved Jan. 26, 2012 by the Republican-controlled Assembly, with Bernard Schaber and every other Democrat in attendance voting no.

Gogebic president Bill Williams told PolitiFact Wisconsin the company would need up to 5,000 acres to encompass the mine -- roughly four miles long and a half-mile wide -- and facilities such as roads, waste-rock storage and ore processing.

That would be nowhere near two-thirds the size of Lake Winnebago, which has an area of about 138,000 acres.

We sought out a state mine expert and spoke with Ann Coakley, director of the waste and materials management bureau of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. She noted Gogebic has spoken about a possibly wider mine -- 1.5 miles wide rather than a half-mile. But even at that, she estimated that the total footprint likely would be 10,000 acres. That, too, is much less than two-thirds the area of Lake Winnebago. Lawmaker's evidence So, does Bernard Schaber have evidence that the mine would be two-thirds as big as the lake?

No and yes.

Legislative aide Eric Koch said his boss believes the space needed for the related facilities, added to the mine itself, would make the total footprint two-thirds the size of the lake. But he acknowledged she has no solid data to support that estimate.  

In a written summary and other documents Bernard Schaber provided to back up her claim, she introduced a different measurement: volume.

She starts with the dimensions of Lake Winnebago, citing a DNR document. If we round the figures Bernard Schaber cites, the lake has an area of nearly 138,000 acres, which is about 6 billion square feet. She multiplies 6 billion square feet by the lake’s average depth of 15.5 feet, for a total of 93 billion cubic feet.

Now to the size of the mine.

Noting that Gogebic Taconite has given varying dimensions of what the size of the mine itself might be, Bernard Schaber used a length of 4.5 miles and a width of three-quarters of a mile. That comes to 3.375 square miles or about 94 million square feet. She multiplies that figure by 1,000 feet, which has been the reported depth of the mine, to come up with a total of 94 billion cubic feet -- a volume even larger than Lake Winnebago’s.

Gogebic Taconite’s Williams told us the mine’s depth would range from 700 to 1,000 feet. But even if we used 700 instead of 1,000 in the equation, we’d get a mine depth of 66 billion cubic feet -- more than two-thirds the volume of Lake Winnebago.

So, when depth is added to length and width, the mine is at or near the size of the lake. But at the hearing Bernard Schaber -- who spoke of biking around the lake -- was clearly referring to area, not volume.

"""We never had an earthquake in Youngstown until John Kasich was elected Governor,""","
When a 4.0 earthquake likely caused by fracking waste injected into a fault line occurred in Youngstown on New Year's Eve, one of the residents whose home was shaken by the quake was state Rep. Robert Hagan.

The veteran Democratic lawmaker from Youngstown has a well-earned reputation for being outspoken so it's no surprise that Hagan has taken the lead in calling for a moratorium on injecting waste deep into the ground and asking pointed questions about the incident..

At a Jan. 10 statehouse protest to support the moratorium on waste disposal wells, Hagan told the crowd that the earthquake had raised a number of questions including why Gov. John Kasich's administration did not react more quickly to 10 smaller earthquakes which had struck the Youngstown area in the 10 months preceding the New Year’s Eve shake-up.

The Democratic lawmaker even seemed to lay the blame for the quake at the feet of Kasich.

""We never had an earthquake in Youngstown until John Kasich was elected Governor,"" Hagan said.

Hagan's claim shook up the sensors at the Politifact Ohio monitoring center. Was Youngstown really earthquake-free until John Kasich became the state's chief executive on Jan. 10, 2011?

We contacted Hagan who said he consulted a map of earthquakes in Ohio produced by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources before he made his comment. ""Sure, there's been some minor seismic activity, but earthquakes -- which is a 2.0 (on the Richter Scale) or better -- haven't happened until the past year,"" Hagan said. ""That's what ODNR's own map shows.""

We checked with ODNR and the state's seismic monitoring system -- which has only been in place since about 1999 hasn't detected any earthquakes in the Youngstown area prior to March 2011. ""We have not recorded a significantly felt seismic event in Youngstown since the networks were put in place about 1999,"" said Ohio Department of Natural Resources spokesman Carlo LoParo.

Prior to the monitoring equipment being in place, ODNR’s record of historical earthquakes in Ohio relies on other monitoring systems such as those done by the U.S. Geological Survey and accounts from newspaper reports. And those don't show any earthquakes in Youngstown.

However, LoParo said there have been other earthquakes nearby that were felt in Youngstown. ""There have been some significant earthquakes in Ashtabula, Summit County and Mercer County, Pennsylvania that were felt across northeast Ohio and in Youngstown,"" LoParo said.

Youngstown State professor Jeffrey Dick, the chair of the school’s Geological and Environmental Sciences Department, also confirmed that Youngstown itself has been a quiet zone seismically before the recent series of earthquakes thought to be linked to the injection well.

""Earthquakes in this part of Ohio are pretty uncommon,"" he said. ""The reason is that underneath the ground in this part of the state is what's known as the Grenville Province -- it's a body of rock that is sometimes known as the Precambrian basement rock of Ohio. And it doesn't have major structural features that would cause earthquakes."" Dick said he wasn't aware of any earthquakes centered in Youngstown prior to the recent series linked to the injection well.

He said most earthquakes in Ohio run along major fault lines, such as one running under eastern Lake Erie waters or another in western Ohio centered around Shelby County, not far from the Indiana border.

Indeed, it looks like Hagan is right that earthquakes haven't come to Youngstown before March 2011 when Kasich was governor.

But regardless of the timing of the quakes, Hagan makes a rhetorical stretch to imply that the earthquake happened because Kasich was governor.

The injection wells are not something that Kasich is the first governor to allow -- they have been around for several decades. And Kasich did not weaken regulations on drilling regulations or do anything that could be construed as making it more likely the earthquake would happen.

In fact, state regulators have said the company that owns the Youngstown well -- D&L Energy -- was not violating its permit by injecting too much waste or injecting it too quickly into the ground.

So let’s drill down to the core here:
  
Earthquakes linked to injection wells are relatively rare occurrences, so it seems that the Kasich administration is probably more unlucky than anything to be in charge when it happened.

We’ll give Hagan a point for his geologic accuracy, but he can’t shake the fact that Kasich isn’t the cause of the quakes",Half True,"January 24, 2012"
"""Many types of fish and shellfish from waters across the state are labeled unsafe to eat.""","
There’s plenty of fish in the waters of New Jersey, along with lots of other things: mercury, polychlorobiphenyls and dioxin, among them.

And according to a former governor, there could be some danger in eating fish from Garden State waters.

""Many types of fish and shellfish from waters across the state are labeled unsafe to eat,"" Jim Florio wrote in a Dec. 14 guest column in The Star-Ledger about how new reductions in mercury pollution will protect New Jerseyans from contaminated seafood.

It turns out Florio wasn’t exactly telling a fish tale, PolitiFact New Jersey found.

""I think that’s a fair and accurate statement actually,"" said Kerry Pflugh, manager of Constituent Services for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. ""But that doesn’t mean that everything we catch is unsafe to eat. … Advisories are not based on water quality, it’s based on what’s in the fish itself. Fish advisories are set by tissue analysis, not water quality.""

Jonathan Scott, communications director for Clean Water Action in Washington, DC said, ""We would agree with his assessment.""

Florio could not be reached for comment.

How are fish consumption advisories formulated?

Fish collected from New Jersey waterways are sent to The Academy of Sciences of Drexel University in Philadelphia. Tissue samples are taken to test for contaminants – mostly mercury, PCBs, DDT and other pesticides, said Richard Horwitz, senior biologist at the academy.

A committee decides an acceptable risk for eating a particular fish based on potential health issues for people considered ""high risk"": children, pregnant women and women of child-bearing age, Horwitz said. They are advised to eat smaller portions of fish and less often.

The 2010 Fish Consumption Advisories for all New Jersey waterways is available at the DEP’s Office Of Science website. The 30-page document explains what parts of fish are safe to eat; proper preparation; consumption frequency; and more.

""Fish is a very healthy source of protein, vitamins and minerals,"" said Dr. Gary Buchanan, manager for the DEP’s Office of Science. ""Just be careful about the fish you eat when catching them in local waters.""

The state also considers federal recommendations made by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

""The EPA provides guidance to assist states, Indian tribes and local governments in developing methods of monitoring, gathering and assessing information about their fish populations,"" EPA press officer John Martin said in an email. ""Since this information is only guidance, use by states is not mandatory. The States have primary responsibility for monitoring, assessing and making advisory decisions. Thus the basis for each State fish advisory varies.""

While a variety of contaminants are found in fish, mercury is the most prevalent, experts told us.

The mercury found in New Jersey waters comes from air pollution emitted from power plants, coal plants and incinerators from Pennsylvania and the Midwest, according to Buchanan, Horwitz and Scott.

""If those sources from out of state are reduced, that will help speed up the reduction of mercury in our waters and our fish and help allow additional fish consumption,"" Buchanan said. ""It is a nationwide problem. It’s not just a New Jersey problem. Every state in the country has a fish advisory for some parameter and some species.""

Even with the chemicals found in fish, New Jerseyans shouldn’t fear eating fish caught from the state’s waters, said Tom Fote, legislative chairman for the Jersey Coast Anglers Association in Toms River, as long as fish consumption guidelines are followed.

""Seafood coming out of New Jersey waters is no different than the seafood coming from out of any other state,"" Fote said.

Florio said in a recent opinion column in The Star-Ledger that most fish from New Jersey waterways ""is labeled unsafe to eat.""

The proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline is a bipartisan proposal.,"The major party candidates in the 1st Congressional District are on opposite sides of whether President Barack Obama should approve the building of a massive oil pipeline project from Canada to Texas.

Democrat Suzanne Bonamici is opposed; she worries about the environmental impact. Republican Rob Cornilles is supportive; he said in last week’s televised debate, about halfway throughthe program, that the project has bipartisan support.

""I do support the Keystone Pipeline. It’s a bipartisan proposal. Democrats and Republicans alike in Congress want this to move forward, because it’s not only a job creator, it’s also a way for us to responsibly manage how that oil is transferred from Canada to Mexico.

Does the pipeline have bipartisan support?

Much of the really vocal support for this project comes from Republicans. Democrats, not so much, although there are some who want the project. Environmentalists are opposed while labor’s AFL-CIO has decided not to take a formal position.

Senate Democrats who like the project are Max Baucus D-Mont., Jon Tester D-Mont., Mary Landrieu D-La., Mark Pryor, D-Ark., and Mark Begich, D-Alaska, Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and Kent Conrad, D-N.D.

"Says Newt Gingrich ""co-sponsored a bill with Nancy Pelosi that would have given $60 million a year to a U.N. program supporting China’s brutal one-child policy.""","The best offense is a good defense: That seems to be the playbook for the Restore Our Future super PAC.

The game started when Newt Gingrich attacked Mitt Romney for laying off workers while Romney worked at Bain Capital. Then Restore our Future, which is run by Romney supporters, attacked Gingrich for some his previous positions. (Super PACs operate outside of official campaigns and don’t have to follow the same rules.)

""Newt Gingrich’s attacks are called 'foolish,' 'out of bounds,' and 'disgusting.' Newt attacks because he has more baggage than the airlines,"" says the ad, which is running in Florida and South Carolina.

""Newt was fined $300,000 for ethics violations, took $1.6 million from Freddie Mac, and co-sponsored a bill with Nancy Pelosi that would have given $60 million a year to a U.N. program supporting China’s brutal one-child policy.""

""Don’t be fooled by Newt’s desperate attacks,"" the ad concludes.

The ad is right that Gingrich was fined $300,000 for ethics violations. Gingrich also concedes that he advised Freddie Mac. (Bloomberg reported he was paid $1.6 million, but that specific amount rests on unnamed sources.)

Here, we wanted to fact-check whether Gingrich ""co-sponsored a bill with Nancy Pelosi that would have given $60 million a year to a U.N. program supporting China’s brutal one-child policy.""

For its evidence, the ad points to H.R. 1078, from Feb. 22, 1989. We went to the archives to check on the bill’s details.

The bill in question was called the Global Warming Prevention Act of 1989. It set national goals to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and encouraged international agreements to address global warming. It required the U.S. Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency to monitor global warming and create plans for future action. It supported stricter fuel standards for cars and alternative energy. It also sent money to developing countries to encourage practices that reduce carbon emissions. (See our fact-check of how Gingrich's statements on global warming and cap-and-trade policies have changed over the years.)

The bill had several hearings, but received unfavorable reviews from the George H.W. Bush administration and never became law.

Getting back to the ad’s specific claims, it says that Gingrich co-sponsored the bill with Nancy Pelosi. The bill’s primary sponsor was Rep. Claudine Schneider, R-R.I. It’s true that both Gingrich and Pelosi were co-sponsors. But the bill had 144 co-sponsors, roughly a third of the U.S. House of Representatives. (Gingrich was not speaker at this time; Democrats still held the majority.) Congressional records indicate Pelosi signed onto the bill the day it was introduced, while close to four months passed before Gingrich signed on as a co-sponsor. 

Next, the ad says the bill ""would have given $60 million a year to a UN program supporting China’s brutal one-child policy."" China’s one-child policy generally refers to the government’s efforts to limit population growth to one child per couple. Human rights advocates say the policy has resulted in forced sterilizations and abortions.  

The Restore our Future website says the $60 million went to the United Nations Population Fund and that President Ronald Reagan withheld funds from the program after he determined the program, which supports family planning and contraception, was supporting Chinese actions.

We won’t attempt to relitigate here whether the United Nations Population Fund supported Chinese policy, because we soon found evidence that the bill’s authors did not support those policies.

In the same section that authorizes funding, there’s this stipulation: ""None of the funds authorized by this section may be used to pay for the performance of involuntary sterilization or abortion or to coerce any person to accept family planning.""

Our ruling The ad says that Gingrich ""co-sponsored a bill with Nancy Pelosi that would have given $60 million a year to a U.N. program supporting China’s brutal one-child policy."" Actually, the bill attempted to address climate change, and a third of House members were co-sponsors.

"The EPA was asked about an environmental citation for the city landfill in Nashua, N.H. but ""didn’t know"" why it was cited.","
Excessive government regulation commanded a good portion of the NBC News-Facebook GOP debate on Meet the Press on the morning of Jan. 8, 2012.

During the debate, former Speaker Newt Gingrich was asked about his idea to replace the Environmental Protection Agency. Gingrich was quick to criticize the government agency designed to ""protect human health and the environment.""

""If you look at the EPA's record, it is increasingly radical,"" Gingrich said. ""It's increasingly imperious. It doesn't cooperate, it doesn't collaborate, and it doesn't take into account economics. The city of Nashua recently had a dump that was cited by EPA. They went down to find out, what was it being cited for? And they told them, frankly, ‘We don't know. We can't find the records that lead to this citation, and we're not exactly sure what it referenced. But it must be bad or we wouldn't have sent it out.’""

We wondered whether Gingrich’s vague classification of an EPA citation really went down that way.

First we contacted Gingrich’s campaign to find out how the speaker came up with this example, but they never got back to us.

We turned to Nashua Telegraph reporter Albert McKeon, who did a story on the city’s EPA problem last month, to see if Gingrich explained the situation accurately.

As far as ""a citation"" goes, McKeon said Gingrich framed that explanation incorrectly.

EPA didn't give the dump a citation. Rather it put it on a list, McKeon said. ""The description for the list itself is very vague. It says it doesn’t imply any organization has committed any violation, it just triggered them to be on a list of being watched.""

McKeon reported that Four Hills Landfill in Nashua had appeared on three months’ worth of the EPA’s watch lists for supposed violators of the Clean Air, Clean Water and Resource Conservation and Recovery (for hazardous waste) acts.

The purpose of the watch list, however, seemed a little fuzzy.

According to the EPA Web site, the watch list exists ""to facilitate dialogue between EPA, state and local environmental agencies on enforcement matters relating to facilities with alleged violations identified as either significant or high priority.""

Being on the watch list does not mean a facility has violated the law, according to the agency, but only that an EPA investigation, or a state or local environmental study, has led an organization to assert an unproven violation has occurred.

""Being on the watch list does not represent a higher level of concern regarding the alleged violations that were detected, but instead indicates cases requiring additional dialogue between EPA, state and local agencies -- primarily because of the length of time the alleged violation has gone unaddressed or unresolved,"" the EPA site says.

The reason Nashua’s dump made the list also was vague, McKeon said.

EPA spokesman Dave Deegan, working at the agency’s Boston offices, told McKeon a ""data lag"" on the watch list, which cited a long-ago state Department of Environmental Services action against the Nashua landfill, got Four Hills on the list. But Four Hills had had no violations in recent memory and was in compliance with environmental standards, Deegan said.

""Nashua had no idea they were on the list, and the EPA, quite frankly, didn’t either,"" McKeon said. ""(Deegan) said it was a violation in the past. He said they were not really sure what it was, but somehow it got transferred to the EPA's database, and it shouldn’t be on there because there were no problems with Nashua.""

Nashua being on the list was more a matter of not keeping records up-to-date. Nashua is not currently under any scrutiny for any violations, according to the city and the EPA.

Gingrich said the EPA cited a Nashua landfill without knowing its reason for doing so. The landfill  made a ""watch list"" for an outdated action, but it was not cited or fined for any violation by the EPA for being on the list",Mostly True,"January 8, 2012"
"Says area near proposed northern Wisconsin iron ore mine is ""15 hours away"" from where public hearing on mining was held.","
Passions run high over whether Wisconsin should allow a four-mile, 1,000-foot-deep iron ore mine near Hurley, a burg perched on the state’s northern border that brags of ""wilderness, waterfalls and wildlife.""

And passions can sometimes lead to exaggeration.

In a news release issued Jan. 5, 2012, state Rep. Kelda Helen Roys, D-Madison, complained that a hearing on speeding the approval process for new mines was held in southeastern Wisconsin -- ""15 hours away"" from the mine region.

Whoa. Stop the car.

We love to drive through Wisconsin, but it seems like after 15 hours in the car, we’d be able to get from one end of the state to the other. And back. With plenty of time for potty breaks.

To be sure, the distance question isn’t the most important issue in the mining debate. But the statement underlines how high the emotions are on the issue.

Instead of driving the distance ourselves, we asked Roy, an attorney for her evidence.

In her original news release, Roys cheered the fact that a Republican-controlled committee of the state Assembly, which is considering legislation to change the mine approval process, had changed course and decided to hold a public hearing on the measure in Hurley.

The panel had held a hearingon the bill Dec. 14, 2011 near Milwaukee, which is a major center for mining equipment manufacturing. But only after two angry Assembly Democrats scheduled their own hearing for Jan. 7, 2012 in Ashland, much closer to Hurley, did the committee set a hearing in Hurley for Jan. 11, 2012. That led the Democrats to cancel their hearing.

""I am pleased that the Assembly Committee on Jobs, Economy and Small Business has reconsidered and will now hold a public hearing in Hurley on the bill to permit a giant strip mine in northern Wisconsin,"" Roys began her news release.

""It remains unclear why the original plan was to have the only hearing in Milwaukee -- 15 hours away from those most directly affected.""

Hurley and Milwaukee -- actually, the first hearing was held at State Fair Park in suburban West Allis -- are on opposite ends of the state.

But Mapquest tells us the drive from Hurley to West Allis is about 300 miles and 5-1/2 hours by one route, or about 320 miles and 6-1/2 hours by another.

Roy’s response: We should not be measuring the distance from West Allis to Hurley, but rather to communities to the north and west of Hurley such as Ashland and Superior. They are home to ""lakes, streams, wetlands and groundwater that would be impacted"" by the mine, she said.

And we shouldn’t just measure the distance there, she said. We should measure it there and back.

In bad weather.

For residents of those communities, Roys said, ""it was indeed a 15-hour round-trip drive, through snow and inclement weather,"" to West Allis.

But that’s setting the claim on a whole new road.

Roys had complained that the West Allis hearing was held ""15 hours away from those most directly affected"" -- in other words, claiming it would take a person 15 hours to drive to the hearing from northwestern Wisconsin.

Roys also said that according to Google maps, ""it takes 14 hours and 1 minute to travel the 772 miles from Port Wing,"" which is between Ashland and Superior.

But then she goes on to acknowledge that that distance and duration would be round-trip between Port Wing and West Allis, not one way.

Indeed, Mapquest shows that the longer of two driving routes between West Allis and Port Wing is 385 miles and just over seven hours one way.  

Roys concluded her email by telling us not to ""miss the bigger point here,"" saying it was ""an extremely long and inconvenient drive"" for northwest Wisconsin residents to attend the West Allis hearing.

OK.

It is, indeed, a lengthy drive from northwestern Wisconsin to West Allis. About seven hours long, or less. Not 15",False,"January 8, 2012"
"""[Renewable energy] projects . . . get us off foreign oil and away, step by step, from these foreign entanglements that we have to get into to defend our oil supply.""","The environmental benefits of renewable energy are pretty clear, but the economics can still be muddy. Installing wind turbines and solar panels is expensive. That’s why grants, low-interest loans and tax credits are so important to the industry.

A key federal incentive came up for debate Dec. 13 on the floor of the U.S. Senate.  At issue was the future of the 1603 Treasury grant program, which was created as part of the Obama administration’s stimulus package in 2009. The program offered grants equal to 30 percent of a renewable energy project’s cost.

In what would ultimately be an unsuccessful fight to extend the grant program into 2012, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, spoke up at the hearing. In prepared remarks, he said the program is vital to the industry and that its termination would threaten jobs and projects.

""Let me just bring it home,"" Whitehouse said, as he referred to his notes. ""In Rhode Island, this [grant program] has facilitated solar panel installations on three new bank branches. The TD Bank has opened up in Barrington, in East Providence and in Johnston, Rhode Island. Those projects created jobs, they put people to work, they lowered the cost for these banks of their electrical energy, and they get us off foreign oil and away, step by step, from these foreign entanglements that we have to get into to defend our oil supply.""

That’s a lot of potential benefits from TD Bank’s projects, but we’re interested in just one of them -- that the development of solar power and other forms of renewable energy will, in the senator’s words, ""get us off foreign oil.""

PolitiFact Rhode Island assessed a similar claim last March after state Rep. Jon Brien said that a proposed waste-to-energy plant in Woonsocket was needed because ""residents are paying through the nose for electricity fueled by foreign oil."" We ruled the statement Pants on Fire because New England -- and, in fact, the nation as a whole -- gets only a tiny fraction of its electricity from oil-fired power plants.

We thought we should revisit the issue, however, because it’s a claim that comes up frequently in support of renewable energy. Whitehouse takes it a step further by framing the issue in terms of national security.

The foundation of the claim is the presumption that the United States uses oil to generate its electricity.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a government agency under the Department of Energy, in 2010, petroleum was used to generate less than 1 percent of the country’s power. More than two thirds of the electricity in the United States came from burning coal and natural gas, with much of the balance from nuclear energy and hydroelectric power. Oil is seldom used because its cost has risen so high.

As for Rhode Island, the state is part of the New England power grid in which electricity flows across state lines. In 2010, 0.4 percent of New England’s power was fueled by oil, according to a chart provided by ISO-New England, the nonprofit that manages the grid.

Natural gas plants provided the most power with a share of 32 percent, followed by nuclear stations (29 percent), dual-fuel plants that can burn natural gas and oil (12 percent), coal plants (11 percent), hydropower facilities (6 percent), other renewable energy sources (6 percent) and imported energy from New York and Canada (4 percent).

There are plants in New England that use oil. For example, one of Brayton Point Power Station’s units burns oil, generating 28 percent of the facility’s output, according to a spokesman for Dominion Generation.

But other oil-burning plants don’t operate as much these days -- in fact, many go on line only when demand is highest, say, on hot summer days when air conditioners are turned up -- because oil is so expensive and natural gas, especially, is so cheap.

In Rhode Island, of the nine significant power plants in the state, only three can use oil as well as natural gas, according to Thomas Kogut, spokesman for the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers. The rest exclusively use natural gas.

The only plant that relies entirely on oil is on Block Island and serves only about 1,000 people for most of the year. Only a fraction of 1 percent of the state’s electric generation came from oil in 2010.

But there is something else. After asking for an explanation of Whitehouse’s comments, his office did point out one way that renewable energy would lessen oil usage. Seth Larson, spokesman for the senator, referred to the New England power grid and what happens on peak demand days in the summer.

On those days, usage spikes, going from a typical load of, say, 18,000 megawatts, to 25,000 megawatts or more. In order to meet demand, oil-fired plants kick on.

Despite the high costs, these power plants come on line because there’s no alternative source of power. Larson said that if more renewable energy is developed it will reduce the need to use oil when the grid is stretched.

ISO-New England confirmed that oil is used more on days when demand for power is high. For example, on July 22, 2011, the second-highest demand day ever in the region, oil provided 14 percent of the grid’s power, according to a spokeswoman for ISO-New England. But days like that are isolated and the amount of oil used doesn’t add up to much relative to annual totals.

We also checked with Seth Kaplan, vice president of policy and climate advocacy at the Conservation Law Foundation, a regional environmental advocacy group. He said that renewable energy can make a real difference when demand for power spikes. And peak demand days, he said, typically occur on sunny days when solar power systems perform best.

Kaplan also said that there is a larger point to be made in reference to Whitehouse’s comments. Reducing the country’s reliance on oil is a process. If more sources of renewable energy come on line and if those sources are used to power electric and hybrid vehicles, then demand for oil could drop significantly. That’s because the bulk of the oil used in the United States -- 72 percent, according to the Energy Information Administration -- goes to fueling cars, trucks and planes.

Before we make our ruling, there are other issues with Whitehouse’s comments about the importance of the 1603 grant program that need to be pointed out. Along with TD Bank’s solar power systems, he cites three other projects in Rhode Island that were helped by the grants: a wind turbine at Hodges Badge Company in Portsmouth, a proposed solar farm in East Providence and three wind turbines that are set to go up at the Narragansett Bay Commission in Providence.

There are problems with some of his examples and details that need to be clarified with others.

TD Bank did indeed benefit from Treasury grants, but a spokesman for the company said the projects would have been done with or without federal assistance. In other words, the grants were not crucial to their development.

In his remarks, Whitehouse said that Hodges Badge ""has just gone completely green energy."" At the time, however, the company’s turbine had not been installed. It wasn’t put up until Jan. 4. Hodges Badge has been approved for a Treasury grant but has yet to receive the money, said Rick Hodges, president of the company.

The Narragansett Bay Commission has started construction on three wind turbines at its Fields Point facility on the Providence waterfront, but the project is receiving no money whatsoever from the Treasury program. Because it’s a quasi-public agency, it would never have qualified for the grants, said Jamie Samons, spokeswoman for the commission.

The solar farm being planned in East Providence did not receive a Treasury grant because not enough work was done on the project before the program expired. Jeanne Boyle, director of city planning, said East Providence could have qualified for a grant because it has partnered in the project with a private developer. Despite the termination of the 1603 program, the project is still in the works.

Our ruling

Whitehouse said on the Senate floor that renewable energy projects would ""get us off foreign oil"" and away from ""foreign entanglements that we have to get into to defend our oil supply.""

His comments demand further explanation.

Oil-powered plants provide a tiny amount of the power used in Rhode Island. That’s also true for New England. And the United States as a whole. For the most part, these plants only come on line when demand is highest a few times a year.

But a layperson would assume something different from the senator’s statement -- that oil is a large part of our generating supply and that alternative energy projects would substantially reduce oil consumption.

The truth is investments in solar and wind power, such as the projects the senator cites, won’t have a large effect on oil consumption",Mostly False,"January 8, 2012"
Says Newt Gingrich aligned with Nancy Pelosi on global warming.,"In a video ad, a super PAC promoting Gov. Rick Perry's presidential candidacy attacks two Perry rivals for the Republican nomination, Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney, suggesting that their records prove they are not conservatives. In the style of an old newsreel, the ad from Make Us Great Again, which was formed this year by Austin lobbyist Mike Toomey, a longtime Perry ally, highlights several criticisms that have been lobbed at the former U.S. House speaker and former Massachusetts governor. Among the charges the ad aims at Gingrich is that he joined U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., ""in support of global warming."" We take the wording to mean that Gingrich aligned with Pelosi on the issue of global warming, a pairing that has drawn renewed attention lately. A similar claim is also being heard in a television ad placed in Florida and Iowa this month by another super PAC, Restore Our Future, which is staffed and funded by supporters of Mitt Romney. The ad attacks Gingrich over ""a ton of baggage"" and includes the statement that Gingrich ""teamed with Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore on global warming."" PolitiFact National looked into that claim for a Dec. 21, 2011, fact-check. The Restore Our Future ad cites the website Newtfacts.com, which lays out a list of — you guessed it — more claims and citations about Gingrich, including this one: ""Gingrich shot an ad with Nancy Pelosi in 2008 calling for action on global warming.""

Says a trash mound on U.S. 290 is 800 feet tall.,"
Travis County commissioner candidate Richard Franklin III has a number of issues he wants to address on behalf of eastern Travis County, and one of them gets bigger every week.

At the Central Texas Democratic Forum on Nov. 29, 2011, Franklin said: ""There’s a trash mound on (U.S.) 290 that’s 800 feet tall."" Franklin later told us he’d like to see leaders use more recycling and technology to reduce or eliminate the pile.

His figure grabbed our attention, considering the tallest building in Austin is the Austonian residential tower, which is 683 feet tall. Another common reference point is Mount Bonnell, often called the highest point in Austin, which is 784 feet tall, according to the city.

But there’s an important distinction: The Austonian’s 683 feet are measured, as is normal for buildings, from base to top; Mount Bonnell’s 784 feet are measured, as is normal for geographical features, from sea level.

Franklin told us the site he meant was Republic Services’ Sunset Farms Landfill in eastern Travis County, on Giles Road north of U.S. 290 about three miles west of Manor -- and he met us on the side of the road, in view of the landfill. From there, the mound rises gradually, with a thin covering of grassy vegetation up its sides, to a cap of garbage. A bulldozer and compactor busily rumbled around the top as birds circled.

We talked with Franklin about the landfill’s height limit in relation to sea level, which touched off local debate a few years ago when Allied Waste, the predecessor to Republic Services, sought to raise the limit from 720 feet above sea level to 795 feet by filing a new permit application with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

The 2006 request was met by opposition from neighbors and the Austin City Council, according to Austin American-Statesman news stories. The council passed a resolution in May 2007 opposing Allied’s application, but later dropped its opposition after Allied agreed to close the landfill Nov. 1, 2015, the paper reported.

The Statesman reported that on Sept. 9, 2009, the state environmental commission granted Republic’s permit with the 795-foot limit. Travis County Commissioners Court records from Sept. 29, 2009, show that the commission voted to approve the permit after questioning Republic officials about the height of the landfill relative to Mount Bonnell. Project engineer Ray Shull told them that with the surrounding land at 640 feet and the cap at 795 feet, the final pile itself would max out at 155 feet above ground level -- ""not anywhere close to the tallest structure, even man-made, in Travis County.""

When we inquired, the state environmental commission reported a slightly lower base elevation for the site -- 613 feet, spokeswoman Lisa Wheeler said. Lee Kuhn, Republic’s general manager for the Austin area, separately said that ""ground level"" at the site varies from 610 feet to 640 feet above sea level.

So depending on where an observer is standing, the mound might appear to gradually rise 155 feet to 185 feet -- though only if Sunset Farms reaches the permitted height. Republic no longer expects that to happen, area president Brad Dugas told us, in part because the economic slowdown has caused area businesses and industries to produce less waste.

When we visited the landfill, it stood about 75 feet short of the limit, according to Republic officials -- so it appeared to crest 80 to 110 feet above us, depending on where we stood nearby.

Kuhn and Republic area environmental manager Michael Stewart told us the highest parts of the landfill have lately been 720 feet above sea level. As Republic continues building the hill, Stewart said, the highest part will eventually be a two-acre crest, with the rest of the mound sloping down across its 251-acre footprint.

In comparison, both Mount Bonnell's 784-foot elevation and its apparent height are greater. From the trailhead on Mount Bonnell Road, the rise from the bottom of the steps to the top of the limestone peak is 227 feet, according to Kim McKnight at Austin’s Parks and Recreation Department. And to a viewer on Lake Austin, where the water’s surface is kept about 492 feet above sea level, the peak should appear 292 feet high.

We got back in touch with Franklin, who said it matters to him how tall the pile is compared to sea level. ""It’s 800 feet above sea level, with a hundred-foot mound of trash that you can actually see,"" Franklin said.

To evaluate the statement itself, let’s look at the words again: ""There’s a trash mound on (U.S.) 290 that’s 800 feet tall."" That’s close to right when comparing the top of the pile to sea level, but we think it’s more reasonable to judge the view from ground level -- and that’s where the statement is way off",Mostly False,"December 22, 2011"
"Newt Gingrich ""teamed with Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore on global warming.""","With just two weeks until the Iowa caucuses, a new ad from a pro-Mitt Romney ""Super PAC"" is attacking Republican presidential front-runner Newt Gingrich over ""a ton of baggage"" from his past.

""Barack Obama’s plan is working: Destroy Mitt Romney, run against Newt Gingrich,"" a voice says as images of Gingrich flash on the screen, interspersed with damning headlines. ""Newt has a ton of baggage. He was fined $300,000 for ethics violations and took $1.6 million from Freddie Mac, before it helped cause the economic meltdown. Newt supports amnesty for illegal immigrants, and teamed with Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore on global warming. Maybe that’s why George Will calls him the least conservative candidate. Check the facts at NewtFacts.com.""

The ad, airing in December 2011 in Florida and Iowa, is paid for by a political action committee, which isn’t formally tied to any campaign but can spend money influencing elections. The one behind this ad is known as Restore our Future and is staffed and funded by many supporters of Mitt Romney.

It goes after the former House speaker on several issues. Here, we’re focusing on the claim that Gingrich ""teamed with Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore on global warming.""

The source

The ad cites the website Newtfacts.com, which lays out a list of -- you guessed it -- more claims and citations about Gingrich, including this one:

""Gingrich shot an ad with Nancy Pelosi in 2008 calling for action on global warming,"" followed by a link.

In that now-famous ad, Gingrich sits on a couch next to Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker of the House.

""We don’t always see eye to eye, do we, Newt?"" Pelosi says.

""No,"" Gingrich answers, ""but we do agree: Our country must take action to address climate change.""

Pelosi: ""We need cleaner forms of energy, and we need them fast.""

Gingrich: ""If enough of us demand action from our leaders, we can spark the innovation we need.""

The ad then directs viewers to the website WeCanSolveIt.org, with the final words from Pelosi, ""Together, we can do this.""

About Al Gore

The ad was created by a Gore-founded organization called the Alliance for Climate Protection that aims to spread awareness and prompt action to address climate change. It’s now known as the Climate Reality Project.

WeCanSolveIt.org is the former name of the site now called ClimateRealityProject.org.

""It is guided by one simple truth: The climate crisis is real and we know how to solve it,"" the site says. The group claims 5 million members worldwide.

In an interview with the online news show The Young Turks in December 2011, Gore mentioned that he had asked Gingrich to do the ad with Pelosi and Gingrich agreed. It was part of a larger campaign featuring ""'unlikely pairs,' who disagree on many issues but appear together to help thwart climate change,"" according to a 2008 story in the San Francisco Chronicle.

What they’re saying now

Gingrich, now tied for the lead for the Republican nomination, has big regrets that he made the ad.

The Gingrich campaign directed us to a section of its website devoted to ""answering the attacks."" In the climate change section, Gingrich is quoted as telling Fox News’ Brett Baier that making the ad with Pelosi was ""probably the dumbest single thing I’ve ever done.""

It goes on to explain that Gingrich opposes cap and trade legislation (although PolitiFact has found he supported it in the past), and he favors increased domestic oil drilling.

In the online news interview, Gore lamented Gingrich’s change of heart.

""I appreciated him agreeing to my request that he do it and I don’t want to be ungracious now. I’m grateful that he did it, and I’m sorry that he’s changed his position,"" Gore said.

Our ruling

Restore Our Future’s ad says that Gingrich ""teamed with Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore on global warming.""

In 2008, Gingrich filmed an ad with Pelosi calling for action on global warming, and he did it for Gore’s nonprofit group. Gingrich might regret it now, but the baggage is still there",True,"December 21, 2011"
"""Hydrogen sulfide . . . [was] used in the genocide of Jews in Germany. ""","
It seems like there’s no escaping the noisome fumes wafting from the Central Landfill in Johnston.

Rhode Islanders near and far have complained that the rotten-egg odor generated by decomposing organic waste is worse than ever. The concentration of hydrogen sulfide, the gas that causes the smell, has been classified by the state Department of Health at the ""nuisance"" level. And the gas certainly is a nuisance. But is it also a threat to public health?

At a recent public forum at Johnston High School, state Rep. Michael W. Chippendale claimed that it is. A very serious one, at that. After outlining the various health consequences that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists for exposure to hydrogen sulfide  -- ranging from eye irritation at low levels to convulsions and death at high levels -- the Foster Republican made a claim at the Dec. 16 meeting that was hard to ignore.

""Hydrogen sulfide is, from just a brief search of the CDC’s website, one of the nastiest components, or chemical components, of some of the nastiest things that we’ve ever encountered in the world, including -- and I don’t want to sound overly dramatic if I haven’t already -- but including the actual chemicals used in the genocide of Jews in Germany,"" said Chippendale, a member of a legislative commission appointed to look into the stink from the landfill.

No doubt it’s a dramatic statement. Any reference to the Holocaust is bound to be. But is it true?

We called Chippendale, who guessed correctly why we wanted to talk to him. He was also quick to say that he thought he misspoke.

""It appears that I may have read things out of order,"" he said.

Chippendale said he prepared some notes before the forum that included comments on the health effects of hydrogen sulfide exposure and the statement related to Nazi gas chambers. But there was supposed to be a transition between the two topics, explaining that the toxicity of hydrogen sulfide is similar to the toxicity of another gas, hydrogen cyanide.

Chippendale said that when he spoke at the meeting, he mixed up his notes, so it wasn’t until after he mentioned the Holocaust that he drew the comparison between the toxicity of hydrogen sulfide and that of hydrogen cyanide.

And that’s where the problem arose. According to the CDC web page Chippendale used as a source, ""hydrogen cyanide, under the name Zyklon B, was used as a genocidal agent by the Germans in World War II."" Again, that’s hydrogen cyanide, not hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide has been found at the landfill; hydrogen cyanide has not.

We decided to do more research on hydrogen sulfide and its history. Was it ever used by the Germans in World War II or as a chemical weapon by anyone else? And is its toxicity really comparable to hydrogen cyanide?

Our first stop was the CDC website that Chippendale went to. In all the documents on hydrogen sulfide on the site, we found no reference to the Germans using the gas in World War II.

We then contacted Stephen L. Morgan, a chemistry professor at the University of South Carolina who has taught courses on the history of chemical warfare. His reaction to Chippendale’s statement at the forum?

""I think he’s confused,"" he said.

Morgan found two references to hydrogen sulfide’s use as a chemical weapon in World War I, but not in World War II.

But that doesn’t mean that the gas can’t be dangerous under certain conditions.

According to the CDC, hydrogen sulfide ""naturally occurs in the gases from volcanoes, sulfur springs, undersea vents, swamps and stagnant bodies of water and in crude petroleum and natural gas."" It also results from the decomposition of organic matter and can be found at wastewater treatment plants, landfills, slaughterhouses, petroleum refineries and other industrial facilities.

When levels are high enough, it can cause illness and, in some instances, death. According to the Rhode Island Department of Health, levels higher than 10 parts per million are unhealthy. Levels higher than 100 parts per million can trigger evacuation. The ""Handbook of Environmental Data on Organic Chemicals"" by Karel Verschueren says immediate death results from a level higher than 800 parts per million.

The CDC lists a number of incidents in which people have died from exposure to high levels of hydrogen sulfide. In fact, in 2001, a fisherman died on a Rhode Island boat and two others were injured after breathing in hydrogen sulfide inside the vessel’s hold.

The gas concentrations measured during visits to neighborhoods near the Central Landfill and at a fixed monitoring station at Wood Lake Park in Johnston have so far been far less than 1 part per million, according to Barbara Morin, supervising environmental scientist at the state Department of Environmental Management.

""It’s not at a level that’s going to poison anybody,"" she said.

Our ruling

There’s no question that in confined conditions and at extremely high concentrations hydrogen sulfide can be dangerous. There are recorded instances of people dying from exposure to the gas. But we could find no record of the Germans using it in their gas chambers during World War II.

Rep. Chippendale made a statement that was sure to draw attention.

""My sole intent was to make the point and drive it home with as strong a use of terms as I possibly could while remaining factually accurate,"" he told us.

But he wasn’t accurate. Give him credit for admitting that without much fuss. Nevertheless, we should all be more careful when trying to make a connection to something as emotionally charged as the Holocaust",False,"December 21, 2011"
Says there have been no cases of wolves killing people in Rocky Mountain states.,"
The story of OR-7, the young gray wolf who has settled in southwest Oregon after a 750-mile trek, has captured headlines around the world. He’s also reignited local debates about the place for wolves in rural communities, and their potential threat to people and livestock.

In a recent article in The Oregonian, Michelle Dennehy, a spokeswoman for the state’s Department of Fish and Wildlife, spoke some about those risks.

""Wolves have attacked and killed people in Canada and Alaska,"" Dennehy told The Oregonian. ""It is extremely rare and has never happened in the Rocky Mountain states, but we advise people to keep your distance from wolves and any wild animals.""

Oregon is home to an estimated 24 wolves, a small population. But a 2010 reportby the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service puts the number of wolves in the Northern Rocky Mountain population (which includes Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, and the eastern one-third of Washington and Oregon) at more than 1,650.

This got us wondering whether it could be true that there have been no documented cases of run-ins with wolves in that fairly large area. Plus, we’re always looking for a change of pace.

We started where we always start: the source. Dennehy pointed us to a 2002 report from the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research called ""The fear of wolves: A review of wolf attacks on humans.""

Because ""the vast majority"" of global wolf research happens in North America, the report says, wolf attacks in Canada and the U.S. have been extremely well documented. That documentation -- and the fact that attacks are so rare -- allowed the authors to detail every attack in the past century.

All told, the study’s authors found 18 wolf attacks in North America -- 12 in Canada and six in the U.S. Of the attacks in the U.S., four occurred in Alaska (as did an unspecified number of small incidents along a road where truckers had taken to feeding the wolves) and two in Minnesota, in which the victims weren’t injured. Two of the attacks in Alaska left the victim dead of rabies. Both of those happened in the 1940s.

Dennehy also sent us a news clip from a paper up in Saskatchewan that detailed the 2005 deathof a young Ontario student who was on a walk near a Saskatchewan mining camp when he was attacked and killed. A sad story to be sure, but one that happened a ways away from the Rocky Mountains.

We try to be thorough, so we also placed a call to the International Wolf Center, an organization that tries to advance the survival of wolves through education.

We spoke to Jess Edberg, who is based in Ely, Minnesota. Minnesota has the most robust wolf population outside of Alaska.

""Overall, in North America and around the world, a wolf attack on humans is very rare,"" Edberg said. ""In the lower 48, we haven't had any attacks on humans.""
She added that many of the attacks that do occur often involve sick animals or animals who had been fed or allowed to become accustomed to humans.

Edberg did point out the Alaska Department of Fish and Game had recently concluded that a woman found dead in 2010 on the Alaska Peninsula was killed by wolves.

Finally, she sent us looking for two studies on wolves. One report, which shared an author with the first Norwegian report, looked at Scandinaviaand found that over the past 300 years, 94 people have been killed by wolves. All of those cases, the report found, were before 1882 and most were children under the age of 12.

The second, more pertinent report, done in 2002, by Mark E McNay for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game looked at wolf attacks in Alaska and Canada and found that ""despite (a) large and widely distributed wolf population, no human deaths have been attributed to wild, healthy wolves since at least 1900, and biting incidents or bluff charges are rare enough to warrant publication in scientific journals.""

Of course, that report was published before the two deaths we mentioned above.

Still, the reports support Dennehy and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. There’s no evidence that a wolf has attacked a human in the Rocky Mountain states, let alone killed one",True,"December 16, 2011"
"""In this country … we have more natural gas than Saudi Arabia has oil.""","
Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman says that protecting the environment while securing new sources of energy and creating jobs will be a ""balancing act"" for the next president.

""The job we've got to undertake as American people is to fuel our future,"" Huntsman said in a Republican presidential debate in Iowa on Dec. 15, 2011.

Where does he want to find the fuel? Right here at home.

Huntsman frequently decries U.S. dependence on foreign oil while trumpeting the need for energy independence. To support his point, in the debate he cited a statistic that ""in this country … we have more natural gas than Saudi Arabia has oil.""

Our New Hampshire team checked this exact claim before and found that Huntsman is comparing apples and oranges and getting it wrong.

Complex math

PolitiFact's New Hampshire team contacted the U.S. Energy Information Administration to break down the issue, which involves comparing energy sources that are measured differently. Oil supplies are calculated in barrels, while natural gas supplies are calculated in cubic feet. And the two fuels have different energy content, which means it takes still more math to compare them.
   
Converting the energy content into the standard measure British thermal units, 1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas is equivalent to 165 million barrels of crude oil, according to Steven Grape, an EIA expert in the Office of Oil, Gas, and Coal Supply Statistics.
   
In addition, there are two ways to look at how much of each resource is available. One is to look at proved reserves -- those that are likely to be developed under current economic and operating conditions.
   
Another, more uncertain approach is to look at technically recoverable resources. These are resources that could be developed using current exploration and production technology, without regard to cost.
   
Starting with proved reserves, Saudi Arabia has 24 percent of the world’s proved reserves of crude oil, or about 264 billion barrels, Grape said. The U.S. proved reserves of natural gas are 284 trillion cubic feet. Punch those figures into the equation, and U.S. proved reserves are equal in energy content to about 46.8 billion barrels of oil -- considerably less than Saudi Arabia's proved reserves of oil.
   
Now let’s look at the technically recoverable figures. Resource estimates for Saudi Arabia are thought to be as high as 700 billion barrels of crude oil, and the technically recoverable resource estimate for the United States is about 2,500 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, which is equivalent to 412.5 billion barrels of oil.

Again, that's much less than the 700 billion barrel estimate for Saudi Arabia.

Current production
   
Huntsman’s claim is correct only if taken to be referring to production. ""We don’t have more natural gas in this country than Saudi Arabia has oil, but we produce more natural gas in this country per year than Saudi Arabia produces oil,"" Grape said.
   
The U.S. produces the equivalent of 12.14 million barrels per day, compared with Saudi Arabia's 9.8 million barrels of oil per day, Grape said.

But Huntsman didn’t say we ""produce"" more natural gas than Saudi Arabia produces oil. He said we ""have"" more.

Our ruling

In the debate, Huntsman said, ""we have more natural gas than Saudi Arabia has oil.""

By two of the three measures to consider that claim, Huntsman is off base. Looking at proved resources, Saudi Arabia’s oil reserves are far larger than U.S. natural gas reserves. Considering technically recoverable resources, Saudi Arabia is still the front runner. Only when comparing current production levels does Huntsman’s statistic hold up. But Huntsman didn’t refer to production",Mostly False,"December 16, 2011"
"""The study of the Savannah River Estuary . . . clearly demonstrates the project can be constructed and [environmental] impacts will be mitigated.""","
Congress cleared the way for Georgia to transform Savannah’s harbor into the port of the future way back in 1999. Then old-fashioned Mother Nature had her say.

Planners found that deepening the port to fit modern megaships will destroy some of the delicate wetlands nearby. More than a decade later, they’re still mulling over what to do about it.

The Georgia Ports Authority, which is behind the dredging, thinks there’s little doubt planners can make it work. Executive Director Curtis Foltz wrote in an op-ed that appeared in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that it’s time to push ahead.

""The study of the Savannah River Estuary — the most comprehensive in history — clearly demonstrates the project can be constructed and impacts will be mitigated,"" Foltz said.

This claim puzzled the Truth-O-Meter team. If a study ""clearly demonstrates"" that port dredgers can address the environmental concerns, what’s the holdup?

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is the federal agency in charge of studying improvements to harbors and their effects. The agency wrote the study Foltz mentioned.

The port is next door to the Savannah National Wildlife Refuge, which is home to 10 threatened or endangered species, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Dredging will affect the Savannah River estuary, a type of habitat where fresh water mixes with salty ocean water. A number of species can’t reproduce without estuaries.

The corps’ ""Tier II Environmental Impact Statement for the Savannah Harbor Expansion"" was released in draft form for public comment in November 2010,  and details how port planners aim to ease the damage to the environment that dredging will cause.

The heads of several federal departments must sign off on the corps’ assessment before the dredging begins, and they haven’t done so yet.

We found that while the corps is optimistic that it can mitigate the impacts of the dredging, other arms of the federal government and an independent analysis found weaknesses in the plan.  

For the sake of simplicity, we’ll focus on two of the most heavily contested issues in this debate: preserving the endangered shortnose sturgeon, and dealing with the loss of the waterway’s dissolved oxygen, which fish and other marine life need to survive.  

The endangered shortnose sturgeon is a 3-foot-long fish with a bony plate of armor and an upturned nose. Dredging the port will destroy a significant percentage of its habitat, according to the environmental impact study, so the corps proposed to expand it by building a ""fishway.""

This passage would connect shortnose sturgeon to other portions of the river where they can thrive. A dam currently blocks the route.   

The corps’ draft environmental study concluded that the impacts on the fish ""will be mitigated,"" but the National Marine Fisheries Service raised objections to the corps two months after the draft’s release.

As designed, the proposed passage was ""not likely to be successful in passing sturgeon to justify its use"" to make up for habitat destruction, according to a letter the Fisheries Service sent to the corps.   

The two agencies worked out changes to the fishway. Last month, the Fisheries Service said the corps’ plan is ""not likely to jeopardize"" the shortnose sturgeon and other species, so long as the corps closely monitors the effort and meets other conditions.

Now, on to dissolved oxygen, which is what fish breathe by filtering water through their gills. Researchers expect the port’s expansion to lower the amount of dissolved oxygen in crucial parts of the harbor, so the corps proposed that they install equipment that will put oxygen back in.  

The National Marine Fisheries Service objected in a January letter to the corps. They said the equipment might not provide enough oxygen, and called it a ""very risky operation with a high degree of uncertainty.""

But after a few months of discussion, they sent a letter in November saying that they think the corps plan will adequately protect the fish. This letter included plans to closely monitor oxygen levels and make immediate changes if problems arise.

The U.S. Department of the Interior’s Fish and Wildlife Service also acknowledged that researchers disagree over whether the oxygen system will work. They told PolitiFact Georgia in a recent statement that they’re working on a plan to monitor the equipment when it’s installed to ensure it’s effective.

In February, a nonprofit group hired by the federal government to review the corps’ plans raised a different critique. The group said the oxygen injection system might release too much into certain areas of the harbor. This could have ""lethal impacts"" to fish, especially threatened and endangered species, the group’s report said.   

None of these comments said the problems are impossible to fix. They do question whether the corps plan will fall short of its goal.

We think it’s fair to say that while the corps’ environmental report may have concluded that dredgers can mitigate the environmental problems they would cause, as Foltz stated, critiques by other federal agencies and an independent study muddy the waters.

Foltz should have acknowledged their reservations",Half True,"December 14, 2011"
"""I never favored cap and trade.""","Three years ago, Newt Gingrich went on television, cozied up to Nancy Pelosi and preached the need to respond to global warming. ""We do agree our country must take action to address climate change,"" Gingrich said from a couch, which was oddly positioned in front of the U.S. Capitol. What seemed like genuine, bipartisan PR in 2008 now looks like conservative heresy by the current frontrunner in the Republican presidential race. Gingrich now calls that TV ad the ""dumbest single thing"" he’s ever done and insists his policy stance on the environment passes all conservative muster. ""If you notice, I never favored cap and trade,"" he said in a candidate forum in New York City on Dec. 3, 2011. Really? Never? We did a little digging and it didn't take long to find that Gingrich has been inconsistent and has at times advocated cap and trade legislation when combined with other approaches. Origins of cap and trade Cap and trade legislation seeks to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and other greenhouse gas sources by setting caps on the amount of pollutants a plant can spew into the air. Companies that come in below their cap are then allowed to sell their emission credits to other companies that need them. Supporters say the approach provides economic incentives to reduce pollution and innovate. Critics deride it as an energy tax and say it increases costs for everyone. The approach was originally employed to curb the pollutants that cause acid rain in the early 1990s. President George H.W. Bush championed it, with the support of both Democrats and Republicans in Congress -- including, yes, Newt Gingrich. The idea was to provide incentives to reduce acid rain through a marketplace approach. As scientists found more evidence of climate change, cap and trade became a popular solution. ""It embodied freedom from the command and control regulation that can be so confining. It was seen as a real step in the right direction for that reason by a lot of Republicans,"" said Eric Pooley, a former journalist and author of the 2010 book The Climate War who is now a senior vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund. In 2008, it was one of the few areas of common ground for Barack Obama and John McCain. Both acknowledged climate change and favored carbon caps. But then several factors combined to change the dynamic, Pooley said. The recession made it hard to talk about any solution that had a price tag attached, and Republicans dug in against Obama's main initiatives. Plus, Pooley said, the rise of the tea party movement put pressure on moderate Republicans, especially those in the House who voted in favor of a cap and trade bill in 2009 that demanded major emissions cuts. The bill died in the Senate. Today, most Republicans in Congress are staunchly against cap and trade. Gingrich praises cap and trade  But contrary to his claim this week, Gingrich has not been consistent on the issue. Four years ago, he was singing the praises of cap and trade -- as long as tax incentives were included in new laws. On Feb. 15, 2007, Gingrich went on the PBS show Frontline and championed cap and trade. Asked if he supported George W. Bush’s campaign pledge in 2000 to set mandatory carbon caps, Gingrich responded: ""I think if you have mandatory carbon caps combined with a trading system, much like we did with sulfur, and if you have a tax-incentive program for investing in the solutions, that there's a package there that's very, very good. And frankly, it's something I would strongly support."" he said. He then went on to criticize Bush for backing off the pledge. ""If he had instituted a regime that combined three things I just said -- mandatory caps, a trading system inside the caps, as we have with clean air, and a tax incentive to be able to invest in the new technology and to be able to produce the new technology -- I think we would be much better off than we are in the current situation,"" Gingrich said. Two months later, Gingrich took part in a debate with Democratic Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts about environmental matters. Gingrich was slightly less gung-ho about cap and trade than he had been on PBS, but his message of ""urgent need for action"" on environmental dangers was clear. ""We should address it and we should address it very actively,"" he said in the debate, citing a UN report documenting the earth’s rising temperatures. ""The … consensus is that humans have contributed to that. I don't think there's any consensus that we are the only contribution, but there is a clear agreement that human activity has helped increase the level of warmness."" On cap and trade, Gingrich said he doubted whether the approach would be as effective with carbon dioxide emissions as it had been with sulfur pollution, which in his view is easier to measure. ""And cap-and-trade, by the way, for sulfuric acid and acid rain -- which I voted for and helped pass as the Republican whip -- was a very definable number of plants. A carbon cap in trade, if it's universal, is enormously complicated and transfers an amazing amount of power to a Washington bureaucracy and will create, inevitably, winners and losers and will become politicized overnight."" He said he favored tax incentives to reduce carbon emissions but added, ""I'm not automatically saying that coercion and bureaucracy isn't an answer. I just don't think it's as positive and as creative an answer as market incentives in terms of getting the kind of change we want."" Then, a bigger shift By 2008, Gingrich was firmly against cap and trade. Pooley called it Gingrich’s ""signature reading of the American political moment."" He started talking not about addressing climate change but about increasing oil drilling domestically. In April of 2009, Gingrich took his cap and trade opposition to a House committee hearing, testifying against the bill that would have set carbon emission caps. Said Gingrich: ""An energy tax punishes senior citizens. It punishes rural Americans. If you use electricity it punishes you; if you use heating oil it punishes you; if you use gasoline it punishes you. This bill will increase your cost of living and may kill your job.""   In that same hearing, however, he left the door open to a law that would apply cap and trade, combined with tax incentives and regulatory changes, to the biggest polluting sites.   ""Now, if you want to write a bill that covers the 2,000 most polluting places and say, fine, those 2,000 are part of cap and trade, I'd be glad to look at it,"" he told the House committee. At the 2011 candidate forum, Gingrich cited this testimony in his opposition to cap and trade. A section of Gingrich’s campaign website devoted to ""setting the record straight"" has this to say on the controversy: Gingrich ""absolutely opposes ‘cap and trade’ as well as any system of taxing carbon emissions"" and on global warming itself and humanity’s responsibility, the website says ""Newt has noted there is no settled scientific conclusion."" Our ruling Gingrich, as a presidential candidate in 2011, declared, ""I never favored cap and trade."" But we found solid evidence he did, with the condition that carbon caps be combined with tax incentives to encourage energy companies to innovate. He told Frontline a cap and trade system combined with tax incentives is ""something I would strongly support,"" and even took a hindsight-is-20/20 stance, saying the country ""would be much better off"" if cap and trade had been instituted. That’s favoring it",False,"December 7, 2011"
"Sen. Sherrod Brown ""has chosen to side with Washington bureaucrats and fringe extremists in the attacks on our natural resources.""","
Note to Athens, Ohio, residents: Your mayor and other elected officials in your part of Ohio are fringe extremists.

You may disagree with that statement, but then, you probably support the Washington bureaucrats who halted leasing in the Wayne National Forest for fracking. What’s that? It wasn’t a Washington bureaucrat who made that decision but, rather, a forester in Ohio?

Well, as Emily Litella used to say on Saturday Night Live: Never mind.

With apologies to the late Gilda Radner, these claims about fringe elements and Washington bureaucrats owe themselves to Josh Mandel, the Ohio treasurer. Mandel, a Republican now running for U.S. Senate, criticized incumbent U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat,  after Brown told Ohio Public Radio on Nov. 28 that he supports a local decision to remove 3,302 acres of national forest in southeast Ohio from a federal auction of land for oil and gas exploration.

The land is in a part of the state where hydraulic fracking could yield big dividends, although there are a lot of uncertainties. Fracking is shorthand for fracturing, and it involves drilling deep into the ground and injecting water, sand and chemicals at high pressure to fracture the shale and release the natural gas or oil trapped there. Geologists and energy industry officials say a potential windfall of gas lies in the Utica shale formation, and to a lesser extent the Marcellus shale, beneath eastern Ohio.

Fracking has its critics, including those who say the chemicals used in the process might contaminate groundwater. A number of experts, including the geologists at the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, say fracking is safe and that human error, the real cause of problems, can be avoided with proper state regulation.

We mention that because Anne Carey, supervisor of the Wayne National Forest, was concerned about fracking’s impact on the Wayne National Forest. She recommended that the forest be removed from the Dec. 7 federal auction until there could be further review. That could take up to six months, and will deal with fracking’s effect on forest land, not groundwater. A Wayne National Forest already allows for other drilling -- and there are 1,300 shallow wells there -- but fracking could require removing far more trees, according to The Columbus Dispatch.

In an interview, Brown said he supported Carey’s decision, noting that numerous local officials had concerns about fracking in the area.

Mandel then criticized Brown.

In a Dec. 2, 2011, column Mandel wrote in The Wall Street Journal, the treasurer said: ""Adding to the public outrage here is the position taken by Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, who this week announced his support of the federal government's job-killing decision. Even though the vilification of Ohio's abundant coal, oil and gas disproportionately hurts jobs and energy prices here, Mr. Brown has chosen to side with Washington bureaucrats and fringe extremists in the attacks on our natural resources.""

PolitiFact Ohio decided to look at the last part of his claim; that Brown has chosen to side with bureaucrats and fringe extremists.

We started with the part about ""Washington bureaucrats.""

Carey, who made the recommendation, told The Athens News that her entire career with the Forest Service ""has been at the local level.""

Jane Cliff, the media officer for the U.S. Forest Service’s eastern region, headquartered in Milwaukee, told us that Chuck Myers, the region’s forester, accepted it and the Wayne National Forest was removed from the auction. Myers also is based in Milwaukee.

As for the ""fringe extremists,"" among the people who wanted to apply the brakes in the Wayne National Forest were Roderick McDavis, president of Ohio University; the Athens County commissioners, and Athens Mayor Paul Wiehl.

Wiehl won re-election recently in what could be called a landslide, getting 71 percent of the vote, according to The Athens News. Granted, Athens is a university town with a lot of Democrats, and Wiehl wants to keep fracking out of the city. But so did his Republican opponent, according to news coverage.

Wiehl told PolitiFact Ohio his concern is that there is a gold rush-like frenzy to frack because of the potential for prosperity, without what he considers to be enough caution. An accident in the forest near the Hocking River basin could affect Athens’ drinking water.

""I don’t consider myself to be fringe-like,"" he said. ""I consider myself to be cautious or a little bit conservative as to how this is done.""

There has been a lot of debate about this issue in southeast Ohio. Mandel has tapped into that, with his spokesman calling this ""a defining  issue over the next year"" and Mandel saying that the fracking boom represents a way out of economic stagnation.

But does the removal of acreage in Wayne National Forest represent a real setback to this boom? We asked Tom Stewart, executive vice president of the Ohio Oil and Gas Association, how much land in the scheme of Ohio fracking this represents.

""The bulk of eastern Ohio is leased,"" he said. ""I don’t know what that acreage would be. It would be a huge number.""

In other words, fracking is going on in so many other places that the Wayne acreage represents a mere blip. The Plain Dealer and other newspapers have reported that one company alone, Oklahoma-based Chesapeake Energy, has leased 1.5 million acres in Ohio so it can drill 12,000 wells. And The Plain Dealer reported in October that gas and oil-rich shale may lie under 5 million acres of rural Ohio landscape.

That compares with 3,302 acres that the Wayne has taken off the table for now.

So let’s recap:

Josh Mandel is all for fracking if it follows safe, acceptable practices. He sees it as a potentially huge economic win for Ohio. Sherrod Brown says he, too, is for fracking, but he says he understands the concerns of the Wayne National Forest supervisor, the mayor of Athens, the county commissioners and the university president, and he supports the decision for a delay to allow further study.

It would be easy to just say that Brown’s support for fracking comes with more qualifications, or that he deferred to the local officials. It would be true. But it would lack outrage, and outrage, apparently, is what Mandel was going for. He said that Brown sided with ""fringe extremists,"" when these individuals happen to be a mayor, county commissioners and a state university president. And Mandel said Brown sided with ""Washington bureaucrats,"" when the woman making the call was in Ohio. Her boss who signed off was in Wisconsin.

Political criticism is fair game. But it’s a stretch to equate a national forest supervisor in Southeast Ohio and her boss in Wisconsin as Washington bureaucrats",False Pants on Fire,"December 7, 2011"
Says Mitt Romney has said different things about whether global warming is caused by humans,"Global warming has become a hot potato, at least for Republican presidential candidates.

We’ve seen candidates for the Republican nomination question whether there’s scientific consensus on climate change, but those statements are at odds with the facts. We’ve found the scientific consensus is still firmly on the side of a warming planet. We looked at Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s statement that scientists are ""questioning the original idea that man-made global warming is what is causing the climate to change. … (It is) more and more being put into question."" We rated that False.

The Democratic National Committee recently attacked Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, for flip-flopping on whether he believes climate change was real. (It also accused him of flip-flopping on a number of other issues; see all of our fact-checks of their claims here.)

In a four-minute web ad, the DNC spliced together video of Romney first saying, ""Well, I believe the world is getting warmer … I believe that humans contribute to that.""

And then saying, ""My view is that we don’t know what’s causing climate change on this planet.""

We decided to check into whether Romney has changed his views or not.

Romney’s comments, take 1

Romney’s first comments were from a town hall in New Hampshire in June 2011. A voter asked if he thought climate change existed and was caused by human activity, noting that scientific evidence showed that to be the case.

Here’s part of Romney’s answer (watch the exchange on C-SPAN starting at the 21:00 mark):

""I don't speak for the scientific community, of course. But I believe the world is getting warmer. I can't prove that, but I believe based on what I read that the world is getting warmer. And number two, I believe that humans contribute to that. I don’t know how much our contribution is to that, because I know there have been periods of greater heat and warmth in the past, but I believe that we contribute to that. So I think it's important for us to reduce our emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases that may well be significant contributors to the climate change and the global warming that you're seeing.""

Romney then suggested that the U.S. should reduce its dependence on foreign oil and use more domestically produced natural gas and nuclear energy. And he said some carbon-emitting forms of energy would still have to be used.

Romney also said he opposed the United States unilaterally adopting a cap-and-trade plan if other countries weren’t taking similar steps to reduce greenhouse emissions. For background, a cap-and-trade plan would require industry to pay for their carbon emissions with new permit fees. There would be a limited amount of permits (the ""cap""), but companies would be able to buy and sell the permits among themselves (the ""trade"").

Romney also mentioned that he wrote about energy policy in his book, No Apology. In that book, he wrote, ""I believe that climate change is occurring. The reduction in the size of global ice caps is hard to ignore. I also believe that human activity is a contributing factor.""

He also wrote that cap-and-trade was ""an energy tax, disguised in the sheep’s clothing of market terminology. And it is an energy tax that would have little or no effect on global warming.""

Romney’s comments, take 2

Romney’s second set of comments came at a campaign event in Pittsburgh, Pa., a few months later. His comments were videotaped and posted to a blog called New Hampshire 2012: Green and promoted by Think Progress.

In this case, a voter asked Romney, ""What is your position on man-made global warming and would you reject legislation, such as cap and trade, which is based on the idea of man-made global warming?""

Romney first said he was opposed to cap-and-trade, then said this:

""My view is that we don’t know what’s causing climate change on this planet. And the idea of spending trillions and trillions of dollars to try to reduce CO2 emissions is not the right course for us. My view with regards to energy policy is pretty straightforward. I want us to become energy secure and independent of the oil cartels. And that means let’s aggressively develop our oil, our gas, our coal, our nuclear power.""

Much of Romney’s underlying policy-- reduce foreign oil dependence; increase the use of natural gas and nuclear power; oppose cap-and-trade  -- remained the same in both contexts. In a few cases, he even uses the same phrasing to describe the policies.

But his comments about the cause of global warming did change markedly.

After Romney’s remarks were widely reported, Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul told the Boston Globe that Romney was not flip-flopping: ""This is ridiculous,"" she said in a statement. ""Governor Romney’s view on climate change has not changed. He believes it’s occurring, and that human activity contributes to it, but he doesn’t know to what extent. He opposes cap and trade, and he refused to sign such a plan when he was governor.""

We will be watching to see if Romney is asked again about his thoughts on global warming; we were unable to find any other remarks since then about whether he thought human beings contribute to global warming or not.

Our ruling

In June 2011, Romney said he believed ""the world is getting warmer"" and that ""humans contribute to that."" In October 2011, Romney said that ""we don’t know what’s causing climate change on this planet.""

Interestingly, in spite of his comments on the causes of climate change, Romney outlined the same set of energy policies: in favor of more natural gas and nuclear power; against foreign oil; for the continued use of domestic oil; against a cap-and-trade plan.

Because he didn’t articulate any change of policy, we find Romney’s comments on the causes of climate change perplexing, and we would be interested in hearing him answer pointed questions on the matter. His spokeswoman says the two statements are consistent. But the videos clearly shows that he said different things on the causes of climate change to different audiences, and we believe Romney is savvy enough to know the difference between suggesting a human role in climate change and leaving it out",Mostly True,"November 30, 2011"
"In Rhode Island, ""only 5 percent of ozone pollution is from local or in-state sources. . . Ninety-five percent comes from outside of our borders, particularly the Midwest.""","
Pollution doesn't respect state boundaries. That was an underlying theme when the U.S. Senate debated whether to kill an Environmental Protection Agency rule that requires 27 Eastern states to curb smog and pollution that affect states downwind. 
Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who sponsored the proposal to eliminate the rules, characterized them as ""job-killing regulations."" 
Rhode Island Democrat Jack Reed was one of the senators who argued for keeping them in place. He used an economic argument, saying that electric rates in other states are lower because polluters there simply send their dirty air high into the skies, forcing downwind states to spend extra on antipollution equipment when they generate their power or drive their automobiles.

That increases energy costs here, which drives up unemployment, Reed said. ""We're effectively subsidizing lower electricity rates in parts of this country that are taking jobs from Rhode Island.""

""Now in Rhode Island specifically, only 5 percent of ozone pollution is from local or in-state sources. Five percent. Ninety-five percent comes from outside of our borders, particularly the Midwest,"" Reed said.

The Paul proposal was ultimately defeated 41-56, mostly along party lines.

But we wondered whether the amount of imported ozone pollution is really that high.

Ozone is a form of super-oxygen, made up of three oxygen atoms. Normal, less-reactive, oxygen has two. High in the atmosphere, ozone is good. It acts as a natural sunscreen that shields us from damaging ultraviolet rays, which explains the concern over the ""ozone hole"" when it was growing in the Antarctic. But ozone near the ground is bad, a pollutant that causes breathing problems.

But is 95 percent of it blown in from other states?

The issue is complicated because the chemistry is complicated. Individual ozone molecules don't last long. They're generated by the right combination of sunlight, carbon-containing gasses (often called volatile organic compounds) and nitrogen-based pollutants (often called oxides of nitrogen or NOx). And the same pollutants that create it can, under the right conditions, destroy it.

""Consider the distribution of ozone around a source of NOx such as the interstate highway,"" said John Merrill, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Rhode Island. ""On a day when the sun is shining, if you go a mile or two downwind, there's usually less ozone because the NOx emitted by the cars on the highway actually destroys ozone because there is way too much NOx relative to hydrocarbons. But if you go 20 miles downwind, there's still a little bit of NOx left and now it's producing ozone instead of destroying ozone.""

When we asked Reed's office about the senator's claim, spokesman Chip Unruh sent us a 384-page technical document, released by the EPA in 1998, that deals with NOx emissions. It used wind data to see where that pollution came from, tracing it backward in time.

It reports that during high-pollution events, 5 percent of Rhode Island's dirty air comes from within the state and 95 percent derives from upwind states. Merrill said those are the most up-to-date numbers he could find. Those are the numbers Reed used.

Although the EPA report doesn't look at ozone directly and it's not accurate to equate NOx to ozone, Merrill said the percentages for ozone are pretty close because the pollutants follow the same wind-driven path. ""It's the most important variable factor, other than meteorological factors.""

So a cloud of ozone that grows on warm sunny days can migrate hundreds of miles before the sun goes down and the cloud starts to break down.

So which states are giving us all this pollution?

Reed said the primary source of the ozone is the Midwest.

Although Ohio, Michigan and some states to their west generate air pollution that drifts beyond their borders, the EPA report cited by Reed's office shows that the polluters that cause our ozone problems are much closer to home.

New Jersey is responsible for 30 percent of our air pollution; New York accounts for 24 percent, followed by Pennsylvania (12 percent) and Virginia (7 percent). Midwestern states such as Ohio, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan contribute no more than 11 percent.

""It follows the I-95 corridor,"" said Lenny Giuliano, an air quality specialist at the state Department of Environmental Management. ""The wind has got to be in the right direction for us to get it.""

Our ruling

Jack Reed said 95 percent of Rhode Island's ozone pollution comes from outside the state, and most of it is imported from the Midwest.

The percentages come from a 13-year-old EPA report -- the most recent available -- that looks at, not ozone directly, but the pollutants that generate ozone under the right conditions.

But the pollution sent into the air by smokestacks in the Midwest makes up only a small fraction of the pollution coming into Rhode Island, an amount overwhelmed by the dirty air coming from New York and New Jersey",Half True,"November 27, 2011"
"Solyndra ""had robots that whistled Disney songs. I'm not kidding.""","
When a presidential candidate says a controversial solar factory had robots that whistled Disney songs, then says, ""I'm not kidding,"" we just can't resist. Really? 

We've checked other recent claims about Solyndra, the once-hot solar panel manufacturer that won $535 million in federal loan guarantees, then collapsed into bankruptcy court this year. But only this one had us humming a merry tune.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who is seeking the Republican nomination, talked about the robots to distinguish between his private sector experience and government largesse in a recent speech to conservatives in Washington. 
The Disney reference planted an irresistible image of Snow White's dwarfs stacking solar panels. We asked Romney's campaign for evidence for his claim.

Spokesman Ryan Williams provided us with a Bloomberg article from Sept. 28, 2011: ""Solyndra plant had whistling robots, spa showers.""

It began: 
Later in the story were more robot details.   
We chatted with Pierce, the facilities manager, who now works at a California university, and Myron Moreno, Solyndra's director of automation, who's since picked up a job at another solar company.

They explained that at an automated plant like Solyndra's, when stacks of panels need to be moved around the factory, a machine called an ""automated guided vehicle"" does the work. It's basically a driverless forklift. Just like a forklift, it sounds an alarm when it moves to alert workers to stay out of the way. (You can see them at work in this Solyndra video.)

Versions of the vehicles have been around since the 1950s, according to the American Society of Safety Engineers. Their main benefit is that they reduce labor costs.

But the incessant beep-beep-beeping can drive workers nuts — and sometimes they tune it out, presenting a safety hazard. So vehicle makers have experimented with other sounds to make sure the alarms get heard. For example, melodies.

Moreno said the new factory used about 10 automated guided vehicles from equipment manufacturers Murata and Savant, in two sizes. One carried about 1,000 pounds, the other about 2,000 pounds.

The Japanese Murata vehicles came preloaded with a beeping noise and music. The other machines Solyndra equipped with an alarm box that included music.

""They gave you a menu, so we had each one playing a different medley,"" Moreno said. ""Any time they're moving, it's preferable to have some music versus the alarming sound. I've been in factories all over the U.S., and that's the typical thing.""

Of course, even the wordless music had its downside: Songs could get stuck in your head, Moreno said. So they avoided the better-known movie soundtracks, like E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial and Raiders of the Lost Ark, he said. 

It was a relief, Moreno said, that some of the tunes were Japanese folk songs.

""Those weren't too bad, because nobody knew what those were,"" Moreno said.

What about Disney songs? Neither Pierce or Moreno specifically recalled any.

Our ruling

We were heartened that Romney was able to quickly provide a source for his information about Solyndra's factory. But as an example of wasteful spending, ""robots that whistled Disney songs,"" doesn't quite hold up. Automated guided vehicles are common in warehouses and factories, as a labor-saving device. Some of them come preloaded with melodies as an alternative to beep-beep-beep — to boost workers' attention to them, and thus safety. The Solyndra vehicles may have played some Disney tunes along with their movie medleys and Japanese folk songs, but it wasn't their most memorable feature",Half True,"November 17, 2011"
"The United States' regulations ""are among the most difficult in the world.""","
Republican Gov. Rick Scott repeated a familiar politician's mantra when he bashed ""overregulation.""

In a Nov. 14, 2011, press release, Scott criticized President Barack Obama for accusing America of being ""lazy"" in attracting investment:  
""Obstacles to job creation in America are a result of policy, not of motivation,"" Scott said. ""Our business taxes are among the highest in the world. Our regulations are among the most difficult in the world. If you need evidence, look no further than the companies who have moved their oil rigs from the Gulf coast to foreign countries in the last year because of the regulatory environment. Just last week, yet another major medical device manufacturer announced they were cutting more than 1,000 jobs because of new Obamacare taxes. 

""The president's comments indicate a belief that more taxes, more regulation and more government is the solution, yet those are the very things standing in the way of those of us who are trying – very energetically – to recruit businesses and jobs to our states.""

Scott made a few strongly-worded claims in that statement, but for this Truth-O-Meter we will explore whether ""our regulations are among the most difficult in the world.""

Scott has portrayed himself as a slayer of regulations. He promised to freeze all regulations in Florida during his 2010 campaign.

We went in search of data about the U.S. and overregulation. We found several measures that contradicted Scott's statement:  
• The World Bank publishes an annual ""Doing Business"" ranking that examines the business climate in 183 countries. In its most recent report, released in October 2011, it gave the U.S. an overall ranking of fourth, behind Singapore, Hong Kong and New Zealand. The U.S. scored particularly high compared to other countries in getting credit (4), protecting investors (5) and starting a business (13). 

• The conservative Heritage Foundation, together with the Wall Street Journal, publishes an annual ""Index of Economic Freedom,"" which in 2011 placed the U.S. 9th out of 179 countries with a score of 77.8 out of 100. This index looks at several factors including government spending, property rights and business freedom. On business freedom -- on which the U.S. scored 91 -- Heritage wrote, ""The overall freedom to create and run a private enterprise, regulated primarily at the state level, is strongly protected. However, new regulatory uncertainty hampers business expansion and employment creation."" Heritage's index relies heavily on the World Bank's report.

• The libertarian Cato Institute publishes an ""Economic Freedom of the World"" report that stated that ranked the U.S. 10th among 141 countries in 2009. ""The world's largest economy, the United States, has suffered one of the largest declines in economic freedom over the last 10 years, pushing it into tenth place. Much of this decline is a result of higher government spending and borrowing and lower scores for the legal structure and property rights components,"" the report said.

The report shows that ""the U.S. is still more free by comparison to much of the world,"" said Ian Vásquez, director of the Cato Institute's Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity, in an e-mail to PolitiFact. ""But that measure only captures regulations that can be compared across countries and misses a lot. There is no good global index on this issue. Bottom line, the statement is probably true about some regulations, but not overall in the world.""

What experts told us

We sent Scott's claim -- and the examples he cited about oil rigs moving overseas and job cuts at a medical manufacturer -- to several experts. (Scott's press release didn't identify the medical manufacturer.) None of them fully defended Scott's statement that the United States' regulations are among the most difficult in the world. Several referred us to the World Bank report we mentioned above, while others warned that comparing regulations among countries can be difficult. 

The U.S.'s ranking ""is a far cry from 'most difficult,"" wrote Lawrence J. White of New York University in an e-mail, pointing to the World Bank ratings.

James Gattuso of the Heritage Foundation said that the trends in the World Bank report are mixed for the U.S. and pointed to an Oct. 28 Wall Street Journal report (subscription required to view full article) that said that although the U.S. is ranked fourth, it has dropped in some categories in recent years including on paying taxes and ease of registering property. And the cost of starting a business measured as a percentage of per capita income as well as the cost to import have increased. 

Paul Portney, an economics professor at the University of Arizona, was chief economist for the White House Council on Environmental Quality in 1979-80 under President Jimmy Carter. He sent us an answer as it pertains to environmental regulations, which is relevant here because half of Scott's evidence cited in his press release related to oil rigs moving from the Gulf to foreign countries due to regulation.

""The U.S., like many of the world's developed countries, does have stringent environmental regulations. Ours are in general about as stringent as those in Europe and Japan, though I'd say that Europe's are now tougher than ours. In some respects, though, we go beyond what other countries do (an example is the regulation of auto emissions, though that is more the doing of the State of California than federal standards). Compared to China, India, Russia and Brazil--the rapidly developing countries of the world--our standards are much tougher, and that has no doubt played some role in the relocation of industry to those places. However, you have to remember that there are benefits that accompany the higher costs of regulation in the U.S. My guess is that few Floridians would be willing to tolerate Beijing, Mumbai, Moscow or Rio de Janeiro air quality, to take but one example. ... I'd say that there are other, more important factors that affect business location than regulatory burdens, even while acknowledging that we can and must streamline our regulatory process.""

Gov. Scott responds

Scott spokesman Brian Burgess e-mailed us a response.

""I hope you aren’t missing the forest for the trees…but the phrase you have chosen to zero in on is rather vague, not really quantifiable, and simply refers to the difficult long-term outlook that American job creators are facing.""

Burgess directed us to the Florida chamber's small business survey which stated ""The top issues facing Florida’s small businesses continue to include government regulations, access to capital, healthcare, taxes.""

Burgess also stated in an e-mail that federal regulations have been on the rise in recent years and that thousands more are in the works -- but that wasn't what Scott said.

As for the World Bank study, Burgess wrote that the World Bank study notes that it is limited in scope and quoted from the preface: ""It does not attempt to measure all costs and beneﬁts of a particular law or regulation to society as a whole. Nor does it measure all aspects of the business environment that matter to ﬁrms and investors or affect the competitiveness of an economy.""

Burgess concluded: ""In short, the governor’s comment is based on his own experience in international business, his conversations with other business owners, entrepreneurs and other job creators in Florida and throughout the world, and the hard data that shows that the U.S. regulatory environment has grown progressively worse in recent years and is projected to continue down that path – an outlook that makes the United States regulatory environment among the most difficult in the world. The statement was worded carefully because the subject matter is difficult to quantify. Even World Bank admits as much."" 
Our ruling 
Scott said ""our regulations are among the most difficult in the world."" As his evidence, he cites companies moving their oil rigs from the Gulf Coast overseas and a medical device manufacturer cutting more than 1,000 jobs ""because of new Obamacare taxes."" Even if some companies move overseas or cut jobs and attribute those actions to overregulation, that doesn't mean that regulations in the U.S. are among the most difficult in the world. The reports we found ranked the U.S. between 4th and 10th for business climate. Scott, along with other political or business leaders, certainly can point to concerns about the number, cost or impact of regulations. But Scott hasn't proven that our country's regulations are among the most difficult in the world. In fact, the evidence we found points in the opposite direction",False,"November 16, 2011"
"Solar and wind energy are ""both cheaper than nuclear right now.""","
During a Nov. 8, 2011, appearance on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, former President Bill Clinton touted the prospects for adopting renewable energy.

""Solar energy and wind energy ... would already be competitive with coal if you had to pay the extraneous costs of coal -- the health care costs and other things. And ... wind within two years and solar within five will be competitive in price with coal. They're both cheaper than nuclear right now.""

A reader asked us to check Clinton’s comment. We won’t rate his claim that wind and solar will be competitive with coal within two and five years respectively, since that’s a prediction. Instead, we’ll focus on his claim that solar and wind energy are ""both cheaper than nuclear right now.""

We found a price comparison published in 2011 by the Energy Information Administration, which is part of the U.S. Department of Energy. It uses ""levelized cost"" to compare various energy technologies. This measurement, widely used by energy policy analysts, includes the inflation-adjusted price tag for building and operating a plant over its life cycle.

Here’s the summary table from this study, with the relevant technologies in bold. (One factor that was not included in this calculation was state or federal incentives, such as tax credits.) 
  
94.8 
109.4 
136.2 
66.1 
63.1 
89.3 
124.5

97.0 
243.2 
210.7 
311.8 
101.7 
112.5 
86.4 
  
So, according to this study, the least expensive form of wind energy -- using onshore turbines -- is about 15 percent cheaper than nuclear. But the cheapest form of solar -- using photovoltaic panels -- is about 85 percent more expensive than nuclear. This means that Clinton’s claim was half-right. (Clinton also could have pointed to three additional forms of renewable energy that are cheaper than nuclear -- geothermal, biomass and hydropower.)

The experts we contacted generally agreed with this analysis.

""It’s common and convenient to couple solar and wind in offhand references, but solar-based electricity remains, for now, appreciably costlier than wind,"" said Joel Darmstadter, a senior fellow with Resources for the Future, a Washington-based think tank on energy and environmental issues. He cautioned that not including government incentives does add to the uncertainty of these figures, though it potentially cuts both ways. For instance, nuclear plants benefit from the Price-Anderson Act, which limits their accident liability, while solar and wind receive different types of tax credits, he said.

Stephen Brown, an economist at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas who specializes in energy policy, agreed that Clinton was right on wind but not on solar. He added that if you include additional factors known as externalities -- the kinds of things Clinton was referring to in the first part of his quote, such as the spillover environmental costs of the technology in question -- then the cost comparison could change. For instance, if the externalities were found to be sufficiently low for solar and sufficiently high for nuclear, he said, solar might end up being cheaper than nuclear.

However, since Clinton wasn’t making that comparison, we won’t factor that possibility into our rating.

A final thought from Darmstadter: In the short term, the comparative price options make natural gas, not any of the renewable fuels, the lowest-cost competitor with coal. Several natural gas technologies are cheaper than coal, according to the Energy Department study.

Clinton was correct about wind energy being ""cheaper than nuclear right now,"" at least the onshore kind. But for now, nuclear beats the cheapest form of solar energy on price",Half True,"November 11, 2011"
"The EPA ""wants to hire 230,000 new government regulators that will cost the taxpayer $21 billion.""","The Environmental Protection Agency has been the source of a series of eye-popping but false claims including that the federal agency intends to regulate dust, that it treats spilled milk the same as oil spills and that it plans to implement what has been dubbed a ""cow tax.""

Here's the latest charge against the EPA: the agency wants to go on the mother of all hiring sprees.

U.S. Rep. Allen West, a Republican in South Florida, made the charge in a TV interview on Oct. 21, 2011.

""The objective of this administration, truly the objective of the liberal progressives, is to get more people wedded to government either by subsistence check or employment check,"" West said. ""When you hear an EPA that wants to hire 230,000 new government regulators that will cost the taxpayer $21 billion, when you have (U.S. Sen.) Harry Reid coming out and saying that we need to hire more people in the public sector over the private sector that's not how we are going to restore our economy. But that's how they would create a victim class, an entitlement class, a new welfare state that will be totally dependent upon them that will change national level elections hence and forever more.""

That's quite a want-ad for the EPA, which currently has about 18,000 employees and an annual budget of $8.7 billion. Does it really want to hire 230,000 new employees at a cost of $21 billion?

Supreme Court ruled greenhouse gas is a pollutant

The claim that the EPA wants to hire 230,000 new employees to regulate greenhouse gas emissions has been hotly debated among bloggers and media outlets. The story begins back in 2007, when the Supreme Court ruled that greenhouse gas emissions from cars are a pollutant under the Clean Air Act and ordered the EPA to determine whether they endanger human health. In 2009, the EPA determined that greenhouse gas emissions do endanger human health.

Under the Clean Air Act approved by Congress in 1970, if the EPA regulates a pollutant under one section of the Clean Air Act -- in this case, auto emissions -- it must regulate that pollutant under the permitting sections of the Clean Air Act. This meant that the EPA would have had to regulate greenhouse gasses from all sources that emit them above the level set in statute: 100 or 250 tons per year. (The threshold is different depending on which Clean Air Act permitting program is involved.) That would mean that millions of small sources not previously regulated under the Clean Air Act permitting programs -- such as restaurants, commercial bakeries and apartment buildings -- would also have to apply for permits from the EPA.

Since that would be a massive undertaking, the EPA sought to phase in implementation.

In January 2011, the EPA started with the largest businesses such as large power plants and oil refineries. That hasn't required more staff because the applicants are going through the same permitting process they have in the past -- with questions about an additional pollutant, greenhouse gases, tacked on.

Businesses that face additional EPA regulation have challenged the agency in court. The Coalition for Responsible Regulation is a plaintiff in the case -- the Los Angeles Times reported that the coalition's officers are the same as Quintana Minerals Resources, a large owner of coal reserves.

Media frenzy The Daily Caller, a right-leaning news website, published a Sept. 26 article that pulled quotes from the government's Sept. 16 court brief in the case.

The headline of the article was ""EPA: regulations would require 230,000 new employees, $21 billion"".

The article stated:

""The Environmental Protection Agency has said new greenhouse gas regulations, as proposed, may be 'absurd' in application and 'impossible to administer' by its self-imposed 2016 deadline. But the agency is still asking for taxpayers to shoulder the burden of up to 230,000 new bureaucrats — at a cost of $21 billion — to attempt to implement the rules.""

The article quoted part of the court brief which stated: ""Hiring the 230,000 full-time employees necessary to produce the 1.4 billion work hours required to address the actual increase in permitting functions would result in an increase in Title V administration costs of $21 billion per year.""

By the next day, Media Matters for America, a liberal group, disputed The Daily Caller's report and so did POLITICO, which quoted EPA spokesman Brendan Gilfillan who said that The Daily Caller's report was ""comically wrong.""

Government argues that full implementation would overwhelm system

We read portions of the court brief in which the federal government argues that the thresholds Congress established -- 100 or 250 tons per year -- ""pose significant implementation difficulties when applied to greenhouse gases...."" and ""would result in coverage of millions of additional sources, thereby presenting overwhelming regulatory burdens.""

These ""burdens would inundate"" the EPA and state permitting authorities resulting in billions of dollars in costs and years of delays for obtaining permits, the U.S. Department of Justice and EPA brief states. The government even calls this ""unmanageable burdens,"" which is why the EPA is using what they call a ""tailoring"" rule to phase in regulation.

The government calculated how many employees it would need -- and at what cost -- if it was required to implement monitoring greenhouse gas emissions without tailoring.

""Hiring the 230,000 full-time employees necessary to produce the 1.4 billion work hours required to address the actual increase in permitting functions would result in an increase in Title V administration costs of $21 billion per year."" Although The Daily Caller ended its quote here, the court brief continues with a key point: ""Based on this analysis, EPA found that applying the literal statutory thresholds (100/250 tpy) on January 2, 2011, would ""overwhelm the resources of permitting authorities and severely impair the functioning of the programs....""

So the 230,000 employees figure, and the $21 billion cost, is something that the federal government calculated for the purposes of illustrating that it doesn't want to hire that many people or pay that much and instead wants to phase in implementation.

That covers the current state of hiring, but what about in the future as the EPA expands its implementation?

The EPA states, starting on page 30 of the court brief, that by July 2012 the EPA will address various options to streamline the process.

""Thus, the Tailoring Rule is calculated to move toward eventual full compliance with the statutory threshold, unless, notwithstanding EPA’s significant efforts at further reducing the administrative burdens through streamlining and other actions, impossibility of full administrative implementation persists at that time,"" states the court brief on page 31.

We turned to Lisa Heinzerling, now a Georgetown Law professor who was involved in this issue when she worked in high-level positions at the EPA in 2009 and 2010, for an explanation of what the EPA is saying about its intentions by 2016.

""The agency recognizes that under the law as currently framed it has a legal obligation at some point to reach those thresholds so it needs be showing progress toward that goal,"" she said. ""'Moving toward' them is different than one day saying 'alright everyone is in and we need 200 and some thousand employees.' The agency is not saying that at all. The agency is saying it recognizes the need to move toward thresholds and also recognizes even with streamlining measures it will come up with in the next five years burdens may still be greater than the agency may be able to tolerably bear, then we will have to see.""

Kevin Bundy, an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, currently one of the interveners on the government's side said:

""What EPA is saying -- in the context of the rule the agency is actually defending -- is that they'll continue to explore ways of 'moving toward' the statutory thresholds, while acknowledging that implementing the program at those thresholds may still be impossible. The rule envisions 'moving toward' the statutory thresholds by streamlining the permit process and by considering permanent exemptions for various categories of sources. 'Moving toward' does not mean 'achieving.' What Rep. West is supposedly afraid of -- EPA hiring 200,000+ additional regulators and so forth -- is exactly what the Tailoring Rule was designed to avoid.""

Bundy points to the EPA's 2010 greenhouse gas tailoring document which states that the EPA plans to propose ways to streamline implementation in future phases including permanently excluding certain small sources.

University of Miami law professor Charlton Copeland, who teaches administrative law, read the tailoring section of the court brief at PolitiFact's request. He said the government cites the hiring numbers to articulate why it wants to depart from a literal reading of the provision.

""I don't read that and get the sense what the EPA is gearing up for is a public works program on its own...,"" Copeland said. ""They keep saying it's 'absurd' or 'impossible.' When I see 'absurd' or 'impossible' they are referencing both to the amount of personnel it would take and the kind of slow down it would impose on the permitting process.""

Gilfillan, the EPA spokesman, said that the EPA won't be hiring 230,000 extra workers now or in 2016 even if the court rules that the EPA can't tailor. The 230,000 workers referenced in the court brief would be a combination of state and federal employees since the EPA handles permitting for some states while it delegates it in others.

Any such massive expansion of the EPA would require Congress to provide the extra money to the EPA -- a highly unlikely scenario. And the ""EPA has no authority to control hiring decisions in state agencies,"" said Robert Glicksman, an environmental law professor at George Washington University Law School, in an e-mail.

West responds and our ruling We asked West's office for an explanation. West's spokeswoman Angela Sachitano sent us a link to a conservative blog that posted a Sept. 23 article from the Institute for Energy Research entitled ""EPA's absurd defense of its greenhouse gas actions,"" which includes some of the same points raised later by The Daily Caller.

Sachitano also sent us a quote from West:

""I am pleased the Environmental Protection Agency has recognized the absurdity of using the Clean Air Act, which was never the intention of Congress, to regulate the emission of carbon dioxide. I'm also pleased that the EPA filed on September 16th a brief with the court that will temporary not require them to hire 230,000 full time employees at a cost to the American Taxpayer of $21 billion.""

But on TV West said: ""When you hear an EPA wants to hire 230,000 new government regulators that will cost the taxpayer $21 billion..."" and cited that as an example of getting more people wedded to the government by employment check. West is suggesting that the federal government is bloated and will bloat even more since the EPA ""wants"" to hire 230,000 new employees at a cost of $21 billion. But the EPA made it clear in its brief that it doesn't want to hire all those folks. It's unclear how the EPA and the states would handle implementation if the courts rule that the EPA can't tailor. But it is clear that the EPA, and the states, wouldn't have the budgets to hire 230,000 more people",False,"November 7, 2011"
"Says it wasn't until he and a Senate colleague were able to ""wrangle the actual streaming video"" from BP that scientists were able to calculate the oil spill flow.","
It's been a year and a half since oil suddenly gushed from the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig into the Gulf of Mexico. 

In the early days, rig operator BP estimated about 1,000 barrels a day might be escaping into the gulf. The true number? More like 50,000 to 60,000 barrels — or more than 2 million gallons — every day, for nearly three months.

How did we learn it was so high?

U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., says it wasn't until he and a Senate colleague were able to ""wrangle the actual streaming video"" from BP that scientists were able to calculate the flow.

Nelson spoke about the spill Oct. 11, 2011, on the Senate floor, where he urged his colleagues to find a way to fund gulf research. He began:

""As one of the senators from a state that borders the Gulf of Mexico, naturally we have been quite concerned in the followup to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. You will remember that was an oil spill that at first BP said: Oh, it was only 1,000 barrels a day. It was not until Sen. (Barbara) Boxer, the chairman of the environment committee, and I were able to wrangle the actual streaming video from 5,000 feet below the surface and put it up on my Web site that the scientists could then calculate how much oil was coming out. It was not anywhere close to 1,000 barrels a day. In fact, it ended up being 50,000 barrels of oil a day that was gushing into the Gulf of Mexico. As a result of that total number of days, almost 5 million barrels of oil has gushed into the gulf, we can expect some serious economic and environmental consequences and particularly the consequences on the critters."" 

The senior senator from Florida, responsible for lifting the veil on a disaster unfolding 5,000 feet underwater?

For this fact-check, we're weighing the statement, ""It was not until Sen. Boxer ... and I were able to wrangle the actual streaming video (of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill) from 5,000 feet below the surface and put it up on my Web site that the scientists could then calculate how much oil was coming out."" 

We reached out to scientists, reviewed news and video from the time, checked official reports on the spill and spoke with the senator's office. 

• • •

On April 20, 2010, an explosion ripped through the drilling rig, killing 11 crew members. As flames raged above water 49 miles off the coast of Louisiana, something equally violent was happening beneath the surface.

It wasn't yet clear what.

But within a day, a nonprofit group called SkyTruth, led by a geologist who had worked for the energy industry, began collecting and analyzing satellite images of the spill — brown swirls a reporter would later say resembled peanut butter. The group got help from Florida State oceanographer Ian MacDonald.

On April 24, BP said that a broken riser pipe was leaking 1,000 barrels a day. A few days later, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration boosted the estimate to 5,000 barrels. That was the first official ""flow rate estimate."" It would be used for weeks. It wasn't based on much.

In late April and early May, SkyTruth said satellite images and Coast Guard maps of the slick showed the flow might be more than four times that.

But none of those estimates could fully account for what was happening below the surface, where chemical dispersants created tiny droplets that spread in underwater plumes.

• • • 
On May 12, BP released a 30-second video of oil and gas spilling from the end of a broken pipe — and scientists scrambled to update their estimates, which now ranged from 20,000 to 100,000 barrels a day. By mid May, media reports spread additional doubt about the 5,000-barrel estimate. Rep. Edward Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who chaired the Energy and Environment Subcommittee, sent BP a letter questioning the size of the spill. 
A few days later, Sens. Nelson and Boxer sent their demand for underwater video. They soon got seven hard drives of high-resolution digital imagery, thousands of hours, said Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin. Low-resolution streaming video — what you may have seen online — wouldn't give scientists the detail they needed, so the senators' offices also uploaded high-resolution files to large-file transfer sites on the Web and in some cases even copied the hard drives and sent them to researchers, such as Timothy Crone at Columbia University.

In June, the senators repeated their call for video evidence, this time for all video records.

In the Oct. 29, 2010, issue of Science magazine, a report co-authored by Crone said the oil's flow was at least 10 times higher than first reported. It credited high-resolution video data ""provided by the office of Senator Bill Nelson and by the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works.""

""Sen. Nelson was one of the strongest proponents of open data access, and his work along with the work of others on that committee were critical for the work of independent scientists to go forward,"" Crone told PolitiFact Florida.

Paul Ruscher, a Florida State professor who along with MacDonald urged that BP release more information, said much of what scientists suggested was initially ignored.
 
""It was a staffer from Sen. Nelson's office who was contacted at some point, and whom I then contacted, to try to encourage both Senate and House energy committee members to get involved,"" he said. 

Ruscher said Nelson and other politicians, including Sen. John Kerry and Markey, should get full credit for pushing NOAA, the Coast Guard and BP to release video.

Final official estimates came from the Flow Rate Technical Group, which used several methods to estimate the amount of oil that streamed from Deepwater Horizon. Among its evidence: high-resolution video.

Our ruling
 
Nelson told his Senate colleagues, ""It was not until Sen. Boxer ... and I were able to wrangle the actual streaming video (of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill) from 5,000 feet below the surface and put it up on my Web site that the scientists could then calculate how much oil was coming out."" 

Scientists quickly challenged BP's early estimate based on satellite images and Coast Guard maps. Independent estimates improved when BP released short video clips. But scientists who specialize in flow rate calculations based on high-resolution, time-stamped video didn't have access to data they needed until Nelson's and Boxer's offices pushed for it. Some of those files were indeed downloaded from Nelson's website, while some were on physical hard drives that had to be mailed.

A casual listener might think scientists were unable to make early calculations that challenged BP's word without video from Nelson's website — and that's not quite the case. Meanwhile, other lawmakers also pushed for greater openness",Mostly True,"October 26, 2011"
"""A Cornell University research study concludes that ethanol generates a 29 percent energy loss, meaning it takes more than a gallon of gasoline to produce a gallon of ethanol.""","
Florida's ethanol mandate has been in place less than a year, and a Panhandle Republican plans to push for its repeal.

Rep. Matt Gaetz, who lives in the coastal community of Fort Walton Beach, argues corn-based fuel takes more energy to make than it generates.

""A Cornell University research study concludes that ethanol generates a 29 percent energy loss, meaning it takes more than a gallon of gasoline to produce a gallon of ethanol,"" he wrote in a recent Pensacola News Journal op-ed.

A PolitiFact Florida reader sent a link our way. We were curious: Has an Ivy League researcher found ethanol to be an energy loser?

We were especially curious because the U.S. Department of Energy says the majority of such studies about ethanol's ""net energy balance,"" especially more recent ones, show the opposite. So, of course, does the renewable fuels industry. 

First, a little background. The Florida law, passed in 2008, has required since Dec. 31, 2010, that most gasoline include 9 percent to 10 percent ""agriculturally derived"" fuel. Lawmakers said they wanted to boost renewable energy that would cut greenhouse gas emissions and reduce reliance on foreign oil. 

But boaters in Gaetz's district were ready to ""get out the pitchforks,"" he said. The law doesn't apply to gas sold for small engines or boats. Still, some boaters who used the mix, known as E10, found it would rot out fuel lines and gunk up carburetors. Gaetz, propelled by angry constituents, did some research — and now has a file in his Tallahassee office to support legislation to turn back the mandate. He sent us a news release from Cornell News Service, ""Cornell ecologist's study finds that producing ethanol and biodiesel from corn and other crops is not worth the energy.""

That appears to give Gaetz's claim strong roots.

So does the study itself, which said ""to produce a liter of (corn) ethanol requires 29 percent more fossil energy than is produced as ethanol."" Researchers included all kinds of ""energy inputs"" required to produce fuel from corn — more than a dozen just to grow the corn in the first place, from production of pesticides and nitrogen fertilizer to construction of farm equipment to food for farmworkers. (The authors argue that government and industry studies don't take enough ""energy inputs"" into account, which is why they get a different result.) All the fossil energy, from natural gas to liquid fuel to coal, got totaled up and explained as ""gasoline equivalents.""

That's a little more nuanced than Gaetz's claim that a study said it takes ""gasoline"" to produce ethanol. But it's close.

Still, the study was from 2005. Did Gaetz quote an outdated statistic to make his point?

We chatted with one of the researchers, David Pimentel, an emeritus professor in agriculture and life sciences at Cornell. We read him Gaetz's claim. 
""Yeah, that's correct,"" Pimentel said. ""We have more up-to-date data, though. ...

""It would be 1.5 gallons of gasoline equivalents to produce 1 gallon of ethanol. So this is even worse.""

In other words, Gaetz cited an old number. But more recent work from the same researchers would have even better demonstrated his point. That's scarcely statistical malfeasance.

What about the fact that Pimentel's research flies in the face of government and industry studies? We would have preferred Gaetz note that in his op-ed, but Pimentel's a widely cited biofuel skeptic whose work is addressed by USDA researchers and weighed by other Ivy League energy experts. That makes Pimentel's work the subject of legitimate discussion. 
This fact-check doesn't attempt to evaluate the science itself, but whether Gaetz accurately characterized a scientific study when he wrote, ""a Cornell University research study concludes that ethanol generates a 29 percent energy loss, meaning it takes more than a gallon of gasoline to produce a gallon of ethanol.""

We found the study and talked with the Cornell researcher, who said Gaetz accurately cited him. Still, we're concerned readers might think it literally takes gasoline — rather than gasoline ""equivalents"" — to produce ethanol. Meanwhile, with the Ivy League appeal of Gaetz's statistic, it might appear to represent settled scientific consensus. In fact, researchers battle from paper to paper — and Pimentel's in the minority. So, the op-ed claim was accurate, but needs some clarification",Mostly True,"October 19, 2011"
"""Since 1970, the Clean Air Act has reduced toxic and health-threatening air pollution by 60 percent while our economy has grown more than 200 percent.""","
A recent environmental flare-up in Congress drew the ire of one Georgia representative and an opportunity to dust off the Truth-O-Meter.

U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson recently used his website to voice his outrage about a bill called the TRAIN Act.

The bill passed the House of Representatives in late September with strong support by Republicans who said the act is needed to examine Obama administration environmental policies they say have resulted in higher oil, gas and coal prices. The bill, as of late last week, was in the U.S. Senate’s Committee on Environment and Public Works.

Johnson, a DeKalb County Democrat, said the bill would block ""two of the most important, life-saving Clean Air rules in decades -- the mercury and air toxics rule and cross-state air pollution rule.""

The congressman then argued it’s false to claim strong environmental regulations hurt big business and used some numbers to back up his case.

""Since 1970, the Clean Air Act has reduced toxic and health-threatening air pollution by 60 percent while our economy has grown more than 200 percent,"" Johnson said.

So are Johnson’s numbers correct?

The congressman’s office said the information we wanted to check came from the American Lung Association. A spokesman for the association referred us to an Environmental Protection Agency report last year that found emissions for six common pollutants had declined by 63 percent since 1970. The EPA report also found the nation’s gross domestic product has increased by 204 percent in that same time frame.

Several experts we spoke with said the EPA’s numbers were on target and had no quarrels with the federal agency’s research.

""I think [Johnson] is on point,"" said Lynn Goldman, dean of the George Washington University School of Health Services.

On the economic growth part of the claim, two local economics experts we interviewed thought that number was on target, too. They both looked at GDP data that was adjusted for inflation. Christine Ries, who teaches economics at Georgia Tech, said gross domestic product is the measure most commonly used to measure economic growth.

Georgia State University economics department chairwoman Sally Wallace also found no problem with the math in Johnson’s statement. She did suggest we look at per capita income to examine the second part of the congressman’s claim. The growth in that category was also above 200 percent, from $19,167 in 1970 to the 2010 per capita income of $40,584.

Johnson’s statement seems to imply that the Clean Air Act did not hurt the economy or even helped it. Wallace wasn’t sure a direct correlation can be made.

She researched GDP 10 years before the Clean Air Act passed and the 40 years since and concluded that the average annual growth was greater before 1970. ""It’s kind of difficult to say it’s directly related,"" Wallace told us.

Two groups joined forces last year to research the economic impact of the Clean Air Act. The Small Business Majority, an advocacy group for the nation’s 28 million small businesses, and the Main Street Alliance, a national coalition of small business networks in 15 states, concluded in its 10-page report that about 1.3 million jobs were created between 1977 and 1991 as a result of environmental regulations from the Clean Air Act. Using some EPA data, they believe the Clean Air Act’s benefits far outweighed the costs. The report criticized congressional efforts to scale back the EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act.

For years, as a 2001 paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research noted, manufacturers have argued whether the act puts them at a competitive disadvantage globally. The report by the widely cited think tank looked at 15 years of data and concluded that the regulations ""retard industrial activity.""

Johnson is correct in his statement about the Clean Air Act’s impact on pollution. The rest of his argument was aimed at countering claims that strong environmental policies hurt business. The numbers the congressman used seem to be on target, but there’s some room for debate about the Clean Air Act’s impact on the economy",Mostly True,"October 19, 2011"
"Says that ""In 2009, I saved ratepayers around $500 million by persuading the Council to pursue a less expensive compliance mechanism if the City is required to treat Bull Run drinking water.""","
Correction appended: An earlier version of the story incorrectly stated that the switch to UV had not saved ratepayers any money. The error does not change the ruling. 
Portland commissioner Amanda Fritz, running for another term, is proud that in her first year in office, she came out against a recommendation by the Water Bureau to build an expensive direct filtration system. Instead, she supported was to build a cheaper ultraviolet system that would zap cryptosporidium from the city’s drinking water.

""In 2009, I saved ratepayers around $500 million by persuading the Council to pursue a less expensive compliance mechanism if the City is required to treat Bull Run drinking water,"" Fritz writes on her campaign literature. ""I partnered with neighborhood and business advocates to get this done by arranging for a Council work session and public hearing, where citizens made clear that the less expensive option is more responsible. The result was a unanimous vote reversing the Water Bureau’s previous plan.""

We here at PolitiFact Oregon take these campaign claims seriously. Was it true that Fritz had single-handedly, with citizen support and a public hearing, persuaded the City Council to go against a recommendation by the Water Bureau? And did she in fact save ratepayers $500 million?

Portland gets its drinking water pretty much untouched from the Bull Run watershed east of the city. It’s delicious and clean and we’re all very proud of it. However, we’re also under orders from the Environmental Protection Agency to protect the water we drink, following a cryptosporidius outbreak that killed at least 69 people in 1993 in Wisconsin.

That means we need to do something about the open reservoirs where we store some of our drinking water and we have to treat against cryptosporidium, even though the last time we found any was in 2002.

All the city commissioners think the federal mandate is unnecessary. But they’ve made plans to comply even as they seek a way out of some of the conditions. In 2009, the Water Bureau recommended meeting the cryptosporidium criteria with a $385 million filtration system that they argued would cost more, but be more versatile and forward-thinking in the end.

Groups such as Friends of the Reservoirs and beer makers Rob and Kurt Widmer lobbied against the filtration system. They argued that if anything had to be done, why not opt for ultraviolet light, which would be cheaper to build at $100 million.

City Council meeting records show that  Fritz, along with commissioners Dan Saltzman and Nick Fish, voiced concerns about the cost. But Commissioner Randy Leonard, who oversees water, backed his staff, and at City Hall, it’s considered bad form to go against the commissioner in charge.

Fritz and Saltzman went on record as opposed to Leonard. As the council vote neared, Leonard realized he didn’t have Fish either. Leonard agreed to go with UV, saying that he doesn’t think anybody ""has ever accused me of being a bad vote counter.""

So is it fair for Fritz to hog the leadership limelight? We asked the two commissioners who also expressed doubts about filtration. They said it was absolutely fair. ""She kind of pushed it; she called the question. It’s an accurate claim, for what it’s worth,"" Saltzman said.

Fish said Fritz and Saltzman were on the same page, but, ""I think she was the one who was the most outspoken on this one. Ultimately, she persuaded me that UV was the right way to go and … I became the third vote on UV.""

Fritz doesn’t have a lot of high-profile scores on her record as she defends her seat against Mary Nolan. So we can see why she talks about this ""money save"" a lot. On her city office blog, Fritz wrote Aug. 22 that ""citizens pushed successfully to save $500 million in 2009, with my leadership inside City Hall …"" In an April 15 re-election email to reporters, she said she felt ""privileged to have been in the position in the first half of my term to save Portland ratepayers $500 million on water rates …""

And in a 2010 profile, she relays this anecdote to then-Willamette Week reporter Beth Slovic:
  
""I went home that evening having gotten this 5-0 vote,"" Fritz recalls, ""and I said to my kids, ‘I saved the ratepayers $500 million today,’ and the answer was, ‘Well, that’s great, Mom. What’s for dinner?’""   

After our probing, we’re comfortable giving Fritz full credit on her persuasiveness. It’s not easy going up against the commissioner in charge of a bureau, especially if it’s Randy Leonard.

Now, on to the savings. How does she estimate she saved ratepayers $500 million? After all, the difference between $385 million and $100 million is $285 million, not ""around $500 million.""

Fritz said she takes interest costs into consideration, because the city would borrow money to build either system. She cites figures by the city’s budget office showing it would cost $180 million for the UV system and $700 million for  filtration -- or an 80 percent add-on. There’s your ""around $500 million"" in ratepayer savings, she said in an email.

But we think that calculation is inflated. Regular people don’t think in terms of what a big-ticket item like a house or car might really cost, over the long term, with interest. They don’t think that way about capital budget items on the council agenda, and government officials don’t present them that way either. But $500 million is bigger than $285 million.

Second, Fritz’s grand persuasion hasn’t saved ratepayers anywhere near $285 million or $500 million yet. The ultraviolet system still is being designed, said David Shaff, the Water Bureau’s director. Shaff expects design work to be completed by the end of this year -- which is when the state is expected to weigh in on whether we need a system at all. (We will say, however, that her push resulted in water rates being lowered from nearly 19 percent to 12 percent in 2010-11, a savings of roughly $6 million that year. )

So the bottom line is that if the state gives the city a pass -- which might happen given that a year-long study has shown no evidence of cryptosporidium -- we may not spend anything.

"An Environmental Protection Agency regulation that goes into effect Jan. 1, 2012, regulates dust.","
It was the kind of question that any politician who opposes big government would love to field during a GOP presidential debate.

""My question is, if you were forced to eliminate one department from the federal government, which one would you eliminate and why?"" asked a man from Arlington, Va., via YouTube during the Sept. 22 debate in Orlando.

A moderator chose metro Atlantan Herman Cain to answer it, and to the delight of the audience, he turned his hypothetical ax on a favorite target of big government foes: the Environmental Protection Agency.

""Now, I know that makes some people nervous, but the EPA has gone wild. The fact that they have a regulation that goes into effect Jan. 1, 2012, to regulate dust says that they've gone too far,"" Cain replied.

Dust? The EPA will start regulating dust in January?

We contacted the Cain camp for evidence, but they didn’t reply. Fortunately, the EPA posted its reports on the issue online. Factcheck.org, a fact-checking operation similar to PolitiFact, looked into Cain’s comment as well.

We found that the EPA has long regulated a category of air pollution called ""particulate matter,"" which includes dust. There’s no new regulation scheduled for Jan. 1, 2012.

Particle pollution is a floating mix of solid particles and liquid droplets. Sometimes, the particles are visible, like smoke from a power plant, haze, or the dust that Cain mentioned. Other times, they’re so small they’re invisible to the naked eye.  

These particulates can be made up of any number of chemicals, and can come from a variety of sources such as smokestacks, fires or construction sites.

A growing body of scientific evidence links particle pollution to a variety of health problems, including respiratory issues, lung disease, heart problems and even higher death rates, according to multiple independent reviews of the scientific literature as well as the EPA.

A small number of studies have even linked naturally occurring dust storms to a rise in trips to the emergency room for cardiovascular problems, according to an EPA review of scientific studies.  

The EPA has regulated this form of air pollution since 1971 under the Clean Air Act, and requires air monitors in areas with populations greater than 100,000, according to state and federal documents. But it does not specifically single out farm dust for regulation.

Since states have to comply with the regulations or risk losing federal money, they may institute rules for farm dust to get into compliance with the law, a lobbyist for the farm industry and news accounts confirm.  

The Clean Air Act requires the EPA reviews its particle pollution standards every five years. And that’s where the current dust-up over dust began.

The EPA released its most recent policy assessment in April. It concludes that based on the newest research, it’s worthwhile to consider tightening some standards on larger or ""coarse"" particulates. This category includes dust from landfills, construction sites, agriculture and industrial sources such as steel mills.

The agriculture industry and other groups objected, saying this suggestion doesn’t make sense for rural areas, where tractors and pickups kick up naturally occurring dirt in the fields or on unpaved roads.

But both the EPA and regulation opponents agree that no regulation is in the pipeline, and it’s certainly not coming Jan. 1.

Factcheck.org’s Sept. 23 story on the debate noted that EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson testified before the U.S. House Committee on Agriculture in March that it was a ""mischaracterization"" that the EPA is trying to ""expand regulation of dust from farms.""

Indeed, the EPA has not formally submitted new regulations for review, an agency spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia. Jackson said she would make a decision on whether to tighten the rules in July, according to a Reuters news story, but she has yet to do so.

Even if the EPA were to submit such regulations today, it could take a year or so for them to go into effect, said Richard Krause, a lobbyist for the American Farm Bureau Federation. The EPA would have to make any proposal available for public review and comment, a process that could take some months.

So to sum up:

The EPA has been regulating large particulate matter, including dust, for four decades, but does not single out farm dust or require monitoring in more rural areas.

EPA staffers and scientists concluded after an assessment of the most recent science that it’s worthwhile to consider tightening current regulations, but the EPA has not formally proposed any regulation, and even if they did so today, it could take a while for it to go into effect.

So, Cain does have a point. The EPA does regulate dust under the Clean Air Act. But Cain’s language was very specific, and now that the dust has settled in the wake of the Republican debate, it’s clear his specifics were incorrect.

Dust is regulated, but not at all in the way that Cain described",False,"October 5, 2011"
"Says ""Every year air pollution protections are delayed, another 34,000 people will die prematurely.""","
Even in these cynical, partisan days, there are some universal truths. For example: Sulfur dioxide is a pollutant that can severely affect a person’s health and, in extreme cases, be fatal. Nitrogen oxide is another common and nasty pollutant that makes people sick.

Scientists and non-scientists as well as Republicans and Democrats generally agree the stuff is bad for you.

But how you deal with it is where agreement ends -- at least in Congress.

On the House floor Sept. 23, Republicans muscled through legislation that would delay or scrap rules to reduce mercury and other harmful air emissions, including sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Though the bill passed, it’s highly unlikely to pass the Senate and would be vetoed by President Barack Obama if it did.

Nevertheless, the House debate was lively.

Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., was one of the loudest critics, insisting that delaying the tougher air pollution rules would have dire results.

""Every year these protections are delayed, another 34,000 people will die prematurely,"" he said.

Really? That’s a lot of dead bodies and it’s very specific. Perfect for PolitiFact.

First, some background.

As passed on a nearly party-line vote of 249-169, the bill would, among other things, require the president to set up a committee of Cabinet-level officials to evaluate the toll that a dozen-plus Environmental Protection Agency regulations would have on jobs, electricity, gasoline prices and competitiveness.

Republicans said action was needed to slow down a runaway bureaucracy.

""While there are reasonable regulations that protect our children and help keep our environment clean, we need to stop unelected bureaucrats from imposing excessive regulations that unnecessarily increase costs for consumers and make it harder for our economy to create jobs,"" House Speaker John Boehner said.

Blumenauer and other Democrats said the bill was a craven gift to business that would result in dirtier air and more death.

Blumenauer’s dire prediction was directed at the bill’s delay of something called the Cross‐State Air Pollution Rule which would limit the amount of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide belching from power plants in 27 states.

The pollutants react in the atmosphere to create ground-level ozone and set free tiny particulates that can damage lung capacity and cause respiratory problems.

In real numbers, the EPA says the rules would reduce the amount of sulfur dioxide from the plants by 6.4 million tons a year (from 8.8 million tons in 2005) and to 1.4 million tons a year of nitrogen oxide (from 2.6 million tons annually in 2005).

Those are big numbers and Blumenauer argued Sept. 22 during floor debate that lawmakers voting for the bill would be directly responsible for making people sick.

""The losers are hundreds of thousands of people (who) will die, get illness from cancer, asthma, lost school days, millions of lost work days, the lost quality of life that is documented beyond belief,"" he said. ""This is real, and these people lose.""

Blumenauer’s aides said he was relying on studies conducted by the EPA to support his claim.

The most authoritative of those studies is a 414-page analysis released in June. The dense title suggests it’s a product of science rather than sound-byte politicians: ""Regulatory Impact Analysis for the Federal Implementation Plans to Reduce Interstate Transport of Fine Particulate Matter and Ozone in 27 States; Correction of SIP Approvals for 22 States.""

The report relied on the work of EPA scientists and a survey of independent, peer-reviewed studies by outside scientists.

And there, listed among the ""key findings"" is this: ""The benefits result primarily from 13,000 to 34,000 fewer (particulate matter) and ozone-related premature mortalities.""

The report repeats the number eight more times.

We find that Blumenauer was on solid ground. But he also  cherry-picked the highest death number rather than using the range of 13,000 to 34,000 additional deaths.

While that omission does not change the conclusion that air pollution is bad for public health, it could exaggerate the problem",Mostly True,"October 3, 2011"
Says she helped lead the launch of curbside recycling.,"
Before Mary Nolan was a state legislator running for Portland City Council, she worked many years for the city of Portland. While there, she was in charge of two departments: sewers and public works maintenance.

Nolan is not shy about bringing up the municipal part of her resume. The following is listed on her campaign website and on her Facebook campaign page:
  
""As the head of the Bureau of Environmental Services and earlier as Director of Public Works Maintenance, she helped lead landmark improvements in protecting the Willamette River and environment, launching curbside recycling, repairing Portland roads and bridges, and managing public resources to save millions of dollars while bringing projects in on-time and on-budget."" 

That’s a lot of landmark public deeds to absorb. So we’ll focus on just one of her cited accomplishments: Did Nolan help lead the launch of curbside recycling?

Portland residents started recycling from their homes in the late 1980s, back before Nolan entered the recycling scene. In 1983, the state mandated that cities offer the service to residential customers. Portland adopted a system effective June 1, 1987. But it was a free-market system with multiple haulers servicing the same blocks and recycling results were scattered. The companies picked up newspapers weekly and metal, glass and cardboard monthly.

In short, the initial system wasn’t very effective. In February 1992, the city rolled out a new residential recycling program. Households received two bins for recyclables. Milk jugs and magazines were added to mix. But here’s the critical difference: Haulers were allocated their own section of the city, and they were required to collect recycling every week, the same day as trash collection.

""The overhaul that was instituted in 1992, it was game changing. It was a fundamental shift,"" says Bruce Walker, the city’s solid waste and recycling manager who was back then part of a small team charged with making the change happen.

His boss at the Bureau of Environmental Services, which managed recycling at the time, was Sue Keil. Keil said she had been tapped by then-Commissioner Earl Blumenauer to oversee the new recycling system. Nolan, tapped to lead the bureau in mid-1990, was Keil’s boss.

""Certainly Mary was not, as you say, involved in the day-to-day decision making, but I was talking to her about it, and it was on her watch,"" Keil said. ""It’s entirely fair to say this happened on her watch and with her support."" 

In a similar PolitiFact, we gave Portland mayoral candidate Charlie Hales a True for saying that he led on the issue of racially diversifying the Fire Bureau in the early 1990s. As the elected commissioner in charge of the bureau, Hales hired a new fire chief to come to Portland and shake up the bureau. We found that Hales was correct to claim credit.

Nolan, on the other hand, was not a commissioner in charge. She was a bureau director carrying out the order of a commissioner and city council. And on the flip side, Nolan wasn’t even the person directly responsible for revamping the recycling system. That person was Sue Keil.

It’s hard for us to let Nolan take credit when she was neither an elected official or civic body giving the order, nor the person handling day-to-day duties.

Let’s also remember that Portland had a curbside recycling system before Nolan. We know it was clumsy and disorganized and hardly resembled what we have today, but the word ""launch"" makes it sound as if she initiated curbside recycling.

Nolan says she ""helped lead landmark improvements in … launching curbside recycling."" We find this statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details",Half True,"October 1, 2011"
"""We have had over 40 days this summer where it was unsafe to breathe the air.""","
For many Atlanta-area residents, 2011 will be remembered as the long, hot -- no, veryhot -- summer.

The high temperature climbed past 90 degrees on 66 days this summer, according to the National Weather Service. Officials warned it was dangerously hot on some days.

How dangerous was it to be outside, you ask?

""We have had over 40 days this summer where it was unsafe to breathe the air,"" said Jennette Gayer, staff advocate for Georgia Environment, a group with goals of protecting the state’s air, water and natural resources.

The claim surprised us since we’ve seen no widespread reports of Georgians being hospitalized or claiming harm from breathing. We thought we’d check this out.

Gayer made the statement during a recent meeting at Atlanta City Hall. She was there to speak out about the proposed 1 percent sales tax to pay for about 150 transportation projects in the Atlanta region. A referendum is scheduled for July 2012.

Gayer’s remarks to the packed audience of about 200 people in the City Council chamber were focused on her desire to see more projects she thinks may improve air quality, such as a commuter rail line between Atlanta and Griffin.

""[W]e need ... more alternatives to cars,"" Gayer told us in an email.

Gayer based her comments on the state Department of Natural Resources, which monitors air quality in the Atlanta region from 10 different locations. The state uses federal guidelines to measure the level of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone (at ground level) and sulfur dioxide. The state sets a ratings scale, green for ""good"" to purple for ""very unhealthy."" Some observers contend the ratings are based on flawed conclusions about the impact of pollutants on the environment.

Susan Zimmer-Dauphinee, who is in charge of running the state’s monitoring system, said there have been 38 days this year where air quality levels were labeled as ""unhealthy"" or ""code orange."" The unhealthy rating is primarily for groups such as young children, the elderly and those with asthma or other respiratory conditions.

So is it stretching the truth to say there have been 40 days this summer when it was ""unsafe"" to breathe the air because the code orange doesn’t include all groups?

""The young, the elderly and people with existing respiratory problems would definitely be most impacted, but more and more research is pointing to even healthy adults experiencing problems,"" Gayer said. 
Gayer believes the current air quality standards should be strengthened, pointing to arguments from some scientists who lobbied the federal Environmental Protection Agency on that point. The Obama administration earlier this month reversed course on some clean air regulations aimed at reducing smog. Some congressional leaders worried the tougher air quality standards would hurt businesses in the struggling economy.

Arthur Winer, former director of UCLA’s Environmental Science and Engineering Program, said Gayer could have been more precise.

""In general, the air quality standards and health alerts are focused on the most vulnerable populations, rather than the general public,"" said Winer, who says he has written more than 200 journal articles and book chapters on air pollution and related topics over the past 30 years. ""However, to be rigorous, it would probably have been better if this person had said ‘there were 40 days this summer in which it was unsafe to breathe the air for small children, the elderly and people with respiratory illnesses like asthma.’ ""

To be more technical, the state’s chart shows 18 of those days were in May and early June, before the official start of summer. Gayer said she based her comments at the meeting on Atlanta’s smog season, which begins May 1 and ends Sept. 30.

Gayer’s comment was generally accurate -- with an emphasis on generally.  But it also leaves out some key details",Half True,"September 30, 2011"
Says Texas wildfires are linked to climate change.,"During a Sept. 26, 2011, speech at a Democratic National Committee fundraising event in San Jose, Calif., President Barack Obama aimed some attack lines at the Republican Party.

""Some of you here may be folks who actually used to be Republican but are puzzled by what’s happened to that party...."" Obama said in comments that, according to the White House’s transcript, were punctuated by laughter. ""I mean, has anybody been watching the debates lately? You’ve got a governor whose state is on fire denying climate change. No, no, it’s true. You’ve got audiences cheering at the prospect of somebody dying because they don’t have health care, and booing a service member in Iraq because they’re gay. That’s not reflective of who we are. We’ve had differences in the past, but at some level we’ve always believed, you know what, that we’re not defined by our differences. We’re bound together.""

After several readers brought it to our attention, we zeroed in on Obama’s comment that ""you’ve got a governor whose state is on fire denying climate change.""

The governor in question is Rick Perry of Texas -- one of the leading candidates in the Republican presidential primary and therefore a potential challenger to Obama in his bid for a second term next year.

As for the fires Obama mentioned, Texas has been experiencing one of its most severe wildfire seasons in history.  According to the Texas Forest Service, 3.8 million acres burned and 2,742 homes were destroyed by wildfires between Nov. 15, 2010 and Sept. 26, 2011.

A spokesman for Perry, Mark Miner, thought Obama’s comment was unfair, telling ABC News, ""It’s outrageous President Obama would use … the worst fires in state history as a political attack.""

Asked about Obama’s comments during a Sept. 26 press availability, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters on Air Force One that the president’s ""point was simply that you have severe weather in that state, and the leader of that state questioned whether something that's been well established as a scientific fact is in fact a fact. … (Obama’s) point is that the link between climate and the severe weather that we’ve been experiencing is something that's studied by scientists all the time, and to simply dismiss it is, he believes, not responsible leadership.""

Despite our readers’ urgings, we gave serious thought to not rating Obama’s comment on the Truth-O-Meter. Obama clearly intended it to be a lighthearted comment, and the audience took it that way, as evidenced by applause noted in the transcript. In addition, the line was a rhetorical aside, not part of a substantive policy address about climate change.

But Obama’s comment fit our main qualification for choosing items to fact-check -- would people wonder whether the comment is true? Is it possible to draw a link between a specific weather event, such as the drought in Texas and the wildfires, and global climate change?

As it turns out, this question has an interesting answer.

First, some background on climate change.

Perry is on record expressing skepticism that human actions are causing climate change. During a Republican debate on Sept. 7, 2011, he said that ""the science is not settled (on climate change). The idea that we would put Americans’ economy at jeopardy based on scientific theory that’s not settled yet to me is just nonsense."" We also fact-checked a separate comment by Perry ""questioning the original idea that man-made global warming is what is causing the climate to change. … (It is) more and more being put into question.""

We ruled Perry’s statements False. As we noted, one of the most oft-cited reports on climate change comes from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is widely considered the leading international organization on climate science. It includes the scientific consensus of thousands of researchers from 194 countries. ""Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in (human-created) greenhouse gas concentrations,"" the most recent report states.
   
In the United States, the U.S. Global Change Research Program coordinates and integrates federal research on climate. Its 2009 report mirrored the IPCC's conclusions, and the report directly addressed the question of how climate change could affect weather.

""Water is an issue in every region, but the nature of the potential impacts varies,"" it said in a summary. ""Drought, related to reduced precipitation, increased evaporation and increased water loss from plants, is an important issue in many regions, especially in the West. Floods and water quality problems are likely to be amplified by climate change in most regions. Declines in mountain snowpack are important in the West and Alaska where snowpack provides vital natural water storage.""

However, climate-change experts have also long urged caution in assuming that particular weather events are caused or influenced by climate change.

Consider a June 2011 paper published by the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, an independent research organization. In the paper -- titled ""Extreme Weather and Climate Change Understanding the Link, Managing the Risk"" -- co-authors Daniel G. Huber and Jay Gulledge write that ""when we ask whether climate change ‘caused’ a particular event, we pose a fundamentally unanswerable question."" In fact, they say it is ""nonsense"" to debate a direct climatological link between a single event and the long-term rise in the global average surface temperature.

The reason, Huber and Gulledge write, is the distinction between ""climate"" -- a long-term pattern that averages many weather events over the years -- and a particular weather event.

By definition, Huber and Gulledge write, ""an isolated event lacks useful information about climate trends. Consider a hypothetical example: Prior to any change in the climate, there was one category 5 hurricane per year, but after the climate warmed for some decades, there were two category 5 hurricanes per year. In a given year, which of the two hurricanes was caused by climate change? Since the two events are indistinguishable, this question is nonsense. It is not the occurrence of either of the two events that matters. The two events together – or more accurately, the average of two events per year – define the change in the climate.""

What makes the Texas situation an imperfect fit for this general rule is that what’s happening isn’t one wildfire, or even a spate of wildfires. It’s a months-long season of specific weather-related events -- wildfires -- whose roots stem from broader climatic conditions.

""It is a combination of unprecedented heat this summer, completely obliterating the previous record; exceptional drought conditions; exceptional soil moisture decreases, which exacerbate the temperature extremes; and, on top of that, extensive wild fires,"" said Gavin Schmidt, a climate specialist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. ""These elements cannot be separated. … Extreme heat becomes more common under climate change, and that has consequences, depending on location -- more drought, and more susceptibility to wildfires.""

Even Gulledge, the co-author of the Pew paper that cautioned against blaming weather events on climate change, said the Texas case may constitute an exception to the rule he laid out.

""There is a well-documented link between the earlier start of spring, higher summer temperatures, and drier conditions during summer and fall -- that is, climate change -- and a dramatic increase in wildfire activity in the western U.S. since the late 1980s,"" he said. ""These observations reveal an increase in fire risk due to climate change.""

Gulledge found it noteworthy that in a recent blog post, John Nielsen-Gammon -- the Texas state climatologist and a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University -- suggested a connection between the wildfires and climate change, even if it came with caveats and limitations.

On the one hand, Nielsen-Gammon said the low rainfall levels since October 2010 do not appear to have been made ""more likely"" by global warming. In turn, this rainfall deficit, he estimated, explains most of the excess heat that set the stage for the wildfires. On the other hand, his modeling suggested that global warming did provide an additional contributing factor to the unusually high temperatures. ""The impacts of the drought,"" he concluded, ""were enhanced by global warming.""

What makes this topic so difficult to analyze is that the way the atmosphere works is extremely complicated. Gulledge compared the atmosphere to a car.

""Both the atmosphere and a car are complex systems, but one is fundamentally predictable, while the other is fundamentally unpredictable,"" he said. ""A given force applied to the atmosphere has many different potential outcomes, not a single calculable outcome. That’s different from an automobile, which can be predicted very precisely. If I step on the gas, it will speed up; if I turn the wheel, the car will turn. Consequently, weather forecasters give percentage chances of rain instead of performing a single calculation that predicts a single amount of rain in a given place on a given day.""

A related complication is that this boils down to a question of probabilities rather than certainties.

""The right question to ask is, ‘Has global warming increased the likelihood of an event like the Texas drought occurring’ And the answer to that question is yes,"" said Brian Soden, a professor of meteorology and physical oceanography at the University of Miami. ""While droughts occur in a climate unaffected by human activities, a warming climate increases the likelihood that they will occur.""

He offers an analogy that he credits to a colleague, Tony Broccoli of Rutgers University. ""Consider a baseball player who goes through a rigorous off-season training program, which results in greater strength and faster bat speed,"" Soden said. ""On his first at bat of the season, he hits a home run. Would you say that the home run was a result of his off season training? No one can answer that question. But would you say that the off-season training increased the likelihood of it occurring? Yes.""

Rob Jackson, the director of the Duke Center on Global Change, acknowledges this backdrop of uncertainty. ""Can anyone say with certainty that this is climate-change related? Absolutely not,"" he said. But Jackson -- who went to college and taught in Texas and continues to visit frequently to see family -- suggested that the scale of the Texas wildfires is starting to change the minds of some scientists who have traditionally been hesitant to blame specific weather events on climate change.

""The heat and drought I saw in August is almost enough to make me say that climate change is playing a role, amplifying other factors,"" Jackson said. ""I've never said that before about any weather event.""

Our ruling

Historically, scientists have drawn a clear distinction between specific weather events and longer-range changes in climate, and that sentiment persists. Normally, we would be extremely skeptical of claims linking specific weather events to climate change. However, the situation in Texas that Obama was referring to could be described as something broader than a specific weather event, and there is peer-reviewed evidence linking broader climate change in the American southwest with the incidence of wildfires in the region.

The Texas state climatologist recently wrote that he believes climate change has had an effect in encouraging the current wildfires, but only as a modest contributing factor",Half True,"September 28, 2011"
"""The water quality in the ocean is perfect. It’s been tested up and down every ocean shore in New Jersey.""","
There’s a strip of coastline in the United States where the quality of the water is better than good, according to the governor.

""The water quality in the ocean is perfect,"" Gov. Chris Christie said during a Sept. 2 press conference at Point Pleasant Beach, days after Hurricane Irene blasted through. ""It’s been tested up and down every ocean shore in New Jersey.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found that while test results show the water is the best it’s been in years, some environmental experts disagree with Christie’s assessment.

First, let’s look at how New Jersey reviews water quality.

The state Department of Environmental Protection, in collaboration with local health departments, tests the water from Sandy Hook to Cape May each week from mid-May to mid-September, according to department spokesman Larry Ragonese.

Water samples from swimming areas are tested for fecal coliform and other types of bacteria connected with sewage, stormwater runoff, and other pollutants, he said.

The results, Ragonese said, have come back clean consistently since at least 2006, ranking Jersey shore waters above the 99th percentile of cleanliness on a scale of 100 percent.

""There’s really been a concerted effort to really, really stress the importance of clean beaches,"" Ragonese said.

In fact, New Jersey ranked second in the nation, behind New Hampshire, for ocean water quality in 2010, according to a June report by the National Resources Defense Council.

The weekly tests check the levels of enterococcus, a bacteria normally found in the feces of people and many animals. Any level above 104 enterococci per 100 milliliters of sample is considered too high, according to state standards.

PolitiFact New Jersey reviewed test results for beaches in Atlantic, Cape May, Monmouth and Ocean counties dating to 2005. We found that in most cases, water quality results have been their best since 2008, with the level of enterococci well below the state’s threshold.

If a test sample exceeds acceptable bacteria levels twice, the beach is closed until the bacteria level falls into normal range, Ragonese said. Jill Lipoti, director of the Division of Water Monitoring and Standards for the DEP, said three beaches were closed all along the shore this summer.

Still, three environmental groups challenged Christie’s claim of ""perfect"" water quality.

Trenton-based Environment New Jersey pointed to low oxygen levels in the ocean and questioned the health of the water for marine life. Pollution in Barnegat Bay and beach closures due to pollution also are a concern, said Dena Mottola Jaborska, executive director of Environment New Jersey.

""I think the governor does a disservice to citizens in the state when he makes statements like that,"" Jaborska said. ""There are lots of issues with the ocean.""

Larry Levine, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York City, also said the Jersey shore’s water quality is not perfect.

""Every coastal state has some degree of issues with water pollution at beaches,"" in part due to stormwater runoff from urban and suburban areas where raw sewage and overflow can combine in the same pipe en route to a sewage treatment plant, Levine explained. When heavy rains are more than the treatment plants can handle, an untreated mixture of sewage and runoff can be released into waterways that lead to the coast.

""That’s an issue nationwide, not just in New Jersey,"" Levine said.

Clean Ocean Action of Monmouth County also wouldn’t qualify the water as perfect, but credited New Jersey for taking steps toward improvement.

""The ocean’s much better off than it has been in a decade and while some individual pollutants may still be low, we have taken in this state with the Legislature and the governor’s office many impressive first steps that are long overdue,"" said Sean Dixon, coastal policy attorney for Clean Ocean Action. ""There’s always more to be done.""

Our ruling

Encouraging people to return to the Jersey shore, Christie claimed the water quality is ""perfect,"" and that frequent test results have been favorable up and down the coast.

While test results show that the shore’s waters are better than in past years, some environmental organizations disagree with the governor’s assessment",Mostly True,"September 25, 2011"
"Says ""New Jersey’s $1 billion horse racing industry … employs 13,000 individuals and ensures the preservation of 176,000 acres of horse farmland.""","
The glory days of horse racing in New Jersey have faded.

But if the industry disappears completely, state Sen. Raymond Lesniak claims it will put 13,000 jobs and 176,000 acres of horse farmland at risk.

Lesniak harnessed those statistics in an opinion item promoting two initiatives he says will generate new revenue for horse racing: sports betting and Internet gambling. Gov. Chris Christie vetoed a bill in March that would have allowed Internet gambling and declined to join a lawsuit aimed at overturning the ban on sports betting in the state.

""There is a path to recovery for New Jersey’s $1 billion horse racing industry — which employs 13,000 individuals and ensures the preservation of 176,000 acres of horse farmland — if Gov. Chris Christie would just get off his high horse and see the irreparable damage his tough love is reaping on the industry,"" Lesniak (D-Union) wrote in a Sept. 9 letter to the editor in the Asbury Park Press. ""Unfortunately, horse racing is not at a crossroad; it’s at a tipping point, from which it will not recover when it falls.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found Lesniak incorrectly applied statistics representing the overall equine industry to illustrate the impact of horse racing.

The statistics are from a 2007 study by the Rutgers Equine Science Center that measured the economic impact of the state’s equine industry. All equine animals, including horses, donkeys and mules, were included in the study. But horses account for the bulk of New Jersey’s equine population.

The report found that the equine industry has an annual economic impact of $1.1 billion and generates 13,000 jobs. Equine operations -- farms and stables that house equine animals -- in the state span 176,000 acres of farmland, according to the study.

Of the $1.1 billion in economic impact, $780 million is generated by racetracks and racing-related operations.

""So there’s no doubt that horse racing is the economic driving engine of the entire horse industry in New Jersey,"" said Karyn Malinowski, director of the Rutgers Equine Science Center.

The horse racing industry is responsible for 7,000 of the 13,000 jobs in the overall equine industry and 34,000 of the 176,000 acres of farmland that comprise equine operations in the state, the study said.

When we told Lesniak’s office about the problem with his statistics, he said, in a written statement, ""My comment was for the entire horse industry because without horse racing it will ultimately die, as we’ve seen with the announced closing of the largest horse farm, Perretti.""

Perretti Farms of Cream Ridge specializes in the  breeding and racing of standardbred horses, according to its website. This summer the farm announced plans to close in the next two years.

So, Lesniak’s numbers are off, but let’s look at his larger point. Is the horse racing industry the lifeline of New Jersey’s equine industry?

Malinowski said the entire equine industry is in danger if the horse racing industry crumbles.

""All of these top-shelf support services that you have available to you in the Garden State will be gone,"" she said. ""Because they are primarily supported by racing.""

Jim Heird, executive professor and coordinator at Texas A&M University’s Equine Initiative, said, in general, ""If we lose one part of the industry, it affects the welfare of the entire industry.""

""I think that when any industry leaves the state, it will have some sort of an impact on the economy of the state,"" Lynne Richmond, a spokeswoman with the state Department of Agriculture said. ""We recognize a loss of horse racing in New Jersey would have an impact.""

Our ruling

Horse racing generates $780 million in annual economic impact in New Jersey. It's responsible for 7,000 jobs and equine operations tied to horse racing account for 34,000 acres of farmland in the state, according to a 2007 study.

Lesniak exaggerated the impact of horse racing by incorrectly applying figures for the overall equine industry in New Jersey to one segment of that industry.

But the numbers for horse racing alone -- particularly the annual economic impact figure -- are a significant portion of the statistics for the industry at large and there’s consensus about a broad impact if horse racing disappears from New Jersey",Half True,"September 22, 2011"
"Says that  in the recent year homeowners across Ohio have signed mineral rights agreements ""and I understand that over a billion dollars worth of leases have been signed to date.""","
Ohio Gov. John Kasich has enthusiastically cheered the money-making prospects of hydraulic fracking, a technique used to extract oil and gas from underground shale.

Eastern Ohio, with its energy-laden Utica and Marcellus shale formations, is high on the list of targeted areas where companies are looking buy up rights to drill for the lucrative resources below.

But many have voiced environmental concerns over the process, which pumps millions of gallons of chemical-laced water and sand deep into horizontal wells under high pressure.
  
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is studying hydraulic fracking’s effects on drinking water. And New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican whose pugnacious and conservative style is often compared with Kasich’s, last month ordered a one-year moratorium on the practice so more information can be gathered. Enter Ohio State Sen. Michael Skindell. 
Skindell, a Lakewood Democrat, this month introduced Senate Bill 213, which would institute a ban on hydraulic fracking until the EPA completes its study and lawmakers have time to digest it. A companion bill would require companies to disclose chemicals it uses when drilling. 
Both pieces legislation are aimed at what Skindell sees as a fracking bonanza. 
""In the recent year, we have seen the oil and gas companies go to homeowners throughout Ohio and encourage them to sign leases and turn over mineral rights for this process,"" Skindell said during a Statehouse news conference to promote the two bills. ""And I understand that over a billion dollars worth of leases have been signed to date."" 
That billion-dollar figure caught PolitiFact Ohio’s attention, given the relatively fledgling fracking market. True, reports across Ohio have pegged the Utica shale formations in eastern Ohio as a new frontier of sorts. But $1 billion? We went to Skindell to learn his source. 
Skindell shared with us a web link to a March story published by the Dayton Daily News. The newspaper focused on one company, Chesapeake Energy Corp. of Oklahoma City. Chesapeake, the article noted, ""has reportedly spent $1 billion acquiring leases in Ohio without drilling a producing well, a figure reported by the Wall Street Journal on March 7."" 
By the time it left Skindell’s lips, it was a fact repeated at least third-hand. If it was a fact all. So off to the Wall Street Journal we went. The March 7 story attributed the $1 billion figure to Chesapeake. Journal reporter Ryan Dezember referred PolitiFact Ohio to earnings statements and other financial documents from the publicly held company. Mindful that the news at this point was 6 months old, Dezember theorized that the figure had likely grown. 
Sure enough, a transcript of a July 29 conference call between Chesapeake executives, investors and analysts and Chairman and Chief Executive Aubrey McClendon confirmed this. 
""... We’ve spent between $1.5 billion and $2 billion acquiring leasehold in the Utica,"" said McClendon, referring to the shale in eastern Ohio. And of course, Chesapeake wouldn’t have invested that amount if executives weren’t convinced the resources could yield much more. 
In a financial report issued the day before the conference call, Chesapeake noted that officials believed the Utica shale play could add between $15 billion and $20 billion in value. 
Chesapeake is not the only party interested in Ohio shale. Clif Little, an Ohio State University extension educator in Guernsey and Noble counties, said more than 1,200 property owners have taken his ""leasing farmland for oil and gas"" classes this year. Drilling companies, small oil and gas companies, landowner associations and attorneys all are attempting to secure deep drilling rights, Little added. 
""The $1 billion figure is an old figure,"" Little wrote in an email. ""The amount invested in the Utica and Marcellus would far exceed that number today, but I am no longer keeping track of investment figures."" 
Although he might not have been right on the money, Skindell was very much in the ballpark with respect to Chesapeake’s figures. If anything, he undersold the political point he was trying to make: that Ohio is on the cusp of a fracking boom. 
Skindell’s words were ""over a billion dollars worth of leases,"" and clearly that is the case",True,"September 20, 2011"
"Says New Jersey is ""losing 50 football fields of open space to development every day and the more we develop upstream the more flooding we have downstream.""","
A single football field is not an unusual sight, but try to imagine 50 of them being overrun with development -- every day.

That’s what the New Jersey Sierra Club says is happening daily in the Garden State. In a press release posted on its website Sept. 6, the environmental group tossed out that statistic when discussing the effects of development on flooding.

""We are losing 50 football fields of open space to development every day and the more we develop upstream the more flooding we have downstream,"" according to the press release. ""We need to not only limit development but we need to (make) development with less pavement and impervious cover.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found that football may be alive and well, but developers in New Jersey aren’t seeing as much playing time as they used to. The environmental group is right that development increases the risk of flooding, but construction activity has declined nationwide.

First, let’s explain how ""50 football fields"" translates into acres, and where the Sierra Club received that figure.

New Jersey Sierra Club Director Jeff Tittel argued that the group’s statistic doesn’t count the two end zones. However, the National Football League identifies the ""field"" as including both end zones.

Based on the league’s measurements, a football field represents about 1.32 acres.

Tittel also told us the statistic was based on research done by Rutgers University’s Grant F. Walton Center for Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis. The latest data on open space loss available from that center comes from a July 2010 report detailing land-use changes in New Jersey through 2007.

According to that report, an average of 16,061 new acres were developed in 2007, or about 44 acres per day. That level of development equates to about 33 football fields of development per day.

So, based on that data, the Sierra Club’s estimate is off by 17 football fields, or about one-third.

But here’s the larger mistake made by the Sierra Club: that estimate of 33 football fields refers to development as of four years ago.

""You can’t compare ‘07 to today,"" said Dominick Paragano, president of the New Jersey Builders Association. ""It’s a different economy.""

Updated statewide growth figures will be available later this fall, but data already shows a sizable decrease in development in Ocean County between 2007 and 2010, said Rutgers University professor Richard G. Lathrop, one of the authors of that land-use report. Ocean County was one of the faster-growing counties as of 2007.

Two other data sets also demonstrate the downturn in development activity in New Jersey: the number of housing units authorized by building permits, and the number of construction jobs, according to federal and state statistics.

Many developers aren’t even focused on the sprawl-like development targeted by the Sierra Club. More builders are looking at redevelopment opportunities in urban areas, said Kevin Tartaglione, senior vice president and chief operating officer of the development division at Somerset County-based Advance Realty.

Tittel argued that residential development may be down, but commercial development, highway-widening projects and infrastructure development are still under way.

But with fewer development options available to landowners, the Somerset County-based New Jersey Conservation Foundation has been able to preserve more land in recent years, according to executive director Michele Byers.

Whereas the New Jersey Conservation Foundation completed between 15 and 20 transactions annually in the early part of the decade, it completed about 40 in 2009 and then roughly 50 in 2010, she said.

But Byers said the point behind the Sierra Club’s statement is still legitimate, because the potential for development in New Jersey remains.

""We are really working hard to ramp up as much preservation as we can before we lose the opportunity,"" Byers said.

On the Sierra Club’s second point about flooding, the group is right. Two professors confirmed to us that development heightens the risk of flooding, because there are fewer areas to absorb the water.

""So that water has to go someplace,"" said Tulane University associate professor Stephen Nelson, who teaches a course on natural disasters.

Our ruling

The Sierra Club claimed ""50 football fields"" are developed in New Jersey every day, increasing the danger of flooding. Flooding can be a side effect of development, but the group’s statistic doesn’t reflect the steep decline in construction activity during the past four years.

Tittel argues his organization is using the most recent data available, but that still doesn’t make it right",Half True,"September 19, 2011"
"""Point Pleasant Beach does not own its beaches; they are privately owned and operated by businesses such as Jenkinson’s""","
It might seem a given that a Shore town would rake in waves of revenue from its beaches.

But that’s not always the case. Point Pleasant Beach, for example, doesn’t own most of its beaches but is responsible for some of the costs associated with millions of visitors every summer, according to Mayor Vincent Barrella.

""Point Pleasant Beach does not own its beaches; they are privately owned and operated by businesses such as Jenkinson’s,"" Barrella wrote in an Aug. 22 column that appeared in The star-Ledger.

Could it be true that some of the most popular beachfront along the Jersey Shore is privately owned?

PolitiFact New Jersey found that more than 42 acres of beach are privately owned and operated in Point Pleasant Beach, and the borough owns only the 1.03-acre Maryland Avenue Beach.

Several other Shore towns also do not own their beaches, said Larry Hajna, spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.

Let’s look at beach ownership in the borough.

Point Pleasant Beach has approximately two miles of privately held oceanfront property, according to the borough’s 2006 Open Space and Recreation Plan. The public can access nearly 30 of those 42 acres by purchasing daily or seasonal badges from private operators. The remaining beach is not open to the public, according to the plan.

Most of the borough’s beaches are owned by Jenkinson’s, Martell’s, Risdens Beach Inc., the Elizabeth Carter Association and a number of private homeowners.

One of the largest beaches in the borough is owned by Jenkinson’s, but the company also has the costs that come along with it.

""We own it, operate it, insure it and staff it,"" said Marilou Halvorsen, marketing director for Jenkinson’s Boardwalk.

Although the Maryland Avenue Beach is owned by the borough, Aqua Serve Lifeguard Service leases and operates it. The difference in ownership means Aqua can charge whatever admission fee the market can bear, while municipal operation of the beach would mean the state sets the maximum fee, said Borough Clerk Maryann Ellsworth.

And that’s been a losing proposition for the community.

""We lost so much money running it that we decided at least six years ago to lease out the running of the beach,"" said Ellsworth, who added that the borough lost from $10,000 to $14,000 annually when it operated the beach.

Aqua Serve pays the borough $2,000 annually to operate Maryland Avenue beach, but that money is largely eaten up in costs the borough pays for portable toilets there, Ellsworth said. The daily badge fee at Maryland Avenue Beach is $8.

Beaches and the cost to operate them was even an issue for the town’s forefathers.

Minutes from the Aug. 16, 1887 meeting of the Point Pleasant Beach Council state ""Ownership of the beach turned down by the Council because of extreme cost to the borough for maintenance,"" according to the Point Pleasant Historical Society. At that point, the council decided to permit privately owned beaches in the borough.

Still, Barrella told PolitiFact New Jersey that he hopes the borough can one day buy Risdens Beach if it ever becomes available, so the borough can generate revenue the way he said Belmar and Manasquan do from their beaches.

Belmar’s beach badge revenue total was $3,023,386 from Memorial Day to Labor Day in 2010; and $2,657,278 from Memorial Day this year through Aug. 21, said Patricia Zwirz, purchasing agent.

Manasquan, which has a utility to operate its beach, took in $1,793,000 from beach badges in 2010 for the same period as Belmar; and was at $1,695,000 just before Hurricane Irene hit the Jersey Shore, according to Beach Department manager/beach manager Walter Wall.

Our ruling

Barrella says the borough’s beaches are privately owned and operated by various businesses in town. While Jenkinson’s and others do own most of the beachfront, the borough owns slightly more than an acre of prime real estate: the Maryland Avenue beach",Mostly True,"September 5, 2011"
"""The United States is the No. 1 country in the world for energy resources. … We are the king daddy dogs when it comes to energy.""","
During an Aug. 27, 2011, appearance in the central Florida town of Poinciana, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn. -- a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination -- made a striking claim about the United States’ energy resources.

According to an Associated Press story, Bachmann said that ""the United States is the No. 1 country in the world for energy resources,"" arguing that, in shale deposits alone, the United States easily outstrips the total oil supply of Saudi Arabia. ""That doesn't even include … all the oil in Alaska.""

Bachmann added, ""Instead of thinking we are beggars out here begging for oil and for energy, we are the king daddy dogs when it comes to energy. The radical environmentalists have demanded that we lock up all our energy resources. President Bachmann will take that key out of the door. I will unlock it.""

Several readers asked us to look at whether the U.S. is in fact ""the No. 1 country in the world for energy resources.""

First, some background on how energy resources are measured. We found a concise explanation in a report issued on Nov. 30, 2010, by the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of Congress. (According to a different Associated Press article, Bachmann actually cited the CRS report during her Poinciana event.)

""It is important to keep in mind that naturally occurring deposits of any material, whether it is fossil fuels, gold, or timber, comprise a broad spectrum of concentration, quality, and accessibility (geologic, technical, and cultural),"" CRS wrote. The report’s authors suggested visualizing this notion as a pyramid -- a small amount of easily recoverable resources at the top, with increasingly large deposits that are more and more difficult to extract toward the base of the pyramid.

Energy experts use a variety of technical terms that describe how easily and how economically feasible it is to extract a given resource. Here are a few of the more common terms, in descending order of cost-effectiveness:

• Proved reserves. This refers to estimates made with ""reasonable certainty"" to be ""commercially recoverable"" under current economic and governmental conditions.

• Undiscovered, economically recoverable resources. These are resources that are expected to be found eventually based on geological features of a given location and which are likely to be economically feasible once recovery proceeds.

• Undiscovered, technically recoverable resources. These are resources that are expected to be found eventually based on geological features of a given location and which are likely to be recoverable but which will not necessarily be recoverable on an economically feasible basis.

We looked at detailed international comparisons compiled by the Energy Information Administration, the statistical office of the U.S. Department of Energy. We’ll look at the data for three fossil fuels -- petroleum, natural gas and coal. We won’t look at renewable energy (such as biomass, geothermal, hydropower, solar or wind) because it’s difficult to make international comparisons for renewable energy that countries could potentially harness.

Petroleum: U.S. petroleum reserves are relatively small -- less than 21 billion barrels. By comparison, the top four are Saudi Arabia (263 billion barrels), Venezuela (211 billion), Canada (175 billion), and Iran (137 billion).

Natural gas: The U.S. does better on this score. It has 273 trillion cubic feet of proved reserves, ranking fourth in the world behind Iran (1,046 trillion cubic feet), Qatar (896 trillion cubic feet) and Saudi Arabia (276 trillion cubic feet). All told, the U.S. accounts for 4 percent of the world total.

Coal: This is where the U.S. can lay its most plausible claim to be ""king daddy dog."" The EIA’s international comparison -- which uses the more relaxed standard of recoverable coal rather than proved reserves -- the U.S. has 260 billion short tons of coal. Its closest competitors are Russia (173 billion short tons) and China (126 billion short tons). The U.S. possesses a whopping 27 percent of the world total.

Using a different data set, we also looked at the world reserves of uranium, the material used for nuclear reactors. According to the World Nuclear Association, the U.S. has 342,000 tons of ""known, recoverable"" uranium. That’s 6 percent of the world total, ranking sixth in the world behind Australia (23 percent of the world total), Kazakhstan (15 percent), Russia (10 percent), South Africa (8 percent) and Canada (8 percent).

In its report, CRS made a couple attempts to make the kind of comprehensive, international comparison Bachmann made. Doing so requires some mathematical adjustments so that the figures for oil, natural gas and coal can be added together. This is done by adjusting the numbers for the amount of energy each resource produces. The unit of measurement CRS used is ""barrels of oil equivalent.""

CRS concluded that the U.S. had about 973 billion barrels of oil equivalent in its reserves, which ranks first in the world. Russia was a close second at 955 billion and China a distant third with 475 billion.

The U.S. also ranked first using a different measurement -- one that takes the reserves total from the previous calculation and adds to it technically recoverable (but not necessarily economically feasible) undiscovered oil and natural gas. CRS did not include technically recoverable, undiscovered coal in this calculation, even though it could be a substantial resource, because it found the data too speculative.

By this measurement, the U.S. also ranked first in the world with 1.3 trillion barrels of oil equivalent, once again narrowly leading Russia, which had 1.2 trillion. Saudi Arabia, China and Iran ranked third, fourth and fifth, trailing the U.S. and Russia by large margins.

These two comparisons demonstrate that Bachmann has justification for saying that ""the United States is the No. 1 country in the world for energy resources.""

""Directionally, I think she is right,"" said Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy Forum at Rice University’s James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy. ""We have giant energy resources here.""

At the same time, the CRS report offers caveats that undercut such a broad-brush conclusion. Here are some of them:

• Uncertain measurements. Not only is the science of estimating reserves and potentially recoverable resources subject to conjecture, but there’s no guarantee that every country’s data is reliable, since not every nation has put the same effort into researching the question -- or, if they have, they may not be interested in sharing accurate information with economic rivals. In addition, the data is old, CRS says. ""There has been no reliable source for estimates of undiscovered oil and natural gas resources internationally since the U.S. Geological Survey completed its World Petroleum Assessment in 2000,"" CRS wrote.

• The role of coal. The United States’ top ranking owes much to its lead in coal. But coal’s uses are limited since, barring some undiscovered technological advance, it cannot be used to power automobiles and other vehicles. ""Not now nor in the near future will coal be a fuel source for transportation, as oil is,"" said Robin Dutta, research associate at the University of Delaware’s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy. Because of this, Dutta called it ""a false comparison"" to compare, say, Saudi Arabia’s reserves to those in the United States.

In addition, coal’s future viability as a fuel is somewhat in question because it is believed to be a major contributor of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Many scientists believe that the impact of carbon dioxide emissions poses a serious ecological threat by promoting climate change, particularly on a long-term time scale.

• How economical will extraction be? There are large and potentially recoverable troves of fossil fuels in the United States, but there’s a question about whether, and how soon, they’ll be economically viable. Citing oil shale and methane hydrate resources as examples, CRS said that ""the uncertainty associated with estimates of those deposits is too great to produce meaningful comparisons. … The final tally would have very little meaning considering the difficulties in estimating those resources.""

Also unknown is how much of an environmental cost there would be to extraction, or how much government investment would be necessary if the industry considered it uneconomical on its own terms.

• Non-fossil fuels. We noted that the CRS study didn’t measure nuclear energy or conventional forms of renewable energy such as solar, wind or biomass. Nor did it include more experimental technologies, such as energy from ocean waves, or even nuclear fusion. In the long term, one or more of these technologies may become more important than the fossil fuels we’re assessing here -- but we don’t know which one, or what nation will be best positioned to take advantage of the new methods.

With its many windy and sunny locations, the U.S. could conceivably continue as the ""king daddy dog"" into a new era of renewable energy. But saying that today would be more speculative than certain.

Our ruling

Bachmann can point to some very specific numbers from a credible source -- CRS -- that place the United States first in the world in fossil-fuel reserves. But while she cited this big number from the CRS report at Poinciana, she also glossed over a number of caveats that raise questions about the significance of the No. 1 ranking.

The U.S. lead is predominantly due to its large stores of coal, yet coal’s environmental effects pose a question mark for the future use of these resources. Meanwhile, for both coal and other fossil fuels, there’s continuing uncertainty about whether the U.S. will be able to exploit these resources in a way that’s economically feasible. Finally, there’s no way of knowing which renewable or experimental energy sources will become important in the future, and as a result, whether the U.S. will be well placed to dominate the field.

We find Bachmann’s statement supportable based on available statistics, but the statistics may not be completely reliable. Some of the estimates include resources that would not be tapped if companies found it more profitable to exploit resources outside the U.S. We consider Bachmann's statement to be accurate, but find that it leaves out important details",Half True,"August 31, 2011"
"Says there’s not ""much evidence to suggest that people have (contributed to global warming) or can do very much to change anything.""","Kevin Coughlin, a former Republican state legislator from Cuyahoga Falls, has been making Ohio’s political rounds this summer in an effort to capture his party’s nod to take on Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown next year.

At an Aug. 18 stop in Strongsville, Coughlin told the Strong Ohio tea party group he believes the science behind global warming is ""sketchy.""

""Scientists who consider themselves to be environmentalists disagree on the science and the impact,"" Coughlin said. ""There is no question that the earth’s core is increasing slightly in temperature.

""But the real question and I think what’s pertinent to the debate in our country and in global politics is how much people really contributed to it and I don’t really think there’s much evidence to suggest that people have or can do very much to change anything.""

That got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention.  

We contacted Coughlin, whose appearance was captured on video by a Democratic super PAC, American Bridge 21st Century. He acknowledged making the remarks, although he said meant to say the Earth’s atmosphere -- not its core -- is rising in temperature.

But do scientists agree with his assertion that there’s not ""much evidence to suggest that people have or can do very much to change anything.""

Many Republican politicians apart from Coughlin assert that scientists disagree whether human actions contribute to global warming.

Before he dropped out of the GOP presidential primary last month, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty told the Miami Herald newspaper ""the science is in dispute"" over ""how much, if any"" climate change can be blamed on human behavior. At an Aug. 17 New Hampshire campaign stop, Texas Gov. Rick Perry said that scientists are regularly ""coming forward and questioning the original idea that man-made global warming is what is causing the climate to change.""

PolitiFact examined these claims by Pawlenty and Perry, and found them to be False. That’s because there does appear to be a scientific consensus that people contribute to global warming.

To begin with, a 2007 report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s leading international scientific body on climate science, states: ""Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations. The observed widespread warming of the atmosphere and ocean, together with ice mass loss, support the conclusion that it is extremely unlikely that global climate change of the past 50 years can be explained without external forcing, and very likely that it is not due to known natural causes alone."" (External forcing refers to anything that changes the climate that is outside of the normal climate system.)

A 2009 report from the U.S. Global Change Research Program reached a similar conclusion: ""Observations show that warming of the climate is unequivocal. The global warming observed over the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases. These emissions come mainly from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), with important contributions from the clearing of forests, agricultural practices, and other activities.""

Current climate change research was reviewed again this year by the National Research Council and the National Academy of Sciences. The committee it assembled concluded that global warming poses significant risks and is happening primarily because of greenhouse gas emissions from human activities. It rejected the idea that those findings are in any way questionable.

""Although the scientific process is always open to new ideas and results, the fundamental causes and consequences of climate change have been established by many years of scientific research, are supported by many different lines of evidence, and have stood firm in the face of careful examination, repeated testing, and the rigorous evaluation of alternative theories and explanations,"" the committee’s report said.

A few scientists dispute the IPCC’s conclusions on global warming, but most acknowledge that humans contribute to increased temperatures. They make more nuanced points, like  questioning whether carbon emissions by themselves are enough to boost temperatures, whether other human activities contribute, whether rising temperatures cause severe weather, and whether public policy change is needed to address potential problems.

Climate change skeptics cite an online petition with more than 31,000 signatures to demonstrate their viewpoint is widespread. The petition states ""there’s no convincing scientific evidence"" that human greenhouse gas releases are disrupting the Earth’s climate, and there’s ""substantial evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects"" on Earth’s plants and animals. That petition has been criticized for not checking the credentials of its signatories or even proving they exist.

But surveys of large numbers of climate researchers show a clear consensus among them that humans are causing climate change.

One 2010 study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that 97 to 98 percent out of 1,372 climate researchers who are publishing scientific studies in the field say they believe that human beings are causing climate change, and that the scientific credentials of researchers who doubt that role are ""substantially below that of the convinced researchers.""

A study published the previous year by the American Geophysical Union, asked more than 3,100 scientists whether they think human activity significantly contributes to ""changing mean global temperatures."" About 82 percent of the surveyed scientists answered ""Yes,"" with a 97.4 percent affirmative rate among climate change specialists.

While a few skeptics out there disagree, there’s clear scientific consensus that global warming is occurring and that humans contribute to it",False,"August 31, 2011"
"Scientists are ""questioning the original idea that man-made global warming is what is causing the climate to change. … (It is) more and more being put into question.""","Texas Gov. Rick Perry has made it clear he doesn't believe that human beings are contributing to global warming, and he expounded on the issue in detail at a campaign stop in Bedford, N.H.

""I do believe that the issue of global warming has been politicized,"" Perry said. ""I think there are a substantial number of scientists who have manipulated data so that they will have dollars rolling into their projects. I think we're seeing it almost weekly or even daily, scientists who are coming forward and questioning the original idea that man-made global warming is what is causing the climate to change.""

He added that plans to address climate change by limiting carbon emissions would cost ""billions, if not trillions"" and that America should not spend that much money on ""scientific theory that has not been proven and from my perspective is more and more being put into question.""

Perry is the latest candidate to enter the race for the Republican nomination for president, announcing on Aug. 13, 2011, that he is running. Perry has served as the Texas governor since 2000.

So is Perry correct? Is there significant disagreement on the causes of global warming?

We looked at this question in some detail in a previous fact-check on candidate Tim Pawlenty, who has since dropped out of the race. Pawlenty said, ""The weight of the evidence is that most of it, maybe all of it, is because of natural causes ... it's fair to say the science is in dispute."" We rated that statement False. This report reviews much of the same evidence.

We'll start with the basics.

One of the most oft-cited reports is from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a scientific body considered the leading international organization on climate science. It includes the scientific consensus of thousands of researchers from 194 countries.

""Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations,"" the most recent report states. ""The observed widespread warming of the atmosphere and ocean, together with ice mass loss, support the conclusion that it is extremely unlikely that global climate change of the past 50 years can be explained without external forcing, and very likely that it is not due to known natural causes alone."" (External forcing refers to anything outside of the normal climate system that changes the climate, including the results of human activity, sunspots or volcanic eruptions.)

In the United States, the U.S. Global Change Research Program coordinates and integrates federal research on climate. Its 2009 report mirrored the IPCC's conclusions: ""Observations show that warming of the climate is unequivocal. The global warming observed over the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases. These emissions come mainly from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), with important contributions from the clearing of forests, agricultural practices, and other activities.""

Earlier this year, a committee organized by the National Research Council and the National Academy of Sciences again reviewed the current research on climate change. The committee concluded that climate change is occurring, that it is caused primarily by the emission of greenhouse gases from human activities, and that it poses significant risks for a range of human and natural systems. It specifically rejected the view that that those findings are in some way questionable.

""Although the scientific process is always open to new ideas and results, the fundamental causes and consequences of climate change have been established by many years of scientific research, are supported by many different lines of evidence, and have stood firm in the face of careful examination, repeated testing, and the rigorous evaluation of alternative theories and explanations,"" the committee said.

We asked the Perry campaign for comment on this, but we didn't hear back. In response to similar questions from the Washington Post, the Perry campaign pointed to various writings questioning climate change. But the Post's report noted these writings were anecdotal and ""not evidence of the groundswell of opposition suggested by Perry."" We concur.

To be clear, we're not saying that no scientists -- as in zero -- dispute climate change is caused by human activity.  We looked into the work of the most prominent and best credentialed people who have questioned the IPCC's conclusions on global warming. Generally speaking, even these scientists do not claim that humans are making no contribution at all to rising temperatures. Rather, they tend to make more nuanced points. They question whether carbon emissions alone are driving up temperatures, or whether other human activities contribute as well. They question whether extreme weather events such as storms or floods can be conclusively linked to rising temperatures. And, they question whether significant changes to public policy are necessary as a means of coping with rising temperatures.

Climate change skeptics also have their own petition, commonly called the Oregon petition, that has been endorsed by 31,000 signers opposing restrictions on carbon emissions. But that petition has been criticized for not checking the credentials of its signatories or even proving that all the signatories exist.

Several scientific studies have attempted to quantify just how much agreement there is among scientists when it comes to climate change.

A 2010 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences -- the official publication of the United States National Academy of Sciences -- found that out of 1,372 climate researchers under review, approximately 97 to 98 percent of those actively publishing in the field said they believe human beings are causing climate change, which they term anthropogenic (i.e., man-made) climate change. It also concluded that ""the relative climate expertise and scientiﬁc prominence"" of the researchers unconvinced of man-made climate change are ""substantially below that of the convinced researchers.""

An earlier survey published in the 2009 issue of Eos -- a publication of the American Geophysical Union -- asked scientists from a wide range of disciplines (approximately 3,146): ""Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?"" Approximately 82 percent of the surveyed scientists answered yes to this question. Of those climate change specialists surveyed, 97.4 percent answered yes.

Perry also charged that scientists have been manipulating data. He could be referring to a 2009 incident when stolen e-mails from the Climatic Research United at the University of East Anglia were released on the Internet. Global warming skeptics said the e-mails showed climate researchers were manipulating data.

But several inquiries debunked those allegations, including investigations by the British Parliament, the U.S. Department of Commerce, Pennsylvania State University and the InterAcademy Council. The inquiries found that, while the scientists had made rude remarks about people who questioned climate change, they were not falsifying data. Some of the investigations recommended greater transparency and sharing of climatic data, but the independent investigations exonerated the researchers of falsifying data.

Perry's remarks give the impression that the science of global warming is in dispute, that some scientists feel one way, and some scientists feel another way. He says that skepticism is growing. In fact, our research shows that's not the case. We found that there is solid consensus among the major scientific organizations and that the skeptics seems to be small minority",False,"August 22, 2011"
"""The weight of the evidence (on global warming) is that most of it, maybe all of it, is because of natural causes ... it’s fair to say the science is in dispute.""","Climate change has become a touchy subject in the Republican primary. Though some candidates once supported plans to reduce carbon emissions, such strategies have fallen out of favor with Republicans in recent years. Even acknowledging that human beings are causing climate change can be politically problematic for some Republicans. Our colleagues at the Miami Herald asked Republican presidential candidate and former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty about his views on climate change in an interview on Aug. 3, 2011. His response piqued our interest:

""Well, there’s definitely climate change. The more interesting question is how much is a result of natural causes and how much, if any, is attributable to human behavior. And that’s what the scientific dispute is about,"" said Pawlenty. ""It’s something we have to look to the science on. The weight of the evidence is that most of it, maybe all of it, is because of natural causes... There’s lots of layers to it. But at least as to any potential man-made contribution to it, it’s fair to say the science is in dispute.""

We divided Pawlenty’s answer into his two essential claims:  

  • Evidence points toward climate change being primarily a natural, rather than man-made, phenomenon.

  • The science about the causes of global climate change is in dispute.

To check the first claim, we turned to the most recent report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a scientific body considered the leading international organization on climate science. ""Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations,"" the 2007 report states. ""The observed widespread warming of the atmosphere and ocean, together with ice mass loss, support the conclusion that it is extremely unlikely that global climate change of the past 50 years can be explained without external forcing, and very likely that it is not due to known natural causes alone."" (External forcing refers to anything that changes the climate that is outside of the normal climate system.)

In the United States, the U.S. Global Change Research Program coordinates and integrates federal research on climate. Its 2009 report mirrored the IPCC’s conclusions: ""Observations show that warming of the climate is unequivocal. The global warming observed over the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases. These emissions come mainly from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), with important contributions from the clearing of forests, agricultural practices, and other activities.""

The IPCC report states that the period from 1995 to 2006 contains 11 of the 12 warmest years on record since instrumental measurement began in 1850. It concluded that global surface temperature rose 0.76 degrees Celsius from the end of the 19th century (1850-1899) to the beginning of the 21st (2001-2005).  The U.S. Global Change Research Program’s report similarly found that the average global temperature increase by 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since 1900.

While these temperature changes may sound small, keep in mind that these are averages. The rise in temperature, and its visible effects, are more pronounced in certain parts of the world than in others. The polar ice sheets are particularly vulnerable to temperature increases. Greenland lost 36 to 60 cubic miles of ice from 2002 to 2006 while Antarctica lost 36 cubic miles of ice during roughly the same time period.

Brian Soden, a professor of meteorology and physical oceanography at the University of Miami, was one of the many scientific contributors to the 2007 IPCC report.

""The rise in global mean temperature since the 19th century may seem small, and projections of global mean warming over the next century range from 2 to 5 degrees Celsius,"" Soden said. ""One way to put these numbers into perspective is to realize that the current climate is now only about 5 degrees Celsius warmer than it was during the last ‘glacial maximum’ (approximately 20,000 years ago) when ice covered much of North America extending all the way down to St Louis.""

If you’ve been following the debate recently, you may remember that climate research on temperature was called into question in 2009 when stolen e-mails from the Climatic Research United at the University of East Anglia were released on the Internet. Global warming skeptics said the e-mails showed climate researchers were manipulating data.

But several inquiries debunked those allegations, including those conducted by the British Parliament, the U.S. Department of Commerce, Pennsylvania State University, and the InterAcademy Council. The inquiries found that while the scientists had made rude remarks about people who questioned climate change, they were not falsifying data. A few reports recommended greater transparency and sharing of climatic data, but the independent investigations exonerated the researchers of falsifying data.

We looked into the work of the most prominent and best credentialed people who have questioned the IPCC’s conclusions on global warming. Generally speaking, even these scientists do not claim that humans are making no contribution at all to rising temperatures. Rather, they tend to make more nuanced points. They question whether carbon emissions alone are driving up temperatures, or whether other human activities contribute as well. They question whether extreme weather events such as storms or floods can be conclusively linked to rising temperatures. And, they question whether significant changes to public policy are necessary as a means of coping with rising temperatures.

For Pawlenty’s second claim -- that there is dispute about the causes of climate change -- we decided to look at the opinions of world scientists about the issue.

Several studies have attempted to quantify how much agreement there is among scientists when it comes to climate change.

A  2010 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences - the official publication of the United States National Academy of Sciences - found that out of 1,372 climate researchers surveyed, approximately 97 to 98 percent of those actively publishing in the field said they believe human beings are causing the climate change, which they term anthropogenic (i.e., man-made) climate change.  It also concluded that ""the relative climate expertise and
scientiﬁc prominence"" of the researchers unconvinced of man-made climate change are ""substantially below that of the convinced researchers.""

An earlier survey published in the 2009 issue of Eos -- a publication of the American Geophysical Union -- surveyed scientists from a wide range of disciplines (approximately 3,146) and asked: ""Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?"" Approximately 82 percent of the surveyed scientists answered yes to this question. Of those climate change specialists surveyed, 97.4 percent answered yes to this question.

Climate change skeptics have their own petition, commonly called the Oregon petition, that has been endorsed by 31,000 signers opposing restrictions on carbon emissions. But that petition has been criticized for not checking the credentials of its signatories or proving that the signatories exist.

To be clear, we’re not saying that no scientists dispute man-made climate change. When we contacted the Pawlenty campaign, they pointed us to several published pieces, such as writings by John R. Christy, who was counted as a dissenting researcher as part of the 2010 study from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

But these skeptics seem to be a small -- even tiny -- minority, in contrast to Pawlenty’s comments suggesting significant disagreement. Many of the skeptics agree that climate change is occurring and that human activities play a part. But they disagree with some of the conclusions formulated in mainstream climate science.

To summarize: Based on our research, there is very little dispute in the scientific community, especially among climate specialists, on whether climate change is primarily caused by natural or man-made forces. The overwhelming majority of scientists polled feel that human activity is the primary driver of climate change. Also, based on scientific studies by the IPCC and others, global warming over the past 50 years has been primarily driven by human activity.

Based upon the preponderance of evidence we conclude that Tim Pawlenty’s claims are both incorrect and misleading to the public, who may not be familiar with the science behind climate change.  It is not ""fair to say the science is in dispute,"" as if there are good arguments on both sides. Rather, there is significant scientific consensus that human beings are contributing to global warming",False,"August 14, 2011"
"""You might be surprised to know that 137 billion gallons flows (into Lake Erie) every day. You might be surprised to know that only 86.3 billion gallons flow out. ... Leaving us a net surplus of approximately 50 billion gallons a day.""","
Who knew water could be so political?

It's happened this year in Ohio as a debate over how to best use -- or not use -- the fresh water supplies of Lake Erie and the Great Lakes as a whole has raged in the hallways of the Ohio Statehouse.

The debate has focused on House Bill 231, a piece of legislation that was supposed to implement the eight-state Great Lakes Compact that Ohio agreed to be a part of in 2008. The legislation was approved by the General Assembly, but then vetoed July 15, 2011, by Gov. John Kasich.

Environmental groups as well as former Govs. Bob Taft and George Voinovich have fought the legislation, saying it allows businesses to use too much water without permits and could cause Lake Erie water levels to drop, leaving it  prone to algae problems.

Leading the charge for the legislation has been Sen. Tim Grendell, a Chesterland Republican, who has used a steady stream of statistics about water flowing in and out of Lake Erie to suggest that criticisms are overblown.
 
On June 28, before the Ohio Senate voted, Grendell gave a floor speech in support of the bill that suggested Lake Erie takes in more water than the amount that flows out. In fact, Lake Erie actually had a surplus of water, therefore diminishing the arguments of those concerned about water withdrawals made by businesses, Grendell claimed.

""You might be surprised to know that 137 billion gallons flows in every day,"" Grendell said. ""You might be surprised to know that only 86.3 billion gallons flow out. . . . Leaving us a net surplus of approximately 50 billion gallons a day.""

We were surprised to hear more water was flowing into Lake Erie than flowing out. So we decided to check and see if Grendell's figures were high and dry.

Grendell told us that he got his information about the water flowing into the lake  from the Ohio Environmental Council, which in turn got it from a May 2009 summary of a draft report of the International Upper Great Lakes Study prepared by the International Joint Commission.

He said he got his information about the water flowing out from U.S. Geological Survey official Dick Bartz as well as from an unnamed expert with the New York state parks who calculated the amount that flows over Niagara Falls. The expert was contacted by an aide to Rep. Jim Buchy, according to an e-mail Grendell gave to Politifact Ohio. The aide, Justin Barnhart, said the expert was actually Angela Berti, marketing and public affairs coordinator for New York’s state office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, which operates the U.S. side of Niagara Falls.

We dug out the summary of the draft report from the International Upper Great Lakes Study. We quickly found the key document section. But the numbers in the report are measured in cubic meters per second and in thousands of cubic feet per second. In order to convert those numbers into gallons per day, we needed some math help, as we were clearly out of our depth. (Hard to fathom, we know.).

So we turned to Bartz, the U.S. Geological Survey official who was a former Chief of the Division of Water of ODNR under Gov. Taft.

Bartz calculated the numbers in the report to show that about 137 billion gallons of water flows into Lake Erie from the Detroit River and from runoff to the lake and smaller tributaries. That's exactly the number Grendell used on the Senate floor.

So Grendell was right on how much flows in?

Not so fast. There is also about 16.8 billion gallons worth of rainfall that make it into the lake, according to Bartz's calculation of the report's numbers. So the average daily total amount of water flowing into Lake Erie is about 154 billion gallons.

To figure how much flowed out of the lake each day, Grendell took a pair of calculations that Bartz did for evaporation (16.8 billion gallons a day) and the amount used by Ohioans each day (3.54 billion gallons a day) and added to them the 66 billion gallons a day that New York’s Berti said flowed over Niagara Falls.

Berti confirmed to us that she gave Buchy’s office ""commonly accepted"" numbers of gallons of water a second that go over the falls collectively known as Niagara Falls. Her gallons per second estimates, taken from the state’s website, work out to 65.5 billion gallons a day.

That math gave Grendell about 86 billion gallons, roughly 50 billion gallons a day less then what he said was flowing into Lake Erie.

However, Bartz said that equation is off.

He agreed that Grendell has accurately quoted him as saying there is 16.8 billion gallons of water evaporation. However, he said the 66 billion gallons that Berti calculated flowed over Niagara Falls doesn’t equal all the water that flows from Lake Erie into Lake Ontario.

Bartz said that along with the 66 billion gallons a day that Berti calculated are huge amounts of water diverted to power plants above the falls and then discharged back into Lake Ontario below the falls. In all, Bartz said about 131.8 billion gallons of water flow into Lake Ontario from Lake Erie both over the falls and from the diversions to power plants. Additionally, Bartz calculated that about 5.8 billion gallons of water are diverted by a pair of canals, the Welland Canal in Ontario and the New York State Barge Canal.

Bartz said most of the water that Ohioans use every day eventually makes its way back into the Lake Erie basin so it’s not a key number to use in the equation.

Add it all up -- the water over Niagara Falls, the water diverted around Niagara Falls, the water funneled into two canals canal and the water that evaporates -- and on the average about the same amount of water flows out of Lake Erie as flows into it, Bartz said -- roughly 154 billion gallons a day.

""It's basically about the same,"" Bartz said.

If Grendell's theory were true that more water was flowing into Lake Erie than flowing out that there would be a noticeable effect., Bartz said. ""If there were more coming in than going out we would have seen lake levels rise.""  

Actually, Bartz said Lake Erie water levels were at their highest in the 1970s and have dropped slightly since that time.

So awash in these watery figures, what do we have?

Trying to make his case that Ohio has more water than it could ever use, Grendell asserted that about 137 billion gallons of water a day flowed into Lake Erie and only 86 billion gallons a day flowed out.

However, the acknowledged expert in this area said that Grendell’s math is all wet. The expert calculates the amount of water flowing into lake Erie as roughly the same amount flowing out each day (about 154 billion gallons a day.) If that wasn't the case, we would see a spike in overall Lake Erie water levels rise, which hasn’t happened",False,"August 8, 2011"
"Says state Sen. Alberta Darling is ""allowing mercury to harm our children"" because she voted against an electronics recycling bill.","
The political arm of the Wisconsin Sierra Club is slamming Republican state Sen. Alberta Darling in direct mail pieces that mince few words about the group’s view of her environmental voting record.

She ""looks the other way while corporate polluters ravage our lakes, our rivers and our air."" She’s a ""corporate Darling"" whose actions are ""damaging Wisconsin’s future.""

The claim that jumped out at us involved a 2009 vote on a bill banning disposal of computers, TVs and other electronics in landfills or incinerators. The ""e-waste"" recycling bill put the onus on product manufacturers to collect obsolete goods containing heavy metals and keep them out of the trash.

""Alberta Darling’s Gone Too Far,"" the headline in one mailer reads. ""Allowing Mercury to Harm Our Children.""

Another mailer claims Darling ""voted to allow mercury and other harmful toxins into landfills where they can seep into our water supply.""

With these accusations flooding mailboxes in the weeks before the August 9, 2011, recall election between Darling and state Rep. Sandy Pasch, D-Whitefish Bay, we thought we’d take a look.

The ban and recycling program passed 23-10 with little fanfare and some bipartisan support in June 2009 and was signed by Gov. Jim Doyle. Five Republican senators joined the majority. Twenty-five states, including Minnesota, now have such programs.

Darling felt the fees and recycling requirements on manufacturers were excessive, said Andrew Davis, her campaign manager.

In the end, Darling, as the Sierra Club claims, did vote against the bill.

But the main thrust of the claim is that her ""allowing mercury to harm our children"" vote will ""allow mercury and other harmful toxins into landfills where they can seep into our water supply.""

The political director of the Sierra Club, David Blouin, said the claim is justified because the goal of the bill was to keep mercury and other toxins out of the waste supply.

""If it’s going into landfills, which all eventually leak, that threatens our water supplies,"" Blouin said. ""Any increase (in mercury waste) via reduction of regulation allows mercury to harm our kids, or potentially could.""

That’s a strong statement, but with a couple of big ""ifs.""

Let’s examine the evidence.

The nonpartisan U.S. General Accountability Office in 2005 reviewed studies on e-waste and found that, by one account, 100 million computers, monitors, and televisions become obsolete each year and that the level is growing. Research showed two major concerns: the loss of natural resources such as copper, and the potential release of toxic substances in the environment.

""EPA has identified lead, mercury, and cadmium (which are typically found in computers or monitors), as priority toxic chemicals for reduction under an agency program, the GAO reported. ""According to EPA, these toxic substances do not break down when released into the environment and can be dangerous, even in small quantities.""

EPA’s website says that some electronics (such as color CRT computer monitors, color CRT TV tubes, and smaller items such as cell phones and other ""hand-helds"") test ""hazardous"" under federal law.

The GAO report says that the Solid Waste Association of North America found an apparent increase in lead from used electronics showing up in municipal landfills. And ""tests conducted at the University of Florida indicate that lead leachate from color computer monitors and televisions with CRTs""... could be considered hazardous waste under federal rules.

But GAO added that the Florida researcher cautioned that his findings don’t necessarily mean it would leak from a modern landfill. And GAO noted that the Solid Waste Association declares municipal landfills as safe for managing used electronics ""without exceeding toxicity limits.""

The GAO’s bottom line: ""Regarding the issue of toxicity, the research we reviewed is unclear on the extent to which toxic substances may leach from used electronics in landfills.""

We heard the same kind of terminology about possible risks from other experts:

A Congressional Research Service report to lawmakers in 2002 said that ""disposal of these products, when they become ""e-waste""
at the end of their useful lives poses major potential environmental problems.""

""There is a possibility eventually that metals leach out over time,"" said Sarah Murray, a Wisconsin DNR employee who heads Wisconsin’s e-cycle program. That’s what drove states to implement the laws.

The new program ended an exemption for households and electronics disposal. The new program, Murray said, has boosted recycling through drop-off programs: 30 million pounds of various categories of electronics have been recycled since the law kicked in.

""It’s hard to say absolutely that there is less in landfills, but people have used it,"" Murray said.

Barbara Kyle, national coordinator of the San Francisco-based Electronics TakeBack Coalition, called e-waste laws common sense preventive measures. In Wisconsin, Kyle said, there was little resistance by manufacturers to the bill.

""It could cause harm, and it’s a waste of resources,"" she said. ""Can you prove it ever got into the water stream? No, you can’t prove a link because (electronics) are all crunched up with other garbage.""

We’ll give the final word to Brad Wolbert, Wisconsin DNR’s chief of recycling and solid waste.

Wolbert told us it’s true that landfill liners don’t last forever. And it’s true, he said, that mercury can get into landfill gas and escape. And DNR believes it makes sense to divert electronics from landfills.

But it’s a stretch to say that harm has already come, or will come, to anyone from metals in discarded electronics, Wolbert said.

""Nobody knows,"" he said.

Let’s dig out.

There’s little doubt that disposal of electronic products is a serious environmental issue involving hazardous substances.

There is an element of truth in that Darling voted against the bill that aims to prevent harm. The Sierra Club mailers, though, push past what is known and attack Darling for ""allowing mercury to harm our children.""

 That day could come -- or not. But nobody claims it has already arrived",Mostly False,"August 5, 2011"
"""One of the biggest polluters in our country is the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District.""","
As a handler of human waste -- which it periodically dumps into Lake Michigan untreated -- the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District is less popular among some people than mosquitoes.

But is the taxpayer-funded agency one of the nation’s largest polluters?

On July 24, 2011, U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., held a town hall meeting in Whitefish Bay, a Milwaukee suburb. A woman told the 33-year congressman she was ""appalled at the continued gutting of good government regulation and awarding corporations who pollute and not holding them accountable,"" according to Patch.com, a website that covers community news.

Sensenbrenner said corporations are not the only ones to blame, adding:

""I get sick and tired of people saying that people are dumping sewage in our water when one of the biggest polluters in our country is the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District.""

Sensenbrenner later called MMSD a ""disgrace,"" prompting applause as well as objections from the audience, based on a video clip posted on YouTube.

But was the criticism on target?

We’ll first point out that the sewerage district doesn’t generate the pollution in question; its job is to treat it. But sometimes the district is treated like other polluters. Federal and state regulators have taken action against MMSD and other sewerage districts when they dump more untreated sewage and storm water than their government permits allow.   

With $3.5 billion in capital assets to treat sewage and help control flooding, MMSD serves 1.1 million customers in 28 communities in southeastern Wisconsin. In 2011, the agency has budgeted $242 million in property tax money for capital projects and $82 million in sewer service fees for operations.

Most people probably give the sewerage district little thought -- until heavy rainstorms bring news that MMSD has allowed millions of gallons of untreated sewage and storm water to flow into Lake Michigan and rivers.

Large rainfaills lead to the so-called combined overflows because the agency closes the gates to its $1.3 billion deep tunnel when the accumulated water nears the tunnel’s 521-million-gallon capacity. The most recent episode occurred over two days in June 2011, when the sewer district said an estimated 170.5 million gallons of untreated waste water overflowed following storms.

Overflows pose potential health risks. A 2010 study published by researchers at the Medical College of Wisconsin, the Great Lakes WATER Institute and the Children’s Research Institute found an estimated 11 percent increase in the number of emergency room visits by children for acute gastrointestinal illness four days after rainfalls. That study cited untreated sewage releases as only one potential link to the illnesses. However, a 2007 Medical College of Wisconsin study concluded that such untreated waste water releases were ""potentially harmful"" because, in two of six releases examined, the number of children who went to emergency room for diarrhea ""increased significantly.""

Sensenbrenner has been critical of MMSD in the past.

In 2003, he lambasted the EPA for giving MMSD a ""clean water partner"" award not long after the sewerage district had been reprimanded for dumping. In 2005, when Sensenbrenner requested $68 million in federal flood control funds for MMSD, he emphasized that the agency had dumped ""billions of gallons of waste into Lake Michigan"" over the previous 10 years.

We asked Sensenbrenner’s spokeswoman, Amanda Infield, for evidence to back her boss’ claim about MMSD as a polluter and she he made three points. We asked Bill Graffin, MMSD’s spokesman, to respond and did our own research.

MMSD’s dumping

Infield said that from 1994 through late July 2011, MMSD dumped 24.2 billion gallons of untreated sewage and storm water into Lake Michigan.

Graffin said that accurately quotes MMSD’s own statistics, which show that annual combined overflows have been as high as 4.38 billion gallons since 1994. That is down from overflows ranging from 7 billion to 9 billion gallons per year from 1990 through 1993.

Graffin said three other Midwestern cities, Cleveland, Indianapolis and Chicago, all have larger annual overflows than Milwaukee, such that they are being forced to make major treatment upgrades because of enforcement action by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Documents show that MMSD’s counterpart in Cleveland, which releases nearly 5 billion gallons of untreated sewage per year, agreed in December 2010 to spend $3 billion; and the City of Indianapolis agreed in 2006, when overflows were nearly 8 billion gallons per year, to spend $1.73 billion. That figure was reduced in December 2010 to save Indianapolis $444 million.

In Chicago, MMSD’s counterpart is under fire for its sewage dumping into the Chicago River. According to a New York Times article, in May 2011 the EPA ordered state regulators to impose stricter water quality standards on the river; environmental groups filed a lawsuit charging that Chicago’s waste water agency regularly violates the federal Clean Water Act; and an environmental group named the Chicago River one of the ""most endangered rivers"" in the country.

Conversely, MMSD was last part of a legal stipulation in 2001. The agency finished making upgrades to its facilities required under the stipulation in 2010, Graffin said.

Graffin also cited a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article on a 2006 study by the Sierra Legal Defense Fund, a Canadian conservation group. The article said Milwaukee was far from the worst polluter in the Great Lakes. The study gave Milwaukee a C-plus rating, ranking it in the top half of the 20 Great Lakes cities evaluated for sewage management. Milwaukee was at the top of all the large cities surveyed, according to the article.

So, while MMSD sometimes does dump untreated waste water into Lake Michigan, Sensenbrenner provided no evidence comparing MMSD to other polluters. It’s also clear that in the Great Lakes area alone, Milwaukee is far from being the worst polluter.

BP comparison

Sensenbrenner’s spokeswoman said the amount of waste water MMSD dumped into Lake Michigan in one week was 10 times the amount of oil spilled by BP in the disastrous Gulf of Mexico spill in April 2009. She cited a news report from WTMJ-TV (Channel 4) in Milwaukee that said 2.1 billion gallons of untreated sewage and storm water were dumped into Lake Michigan following storms that caused flooding in July 2010. That amounted to about 75 percent of the overflows for the year.

The 2.1 billion gallons is more than 10 times the 170 million gallons of oil spilled by BP in the Gulf of Mexico. But measurements don’t tell the whole story. One important difference: What MMSD dumps includes contaminants, but it is mostly water; BP spilled oil.

A presidential commission that investigated the BP incident said in a January 2011 report that the spill was the largest accidental marine oil spill in U.S. history. The spill was so massive, the report says, that it will take decades just to assess the environmental damage, leaving aside the tens of billions of dollars in economic damage caused.

So, aside from noting the difference in volume, Sensenbrenner provided no evidence to establish that one MMSD overflow was somehow worse than what is regarded as one of the nation’s worst environmental accidents.

Spoiled beaches

Sensenbrenner’s spokeswoman said southeastern Wisconsin has some of the most polluted beaches in the nation. She cited a 2011 report by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental action group. The report labeled 13 beaches in seven states as ""repeat offenders"" for having high bacteria levels from 2006 through 2010. Two of the beaches were in southeastern Wisconsin, including one -- South Shore in Milwaukee -- that is in MMSD’s service area.

The report does not mention the sewerage district but seems to implicate the agency, saying ""chronically high bacteria counts indicate that the beach water is probably contaminated with human or animal waste.""

The Great Lakes WATER Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee says, however, that sewage overflows are not the primary cause of beach advisories and closings.

The main causes at many Milwaukee-area beaches are waste from gulls and storm water runoff, according to the institute. In addition, the EPA said in a 2007 report to Congress that sewer overflows were the source of pollution in only 3 percent of the beach advisories and closings in Milwaukee County from 2000 to 2004.

So, like the other points, that one does not stand up to scrutiny.
 
We wondered whether there were rankings of the nation’s worst water polluters, but Josh Mogerman, spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said he was not aware of any. We did find a June 2011 report about MMSD by the Public Policy Forum, a government watchdog and research organization in Milwaukee.

The report focused on the sewerage district’s financial condition. But it also found that, according to national data, MMSD’s ""sewage and treatment capacity offers greater protection from sewage overflows than most other districts.""

So where does all of this leave us?

Upset about how much untreated waste water goes into Lake Michigan, Sensenbrenner called the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District ""one of the biggest polluters in our country."" He cited the amount of dumping MMSD has done, but provided no evidence that it ranks among the nation’s top polluters.

To be sure, MMSD does dump untreated sewage -- along with collected rainwater -- in the lake when its system reaches capacity. But Sensenbrenner’s claim was one of magnitude, comparing the district to all other polluters nationwide. We found evidence indicating that MMSD is not even among the worst sewerage district polluters in the Great Lakes region",False,"August 3, 2011"
"""Fracturing or horizontally fracturing the shale to open up larger pockets of natural gas ... has been used for over 60 years and, as of 2009, over 80,000 wells have been fracked in Ohio.""","
During a recent debate in the Ohio Senate over a proposed law to allow drilling at state parks, some lawmakers focused on fracking, an increasingly controversial technique used to extract oil and gas from underground.

Republican Sen. Kris Jordan was among those to defend process. He questioned why Democrats and others were so worried, considering fracking’s long history in Ohio.

""The process of fracturing or horizontally fracking the shale to open up larger pockets of natural gas in order to make it financially feasible to drill the wells – this process has been used for over 60 years and, as of 2009, over 80,000 wells have been fracked in Ohio,"" Jordan said on the Senate floor on June 15.

Considering that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is studying hydraulic fracturing’s effects on drinking water and since fracking will remain a topic of interest as more oil and gas companies are expected to tap Ohio’s natural gas deposits, PolitiFact Ohio decided to look at Jordan’s claim.

So what is fracking?

Fracking -- hydraulic fracturing -- is a technique that uses a combination of water, sand and chemicals to free up natural gas or oil beneath the surface.

First, a well is drilled. Then, the fluid is shot down the well at high pressure, causing rock formations to crack and release natural gas or oil. The fracking fluid is then either recycled, stored in deep underground wells or treated.

Concerns over fracking have grown lately for a variety of reasons. Chesapeake Energy temporarily halted fracking operations in Bradford County, Pa., after a well blew out in April, causing thousands of gallons of fracking fluid to spill into a nearby waterway.

Such incidents have coincided with the increased popularity of the ""Gasland,"" a documentary made in 2010, which attempts to show the environmental dangers of fracking, including a scene about flammable tap water.

We called Jordan to find out more about fracking in Ohio. He said his information came from Thomas Stewart, the Ohio Oil and Gas Association’s executive vice president and lobbyist. ""I’ll trust him as one of the experts,"" Jordan said.

Indeed, we found an April interview in which Stewart said pretty much the same thing as Jordan: ""We’ve been fracturing wells in the state of Ohio since the early 1950s. There’s been over 80,000 wells hydraulically fractured in the state of Ohio,"" Stewart said then.

According to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, which regulates oil and gas drilling in Ohio, hydraulic fracturing in Ohio began 59 years ago in 1952. From that year to 2009, 80,306 wells were hydraulically fractured.

So it appears Jordan is pretty much on the mark. He was a little off when he said fracking has occurred for more than 60 years, the fact remains the technique has been around for decades.

But Jordan’s and Stewart’s statements are not exactly the same. The difference highlights environmentalists’ growing concerns.

Jordan mentioned ""horizontal"" fracturing while Stewart made no such distinction. Stewart actually discussed the differences between vertical and horizontal fracturing in his April interview.

Horizontal fracturing is related to horizontal drilling, a newer drilling method in which a well is first drilled vertically into the ground, then horizontally for thousands of feet. This allows drillers to access more underground resources through a single vertical well.

Of the more than 80,000 Ohio wells that have been fracked, 39 have been horizontally fractured, according to ODNR. The overwhelming majority of fracturing jobs have been for vertical wells.

An ODNR geologist and the Ohio Oil and Gas Association say both vertical and horizontal fracturing are equally safe when properly regulated.

But to environmentalists, the difference is important.

Ellen Mee, director of environmental health policy for the Ohio Environmental Council, said the more recent, horizontal fracturing method is more dangerous because it uses more water and more chemicals to extract the gas. And the fracking fluid is shot at a higher pressure.

Mee also noted recent accidents at sites conducting horizontal fracking – a preferred method to extract natural gas from shale formations around Pennsylvania and New York.

""The difference is really quite significant,"" Mee said. ""We’re really talking about a significantly risky endeavor.""

Tom Tomastik, an ODNR geologist, disagreed. He said the potential for problems are the same. Tomastik said past problems with hydraulic fracturing in Ohio were due to faulty well construction rather than perceived flaws in the fracking process. Tomastik said the media has irresponsibly hyped the dangers of fracking.

""It’s made it look like this technology is hazardous and causes all kinds of problems when we can demonstrate that it hasn’t,"" Tomastik said.

In a fact sheet available online, ODNR stresses that none of its water well investigations since 1990 have uncovered problems caused by hydraulic fracturing. The fact sheet also addresses fears that fracking could contaminate drinking waters. It is ""impossible for frack fluid to travel upward thousands of feet, or between rock formations and into freshwater aquifers,"" according to the ODNR.

A recent study by Duke University researchers did show that houses near sites that used horizontal fracturing to extract natural gas in New York and Pennsylvania were more likely to have methane contamination in drinking water systems. But the study failed to directly connect the contamination to fracking activity.

""More research is needed across this and other regions to determine the mechanism(s) controlling the higher methane concentrations we observed,"" the report said.

Where does that leave Jordan’s claim?

Jordan correctly cites the statistic for the number of times hydraulic fracturing has been used on wells in Ohio. And while he overstated the time frame slightly, he wasn’t off by much. His underlying point, though, was that hydraulic fracturing is not new to Ohio and, he argues, that the technique is relatively safe.

But he specifically mentioned horizontal fracturing, which is a much newer technique. When we asked him about the discrepancy, Jordan said he assumed all the fracturing in Ohio was horizontal. ""Maybe I didn’t ask if it was horizontal or vertical,"" Jordan said.

That’s an important fact to know, especially since the state says horizontal fracturing has only been used 39 times in Ohio",Half True,"July 19, 2011"
"""State agencies have not identified one single instance where groundwater has been damaged due to hydraulic fracking.""","
As public debate across the country has bubbled up in recent months over environmental concerns related to hydraulic fracturing — or fracking as it’s becoming widely known — proponents of oil and gas drilling have come rushing to its defense.

The process involves pumping millions of gallons chemical-laced water and sand deep underground into horizontal wells under high pressure to crack open shale,  enabling natural gas extraction.

On June 15, 2011, state Sen. Kris Jordan, a Delaware Republican, defended the process in a floor speech on behalf of legislation that would throw open state parkland to oil and gas drilling.

During his speech, Jordan portrayed the growing concerns of the public — which have been fanned by ""Gasland,"" a controversial documentary on the environmental issues related to the fracking process — as overblown as he pointed to a long track record of safe fracking in Ohio.

""State agencies have not identified one single instance where groundwater has been damaged due to hydraulic fracking,"" Jordan said.

With drilling likely coming soon to Eastern Ohio where the Utica and Marcellus shale formations await possible exploration, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out Jordan’s claim.

We started with Jordan, who stood by his statement.

""From what I understand, none of the cases has come from fracking itself being involved in contaminating any water,"" said Jordan. ""Any problems that have happened have been well construction issues.""

Jordan said he consulted with several people in Ohio’s oil and gas industry including Tom Stewart, a top official with the Ohio Oil and Gas Association for his information.

Stewart and other oil and gas supporters directed us to several recent statements from state and federal EPA officials such as one made recently by Lisa Jackson, President Barack Obama’s top federal Environmental Protection Agency administrator.

During a House committee hearing, Jackson said evidence was limited on whether hydraulic fracturing can affect water tables and aquifers.

""There is evidence it can certainly affect them. I am not aware of any proven case where the fracking process itself impacted water although there are investigations ongoing,"" she told lawmakers.

The U.S. EPA began a study in January 2011 of possible environmental problems caused by fracking. The first findings from that study aren’t expected until late 2012.

ODNR officials also said they haven’t seen water contamination from fracking in Ohio.

""ODNR’s Oil and Gas Program has not identified any instances of groundwater contamination related to hydraulic fracturing since the technology was first used here in the early 1950s,"" ODNR spokeswoman Heidi Hetzel-Evans said in an email.

When considering these statements, however, it’s important to understand exactly what they are saying—and also what they are not saying.

What they are saying is that there are no documented cases of groundwater contamination directly from the process of pumping the chemical-laced water and sand into the ground to break the rock apart.

They are not talking about the actual drilling of the hole that is fracked or the construction of the drilling well that is used for the fracking process.

""There is definitely a lot of misinformation out there,"" said Hetzel-Evans. ""I don’t think the general public understands that the drilling process isn’t fracking.""

And while there aren’t any groundwater problems due directly to fracking in Ohio, the drilling of wells to prepare for the fracking process has lead to water contamination in at least one case in Ohio. Meanwhile, the first study of its kind in the country is turning up similar evidence.

In December 2007, a home exploded in a residential neighborhood in Bainbridge Township in Geauga County, Ohio. A panel assembled by ODNR ultimately found that a poorly-constructed well casing — think of it as a cement seal around the drill hole -- allowed gas to migrate upwards along the edge of the casing and up the pipe. Ultimately, this gas seeped into the home in Bainbridge and caused the explosion.

Meanwhile, there is new evidence outside of Ohio that poorly constructed drilling wells used for fracking are leading to problems with groundwater.

Duke University researchers found that methane levels were 17 times higher in water wells within one kilometer of hydraulic fracking sites in New York and Pennsylvania than in water wells farther away. The methane levels in those wells showed the same characteristics as methane produced from fracking, as opposed to naturally-occurring methane.  

Robert Jackson, the professor of environmental sciences who headed up the research, said that the ""methane migration"" was likely caused by problems with the casing around the drill hole rather than from the methane migrating thousands of feet through the rock from the fracking zone.

But he wonders whether the new high-pressure water treatment used in fracking could be the cause.

""What I haven’t seen anyone address is whether hydraulic fracturing makes it more likely to cause well casings to leak,"" he said. ""It may be the high pressure involved in fracking makes leaks more common and bigger.""

Meanwhile, the gas exploration boom in Pennsylvania has begun turning up evidence that the shale gas exploration involving the fracking process could be contaminating groundwater supplies with methane.

The state’s Department of Environmental Protection ordered Houston-based Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. to provide and maintain potable water and gas mitigation for residents in Dimock, Pa., who sued over wells polluted in 2009 with methane gas and other contaminants.

Another group, from Lenox Township, Pa., sued Houston-driller Southwestern Energy Co. in 2010  claiming their wells were contaminated with fracking fluids.

Both suits are tied up in court.    

So where does that leave Jordan’s claim that ""state agencies have not identified one single instance where groundwater has been damaged due to hydraulic fracking.""

That statement squares with ODNR’s records.

But regulators in Ohio have linked water contamination problems in at least one incident to other aspects of drilling such as the construction of the drilling wells. That’s additional information that provides clarification",Mostly True,"July 14, 2011"
"""One of the reasons that Budweiser stayed in New Jersey is the money they got from RGGI to put solar on their roof to save on their energy costs.""","The ""King of Beers"" has reigned in Newark for more than half a century.

But according to Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club, Anheuser-Busch’s Budweiser brewery may have been seeking a new home.

Soon after Gov. Chris Christie announced plans to pull New Jersey out of a regional cap-and-trade program, lawmakers, state officials, business leaders and environmental leaders debated the merits of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, during a state assembly committee hearing.

In response to testimony that RGGI, known as ""Reggie,"" was one of the reasons businesses were leaving the state, Tittel said, ""When we talk about businesses, and I know this from first hand, one of the reasons that Budweiser stayed in New Jersey is the money they got from RGGI to put solar on their roof to save on their energy costs.""

RGGI caps the amount of carbon dioxide power plants can emit in 10 states. Credits can be bought or sold if plants need to release more or less carbon dioxide. Proceeds from the sales help participating states fund clean energy initiatives.

PolitiFact New Jersey questioned whether the St. Louis-based beer company had ever considered abandoning its throne in the Garden State and if a reduction in energy costs from solar panels funded by RGGI was one of the reasons that convinced them to stay. Neither was true.

First, let’s note that Anheuser-Busch’s Newark brewery had solar panels installed on its roof.

A May 17, 2010 news release issued by Anheuser-Busch announcing the installation said more than 3,000 photovoltaic solar panels, covering 65,000 square feet, would be capable, at peak production, of ""covering nearly five percent of the brewery's electricity demand."" Orion Energy Systems installed and operate the solar panels, according to the release.

Anheuser-Busch officials quoted in the release talked about how the installation is an example of the company’s commitment to alternate energy sources. There is no mention of the solar panel project swaying the company to stay in New Jersey.

So the brewery had solar panels installed on its roof, but did the beer company receive RGGI funds for the project?

Tittel said his statement was based on a conversation he had with Al Komjathy, a lobbyist with the firm Komjathy & Stewart, which represents Anheuser-Busch, among other companies.

But Komjathy said he never spoke with Tittel about the issue. ""I never had that discussion with him,"" he told PolitiFact New Jersey.

And Anheuser-Busch told us in a statement: ""Our Newark brewery did not receive funding from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative for the solar panel project and there were no plans to relocate the brewery.""

It’s worth noting that Anheuser-Busch applied for funding for a cogeneration power plant at its Newark brewery through the Clean Energy Solutions Capital Investment initiative, a financing program funded by RGGI proceeds and controlled by the state Economic Development Authority. Laura Jones, a spokeswoman for the state Economic Development Authority, said the agency approved Anheuser-Busch’s request, but that the beer company never used the funding.

Tittel said at the time he made the claim about the solar panels, ""I thought it was accurate."" Now, he said, ""most of what I said was accurate but not 100 percent.""

Most? Try little to nothing.

The only thing Tittel got correct in his statement is that solar panels were installed on the roof of Anheuser-Busch’s Newark brewery. Funding for the project did not come from RGGI and the company said it was never considering leaving the state.

Tittel tried to argue that although the brewery did not receive funding through RGGI, legislation, often called ""the RGGI law,"" helped the project.

As part of the project, PSEG Power agreed to purchase solar renewable energy certificates produced by the solar panels, according to PSEG spokesman Fran Sullivan.

Tittel said he was referring to Section 13 in ""the RGGI law"" -- the section allows electric and utility companies to charge ratepayers for investments they make in energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.

However, a spokesman for the state Board of Public Utilities  told us that because PSEG Power is not regulated, Section 13 does not apply.

Let’s recap.

Tittel claimed one of the reasons Anheuser-Busch’s Budweiser brewery in Newark stayed in New Jersey is because they received funding through RGGI to install solar panels, thereby reducing their energy costs.

Anheuser-Busch told us they weren’t planning on relocating the brewery and that they did not receive funds through RGGI for the solar project",False,"July 4, 2011"
"Phil Puckett ""voted no on sending the EPA a message that they’ve gone too far not once, but twice.""","
The Republican Party of Virginia says state Sen. Phillip P. Puckett, D-Russell, is whistling and cheering as President Barack Obama kills the coal industry.  

The RPV’s attack comes on the heels of warnings from American Electric Power, one of the nation’s largest utilities, that new air quality rules from the Environmental Protection Agency could force the company to shutter as many as 20 coal-fired plants and fire hundreds of employees.     

That’s added fuel to the fire in coal-rich Southwest Virginia, which is served by Applachian Power, an AEP subsidiary. The state GOP has declared war on the EPA for imposing ""job-killing"" regulations and is calling Puckett ""President Obama’s lead cheerleader in Southwest Virginia.""

""He talks a good game on his campaign website, but when Southwest Virginia needed Puckett to stand up for coal jobs, Puckett stood up for President Obama,"" a recent release from the RPV says. ""Phil voted NO on sending the EPA a message that they’ve gone too far, not once, but twice.""

We wondered whether Puckett really did vote twice to back the EPA.

To support the claim, the state GOP points to two identical pieces of legislation from this year’s General Assembly session -- one introduced in the House, the other in the Senate.

The measures, however, make no mention of the EPA or coal.

The GOP release refers to two resolutions calling for a ""repeal amendment"" that were killed in the Democrat-controlled state Senate. The measures called for a U.S. constitutional amendment that would nullify any federal law or regulation at the vote of two-thirds of all the state legislatures.

What does that have to do with coal jobs? Not a lot, other than the fact that if the repeal amendment survived an extremely difficult path to national ratification, then one of the countless regulations two-thirds of the state legislatures could theoretically agree to repeal might be an EPA rule affecting the coal industry.

To date, North Dakota has the only state legislature that has endorsed the repeal amendment, according to Raegan Weber, director of public affairs for the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative organization promoting the constitutional change.

Garren Shipley, a spokesman for the state GOP, said the intent of the repeal amendment was to alert Washington it is encroaching on states’ rights. That’s different from his party’s claim that the amendment's purpose was ""sending the EPA a message that they’ve gone too far"" in regulating the coal industry.

The next problem is that Puckett technically did not vote against the resolution twice -- or even once.

The measure introduced on the Senate side, sponsored by Sen. Ryan T. McDougle, R-Hanover, was killed by a seven-member subcommittee of the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee. Puckett is not a member of the subcommittee and did not participate in its vote.

Puckett is a member, however, of the full 15-member Privileges and Elections Committee. Its chairman -- Sen. Janet Howell, D-Fairfax -- declined a procedural request by GOP senators to resurrect the resolution and allow it to be considered by the full committee.  When Republicans objected, Puckett voted with other Democrats to uphold Howell’s authority to set the docket.

The House version of the resolution, sponsored by Del. James M. LeMunyon, R-Fairfax, was left in the same committee without ever coming up for a vote.  

Shipley conceded to us that Puckett didn’t cast a single vote directly on the repeal amendment, but insisted the Democrat ""did everything he could to prevent it from being brought to the floor.""    

Now, here’s the kicker: Puckett actually sponsored a resolution this year that urged Congress to stop the same type of environmental regulations the state GOP accuses him of supporting.

Puckett’s resolution died in the Senate Rules Committee. It would have urged Congress to  adopt legislation ""prohibiting EPA by any means necessary from regulating greenhouse gas emissions, including if necessary defunding EPA greenhouse gas regulatory activities."" The measure also asked for at least a two-year moratorium on new air quality rules.  

So let’s look back.

The state GOP says Puckett betrayed his Southwest Virginia constituents by voting twice against sending the EPA a message that new regulations would harm the coal industry.

Here’s the reality: The repeal amendment, which the Republicans use as the basis for the claim, has no direct tie to the EPA or coal. It could just as easily apply to any federal law or regulation in existence, from health care reform to playground safety requirements. Puckett didn’t vote twice against the amendment; he didn’t vote on it at all. Lastly, Puckett actually introduced a resolution seeking to achieve the very goal the GOP accuses him of opposing.

This one’s more than a stretch, it’s absurd",False Pants on Fire,"June 24, 2011"
"The Medford Water Commission was fined $279,000 for dumping plain drinking water into a stream.","
Recently, state Sen. Doug Whitsett, R-Klamath Falls, excoriated the Department of Environmental Quality at a legislative budget hearing. He called the agency ""out of control"" and cited the following as one small example of DEQ’s lack of common sense:

""In Medford, the Medford Water Commission has been fined $279,000 for the egregious offense of dumping drinking water in Lone Pine Creek. This is a practice that the, Lone Pine Creek is a highly urbanized stream, the Medford Water Commission has been doing this for decades. When it was determined by DEQ that this was some kind of offense, the Medford Water Commission agreed to stop doing it. They were fined almost $300,000 anyway.""

Whitsett’s implication is that DEQ trumped up a charge against the Medford Water Commission, which was just doing what it has done for years and causing no problem to anyone. And even after the commission agreed to stop doing what it thought was legal, DEQ remained unreasonable. We wanted to know if that was indeed the case.

The facts: On Nov. 30, DEQ issued a $278,794 civil penalty against the Medford Water Commission for dumping chlorinated drinking water into Lone Pine Creek. (The commission sends extra water into the creek in the rainy season, when people don’t need as much water.) The water is OK for human consumption, but toxic to fish unable to tolerate the chlorine used to make the water drinkable in the first place. So the agency issued a fat fine, much of it based on the $13,000 annual cost the commission avoided for roughly a dozen years by not dechlorinating the water.

The commission in its appeal basically claimed that it did nothing wrong, and in the alternate, that it didn’t know it was doing anything wrong. The appeal is pending. ""It was plain drinking water,"" said Larry Rains, manager of the Medford Water Commission. ""We're just arguing we thought we were following the rules, (and there is) a disagreement on how those rules are interpreted.""

On the face of it, it looks like a clear violation by the water commission: You can’t divert chlorinated drinking water into fish habitat. But then we put in a call to Sen. Whitsett, who said that the water commission never considered the creek a stream; it was a storm drain.

""The rules have been that if you discharge chlorinated drinking water into a stream, it has to be dechlorinated. If it’s a storm drain, there has to be sufficient time for"" the chlorine to dissipate before it reaches fish habitat, Whitsett said. ""DEQ decided to call it a creek, and not a storm drain.""

So we checked with the department. Jeff Bachman with the agency’s Office of Compliance and Enforcement said there’s no way that Lone Pine Creek is a storm sewer. It’s an ""urbanized stream,"" he said.  

A ""storm sewer"" or ""storm drain"" is a human-made system of channels, conduits, pipes or a mix of the above to control and carry storm water to a waterway.  Bachman said Lone Pine Creek runs underground in a pipe, in a concrete channel through the Rogue Valley International-Medford Airport and in a natural stream channel.

But, he added, even with storm drains you can’t just dump in chlorinated water: ""The Department's policy on disposal of chlorinated water states that such water may be discharged to a storm sewer only if there is no other feasible alternative, such as dechlorination, and if the sewer is long enough such that the chlorine can dissipate during the time it takes the chlorinated water to travel to a water of the state.""   

Again, we’re left to think that DEQ had every right to fine the water commission, although we can see where the confusion may lie. So we called Sen. Alan Bates, D-Ashland, who may be considered more friendly to environmental regulation than Whitsett. But Bates was just as ticked off at the agency as his Republican colleague over Lone Pine Creek.

""It’s never been clear in anyone’s mind what it is,"" Bates said. ""If you think of it as a pristine little creek, that’s sorely not the case. On the other hand, we’re trying to clean up these kinds of areas.""

Bates said it was fine for DEQ to point out the problem so the commission could fix it. But assessing a fine that dates back to 1997? He didn’t get that at all. ""DEQ over-reached. They’ve lost their mind and put this huge fine on people.""
   
Whitsett’s statement is partially true, but lacking an important detail. He’s absolutely right about the amount of the fine, but he left out the fact that the water was chlorinated and unfit for fish habitat. We understand why he would, since he disputes Lone Pine Creek is a stream. On the other hand, as DEQ points out, people can’t just dump chlorinated drinking water into storm drains either",Half True,"June 18, 2011"
"""It’s just crazy that the government will ... make it illegal to use the old [incandescent] bulbs.""","
You’ve heard the jokes before -- how many so-and-so’s does it take to screw in a light bulb?

While light bulbs are remarkably simple to use, new energy efficiency mandates have complicated matters. And that has some people riled up.

Appearing as a guest on WHJJ-AM’s ""Helen Glover Show,"" Mike Stenhouse, executive director of the Ocean State Policy Research Institute, complained about federal regulations that will mean lights out for the traditional incandescent light bulb.

""They’re basically telling you that the normal light bulbs that we have always used, that Thomas Edison invented, are going to be illegal, I mean, imagine that, they are going to be illegal to use and they have to be replaced,"" he said.

He continued, ""It’s just crazy that the government will make us, MAKE US, force us, make it illegal to use the old bulbs and we have to use these new ones and that is just tyranny.""

A light bulb went off here at PolitiFact and we wondered: Is it true that it will be illegal to use our old bulbs? ""

When we asked Stenhouse to shine some light on his statement, he referred us to a video of a speech on the floor of Congress by U.S. Rep.Ted Poe,  R-Texas. In it, Poe hit on several of the themes that Stenhouse echoed, namely that the government is over-reaching its proper role in setting new efficiency standards for light bulbs.

Conservatives, including Rush Limbaugh and Tea Party leaders, have railed against the law.

It turns out that our colleagues at PolitiFact National looked into similar claims -- by AmeriPAC, a political action committee that largely supports conservative Republican candidates -- that old incandescents would have to be tossed out and replaced with energy efficient ones.

To begin, let’s go back to 1879 when Thomas Edison invented the forerunner of the modern-day  incandescent bulb. Its technology has changed little in the ensuing 132 years. Today, incandescent bulbs are used in an estimated 3 billion of the 4 billion light fixtures  the country.

But in recent years, with rising energy costs and growing concerns about climate change, demand for more energy-efficient lighting has gained momentum. Incandescents are terribly inefficient, with 90 percent of the energy they consume lost through heat.

Responding to those concerns, then-President George W. Bush signed the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which received a measure of bipartisan support in Congress. (It passed in the House 264 to 163, with 36 Republicans voting in favor, and in the Senate, 65 to 27, with 20 Republicans voting in favor.

The act deals with a broad range of energy-consumption issues, including light bulb efficiency. Section 321  spells out the new standards, essentially requiring light bulbs to use 27 percent less energy than traditional incandescents.

The law, while setting efficiency standards for light bulbs, does not ban or favor one type of bulb over another, according to a ""backgrounder"" put out by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. But it will, in effect, end production of traditional incandescent bulbs, beginning with 100-watt bulbs in 2012, then 75-watt bulbs in 2013 and ending with 40-watt bulbs in 2014.

Halogen incandescent bulbs will meet the new standards as will still-pricey LEDs and popular and more affordable compact fluorescent light bulbs, or CFLs. Prices today are $40 to $50 for an LED, $3 for fluorescent alternatives and $1.50 for halogen incandescents, compared with about 50 cents for a typical 100-watt incandescent.

We note, by the way, that Stenhouse echoed concerns about mercury in CFLs, saying, ""If you break them... your home becomes a hazardous area.""

But the EPA calls that a ""myth,"" saying that ""airing out and removing the bulb pieces from the room will quickly dissipate any mercury vapor."" The EPA also labels as myth assertions, repeated by Stenhouse, that CFLs will raise mercury levels in the environment. The agency says coal power plants are the  ""main emitter"" of mercury in the United States, PolitiFact National rated a claim that CFLs are ""toxic"" and  ""not environmentally friendly"" as Half True.

Setting aside these issues about CFLs and, more broadly the merits of the law itself, we return to the question that consumers will want answers to  beginning in 2012: Will the law, as Stenhouse states, ""make it illegal to use the old bulbs.""

While the bill sets standards for new light bulbs ""manufactured or imported"" to the United States, it does not address using old bulbs that don’t meet the new standards.
   
When reached by PolitiFact National, Jen Stutsman, a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy, said people can keep using their old incandescent bulbs and stores can continue to sell them -- even after the new standards are in place -- until they are sold out.
   
""There are no energy police coming to your home to make you remove your light bulbs,"" said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a 30-year-old advocacy organization that advises lawmakers and conducts research.

Stenhouse admitted the possibility that he ""might have made a little mistake there"" in saying that incandescents will be illegal to use -- a statement he made at two separate points of his appearance.

Also, he emphasized that his appearances as a guest of Glover, the former Survivor contestant, are part of  his group’s ""Liberty Bytes"" program. He said the initiative encourages listeners to ask how issues reported in the news ""affect your personal liberties....It’s not our research...it’s all based on media accounts.""

""Obviously, we were convinced that it was accurate,"" he said, but added, ""We did not take the next step of going into the bill and looking up this stuff ourselves.""

We don’t think it would have taken that much research to get a simple and key fact about the bill straight. We found numerous references, including at the Department of Energy website, where  a Q & A states that, ""Consumers will have the choice to continue using traditional incandescent bulbs for as long as they last, or switch to more efficient bulbs.""

Stenhouse needn’t fret personally about which bulbs to use. There’s plenty of light emanating from his trousers",False Pants on Fire,"June 16, 2011"
"Says President Barack Obama ""has put (up) a stop sign … against oil drilling, against any kind of exploration offshore or in Alaska.""","
During Monday’s Republican presidential debate in Manchester, N.H., former Sen. Rick Santorum blasted President Barack Obama’s policies on oil drilling.

Santorum said that Obama ""has put (up) a stop sign … against oil drilling, against any kind of exploration offshore or in Alaska, and that is depressing. We need to drill. We need to create energy jobs.""

We took a look at a similar statement in March, when Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn. -- another GOP presidential contender -- told an audience at a conservative conference that ""the number of new drilling permits under the Obama Administration since they came into office"" is ""one."" We ruled that statement Pants on Fire.

We’ll refer back to our discussion of that claim here, updating it with more current information.

The most recent summary from Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, or BOEMRE -- the federal agency that oversees drilling -- is included in a document titled the ""Status of Well Permits and Plans Subject to Enhanced Safety and Environmental Requirements.""

The report says that 56 shallow-water permits for new wells have been issued since June 8, 2010, when new rules and information requirements were put into effect following the BP oil spill. Shallow-water drilling operations were not affected by the deep-water drilling moratorium following the spill.

In addition, since February of this year -- following the lifting of the moratorium and confirmation of the industry's ability to meet subsea containment requirements -- the government has approved 48 deep-water permits requiring subsea containment, covering 16 unique wells. Another 40 permits not requiring subsea containment have also been approved since October. The operators were required to come back and meet the modified standards.

So there’s been movement on offshore permits in the Gulf of Mexico under Obama. What about drilling elsewhere?

Arctic Ocean exploratory drilling permits continue to wend their way through the permitting process at the Department of Interior, said Richard Charter, a senior policy adviser for the environmental group Defenders of Wildlife.

A chart from BOEMRE confirms that no new offshore wells have been drilled in Alaska since Obama took office. However, only one such well has been drilled in the past dozen years, including eight years when a Republican, George W. Bush was president. So the shortage of drilling in Alaska is not exclusively an Obama-related problem.

Obama did announce in May that he was directing the Interior Department to conduct annual lease sales in Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve. He also ordered a speed-up of seismic surveys of mid- and south-Atlantic coasts and new incentives for industry to develop unused leases both on and offshore.

We should note that while drilling permits haven’t disappeared entirely, the pace of approval has slowed, in large part because Obama has made clear that he wants drilling to be done safely and in an environmentally sensitive fashion.

Lee Hunt, executive director of the International Association of Drilling Contractors, said in March that there has been a ""molasses effect"" with permitting by the Obama Administration. Even shallow-water permits have fallen from their prior level, despite not being directly affected by the post-spill moratorium. Meanwhile, permits for deep-water wells are likely to be a third of what was projected prior to the gulf spill.

Andy Radford, senior policy adviser at the American Petroleum Institute, agreed that permit approvals dropped after the BP spill, but he added in March that the pace of permitting was picking up. ""We'll get to the new normal eventually,"" he said.

All in all, then, Santorum’s claim is incorrect.

""None of this could be accurately even remotely characterized as a ‘stop sign,’"" said Charter of Defenders of Wildlife.

We agree. It’s true that the Obama Administration pulled back the reins after the BP spill. But the administration has continued approving shallow-water wells, and it began to approve deep-water wells again after the moratorium was lifted six months ago. Just because the pace isn’t as fast as some would like doesn’t mean that Obama ""has put (up) a stop sign … against oil drilling, against any kind of exploration offshore or in Alaska."" At most, it would be a yellow light, and Santorum’s claim -- referring to curbs on ""any kind"" of exploration -- is over-broad",False,"June 15, 2011"
"""Every year the state loses 8,000-10,000 acres of land in bear country.""","
The ongoing dispute between the New Jersey Sierra Club and state officials goes beyond whether the state should host another bear hunt this year. It’s also about how they each define ""bear country.""

To the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, ""bear country"" refers to where the December 2010 hunt took place in seven northern New Jersey counties. To New Jersey Sierra Club Director Jeff Tittel, ""bear country"" extends to bear habitats in points further south.

The questions surrounding ""bear country"" stem from the Sierra Club’s recent comments regarding habitat loss. In a press release opposing another hunt this year, the Sierra Club offered a list of ways to manage New Jersey’s bear population, including ""protecting habitat.""

""Every year the state loses 8,000-10,000 acres of land in bear country,"" according to a May 17 press release. ""The more we build houses in the middle of the woods where bears live, the more conflict we will see between bears and humans.""

That estimate of acreage loss caught the attention of PolitiFact New Jersey, especially since New Jersey is the most densely populated state in the country.

Whether the Sierra Club’s numbers are accurate hinges on that original question -- where is ""bear country?""

First, let’s start with how the Sierra Club arrived at its habitat loss figures.

Tittel told us in an email that the Sierra Club’s estimate was based on annual land losses compiled through the the Grant F. Walton Center for Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis at Rutgers University.

In his email, Tittel said the Sierra Club looked at the ""Northern and Western Counties of NJ that have Bears."" By acres lost, Tittel said he was referring to acres developed and fragmented by development, such as the impacts to the edge of a forested area.

But when PolitiFact New Jersey examined the recent research done by the center, the Sierra Club’s numbers didn’t add up -- at least when looking at the seven counties where the 2010 bear hunt occurred.

Between 2002 and 2007, the combined urban growth in those seven counties totaled 4,780 acres per year -- not the 8,000-to-10,000 figure cited by the Sierra Club, according to a July 2010 report from the center director and another professor.

But the total impact on bear habitat goes beyond just the number of acres developed, said Rowan University associate professor John Hasse, who co-authored the July 2010 report. Each acre developed affects wildlife habitat in the surrounding area, Hasse said.

The Sierra Club misfired in terms of growth where the 2010 bear hunt occurred, but Tittel told PolitiFact New Jersey that ""bear country"" -- there’s that phrase again! -- is larger than where the hunt took place.

Tittel argued that sizable bear populations also exist in four other counties not included in the 2010 hunt. When combining the annual growth rates in those counties with the figures from the counties where the 2010 hunt occurred, the new total is 8,806 acres per year, according to the center’s report.

""Bear Country is where there are (breeding) populations and good habitat, not where there is a hunt,"" Tittel wrote in a May 23 email.

But DEP spokesman Larry Ragonese said ""bear country"" should be defined as where last year’s hunt occurred. The bear population has been the most predominant in northwest New Jersey, he said.

Yet DEP records back up Tittel’s point that bears can be found outside of where the hunt was held.

Bears can find suitable habitats in southern parts of New Jersey, and the most recent DEP statistics show bear activity in seven counties not included in the 2010 hunt.

Despite the questions surrounding acreage loss estimates, the Sierra Club correctly states that habitat loss will lead to greater conflicts between bears and humans. Development creates easier access to food for the bruins, increasing their birth rate and survivability, said Larry Katz, a professor of animal sciences at Rutgers University.

""We move into an area and we create more habitat,"" Katz said. ""They’re not frightened off by us.""

Before we give the Sierra Club its rating on the Truth-O-Meter, let’s remember something about all that land being lost to development -- construction activity has taken a sharp downturn in New Jersey and across the country.

According to a report prepared by the New Jersey Department of Labor & Workforce Development, the number of residential building permits authorized in New Jersey decreased by about 50 percent from 25,400 in 2007 to 12,396 in 2009.

Back to the Sierra Club’s statement, let’s review:

The environmental organization said between 8,000 and 10,000 acres annually is lost to development in ""bear country,"" citing the research done by the Grant F. Walton Center for Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis.

But in the counties where the 2010 bear hunt was held, the center’s research pegged growth at 4,780 acres per year. When you throw in figures from other counties mentioned by Tittel, the acreage loss fits within the 8,000-10,000 range in the Sierra Club’s original statement. State records show bear activity in counties outside of last year’s hunting areas.

One professor acknowledged that the loss of bear habitat goes beyond the number of acres developed. The Sierra Club’s underlying point -- habitat loss leads to more bear-human conflicts -- also is in line with the perspective of an animal sciences professor.

Still, the Sierra Club’s argument about the pace of development is undercut by the decline in construction activity statewide",Half True,"June 10, 2011"
"Commerce Secretary nominee John Bryson ""appears to endorse world government.""","Supporting climate change policy is one thing, but is Barack Obama’s nominee for commerce secretary, John Bryson, an advocate for world government?

That's the speculation raised by anonymous GOP sources on Capitol Hill, according to the conservative website the Daily Caller.

Bryson, former chief executive officer and chairman of Southern California energy conglomerate Edison International and co-founder of the Natural Resources Defense Council, has been under fire due to his support for clean-energy legislation. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., called him an ""environmental extremist"" and Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., a global warming skeptic, says he fears Bryson would implement climate change policy that would hurt American businesses. Bryson's nomination is also opposed by Massachusetts Democrats, Reps. Barney Frank and John Tierney, because of the NRDC's fight for fishing-catch limits.

But the claim that Bryson supports a ""world government"" raises the rhetoric to a new level.

The speculation originated in a June 7, 2011, story in the Daily Caller that ran under the headline: ""Commerce nominee appears to endorse world government in video, Republicans say.""

Here's how the story begins:
 
Does John Bryson, Barack Obama’s nominee for commerce secretary, want a world government?

Critics say a newly uncovered video of the nominee suggests that he does.

In the video – given to The Daily Caller by sources on Capitol Hill – Bryson refers to the 2009 United Nations climate negotiations in Copenhagen as ""the closest thing we have to a world governance organization,"" implying it provided the best model for imposing climate regulations on countries around the globe.

Bryson also boasts about his role as an adviser to the U.N. secretary general on climate change in the video.

The story includes a link to a 1-minute and 25-second clip of Bryson making a formal presentation to an unidentified group. Here's the fuller context from the attached video:

""I thought that one of the things that is, in my judgment, not as well covered in the press and not as well understood as it ought to be is the kind of global picture on addressing clean energy and climate change. One of the things that have been a particular pleasure for me over the last year is I’ve been working as an adviser to the Secretary General of the United Nations on that subject. So I thought I would talk a little about that, talk a little about Copenhagen, a little bit about the global environmental and energy picture as I see it. Where we are. Where we might go. I thought I’d start there…So, let’s start with Copenhagen. So Copenhagen, obviously the United Nations is the global entity, the closest thing we have to a world governance organization. Copenhagen negotiations take place under the auspices of the United Nations as does the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), the side of the body that’s developed this growing consensus about the effects of carbon emissions, greenhouse gas emissions on climate change.""

That seems like pretty flimsy evidence on which to base speculation that Bryson ""appears to endorse world government."" So we contacted Daily Caller reporter John Rossomando to find out who provided the video and made the claims. Rossomando wrote back that, ""it came from GOP officials on the Hill, of whom I am not a liberty to name.""

We tracked the origin of the video to a presentation Bryson made at an energy symposium hosted by the University of California Berkeley on March 4, 2010. It's actually about an hour-long speech, with a brief Q & A, which you can watch here.

In the passage in question (at about the 10-minute mark), Bryson was talking about the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference, commonly known as the Copenhagen Summit, and the perception that nothing was accomplished because no treaty was reached.

Bryson made a case that, actually, they did accomplish a good deal. Although it fell short of the binding pact hoped for by many environmental groups, the summit produced a nonbinding emissions deal knows as the Copenhagen Accord.

According to a New York Times account on Dec. 20, 2009, ""The plan does not firmly commit the industrialized nations or the developing nations to firm targets for midterm or long-term greenhouse gas emissions reductions. The accord is nonetheless significant in that it codifies the commitments of individual nations to act on their own to tackle global warming.""

""That means there was no binding legal obligations that came out of what happened in Copenhagen,"" Bryson said in his Berkeley address. ""...But those are nonetheless commitments on behalf of the leaders of those countries.""

""Certainly bringing the nations of the world together around addressing climate change and moving toward consensus and effective agreement on working together is vitally important,"" Bryson said.

Bryson talked about the need to think about climate change on a global basis, but at no point did he advocate for ceding power to the United Nations, let alone advocating anything as extreme as creating a world government.

Brian Darling, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation who was quoted in the Daily Caller story, said it may be a rhetorical stretch to suggest that Bryson was advocating a world government. However, Darling said, what Bryson said on the video is of concern. Bryson seems to suggest that he supports giving the U.N. ""authority to impose climate change policy on other countries."" At the least, he said, Bryson ought to be questioned by Congress about the video and made to explain his position.

Myron Ebell, a climate-change skeptic at the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute, said the portion of the clip posted by the Daily Caller ""implies that (Bryson) supports global governing institutions. That is, he supports Kyoto and successor agreements to require mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. These international agreements are administered by an institution, the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), that is administered by the UN, which Bryson says is 'the closest thing we have to a world governance organization.'  Supporting the Kyoto Protocol thus seems to imply that he supports some sort of world governance organization. But not quite necessarily.""

However, Ebell said, ""supporting some global institutions that govern some aspects of life is not the same as supporting world government."" To suggest the clip is evidence that Bryson supports a world government is a ""stretch,"" he said. ""I wouldn’t be surprised to learn that he does, but more evidence is required to establish what he really believes or supports.  I think that what we do know about Mr. Bryson already is sufficient to disqualify him to be Secretary of Commerce from our perspective, which is why we oppose his confirmation.""

We contacted the White House press office to see where Bryson stands on the whole ""world government"" issue, but they declined to comment, saying the fuller context of Bryson's statement -- even in the short clip on the Daily Caller site -- is enough to definitively refute the claim.

We agree. Referring to the United Nations as ""the closest thing we have to a world governance organization"" isn't exactly a smoking gun. We didn't hear any evidence in Bryson's full, hour-long address that suggests he wants to cede the U.S. government's authority over climate change policy to the United Nations, let alone something as radical and all-encompassing as a world government.

"Michigan and Massachusetts raised their bottle deposit and ""could no longer afford the program because the redemptions were so high there was no profit in there.""","
The Oregon Senate recently gave final approval to a bill that widely expands Oregon’s iconic bottle bill. Among other things, the legislation increases the sorts of beverages covered and leaves room for a possible increase from the current nickel deposit to a dime.

It’s that last bit, the five to ten cents bit, that drew the strongEST rebuke from dissenting senators. The increase happens only if the return rate in Oregon dips below 80 percent two years in a row. Distributors don’t think that will happen. In fact, they’re so sure they can keep rates high that they endorsed the bill.

But some Republican senators didn’t see how that made any sense. If proponents were so certain redemption rates wouldn’t fall, why bother including that provision in the bill at all?

Sen. Jeff Kruse was among those who spoke against that piece of the expansion.

""We have some unintended consequences that may come in with this increase to a dime … I would point to a couple states -- Michigan and Massachusetts -- that increased their redemption value and what happened in both of those states is they could no longer afford the program because the redemptions were so high there was no profit in there,"" he told his colleagues.

His reasoning as far as we could tell -- and he later confirmed -- was that those states had such high redemption rates, the deposit money mostly got refunded and that left the states no money to run their programs.

That’s a pretty dire prognosis: The program could work so well that it would eliminate its own funding stream.

PolitiFact Oregon decided to check it out. First up was Michigan. We talked to Terry Stanton, the spokesman for the state’s Department of Treasury.

Michigan’s deposit, he said, was indeed 10 cents -- the highest in the nation -- and the return rate was nearly 97 percent. (For comparison, Oregon is just under 80 percent.)

Does the high redemption cause problems? Is the Michigan system going broke?

At first, Stanton didn’t seem to understand what we were asking. The idea that the bottle redemption program was a way to raise funds and not to encourage recycling just didn’t seem right.

""I don't know,"" he said. ""That wasn't the purpose of the program … This was initiated really to clean up the road waste.""

Right, we said. Same with Oregon. But here, the unclaimed deposits help run the system. If there aren’t any, the system might face problems. We asked again: Is that happening in Michigan.

He checked and sent us this e-mail:

""First, as noted on the phone, Michigan's bottle deposit law was put in place in the 1970's, to help cleanup roadsides, etc., that were becoming cluttered with bottles and cans.  The deposit has been at 10 cents since inception.  Michigan's program, which was approved by a vote of the people, was not designed to be a revenue generator but to keep roadsides and the environment clean. ...

""As for the unredeemed cans, the Michigan Bottle Deposit Law states that of the unclaimed deposits that revert to the state, 75 percent is deposited into the Cleanup and Redevelopment Trust Fund and 25 percent is returned to the retailers. ...  

""I'm not sure what the individual in Oregon is claiming as far as ‘not having the money to operate.’  As far as I'm aware, Michigan's program is not experiencing problems.""

Well, that didn’t seem to match very well with what Kruse had said. So, we gave him a call and asked where he’d heard that Michigan was going broke.

""I don't have documentation,"" Kruse said, adding it came from ""a discussion we were having.""

""The logic behind it is that the program pays for itself by those (deposits) that aren't returned. So, if you get to the point where you're getting 100 percent"" there’s no fuel for the program, Kruse said. ""I guess i was trying to make the point that this move, if we got back to the dime, could come back to bite us in a way that we did not anticipate.""

Then, he added that the deposit might be even higher in Massachusetts -- even a quarter. Maybe there were issues there.

We did some Googling (we’re hi-tech here) and couldn’t find anything about a quarter deposit there. We did find a few articles about an expansion included in the Massachusetts governor’s proposal, but that dealt only with the types of containers included. There wasn’t a word about an increase from a nickel to a quarter.

But we like to be complete in our fact-checking, so we gave the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection a call. We talked to Edmund Coletta, the spokesman for the department, about the latest on the state’s deposit system.

The bottle deposit, he confirmed, was still a nickel. The governor recently pushed to get more beverage containers included under the program, he said, but neither the state’s House nor Senate included the changes in their budget proposals.

What’s more, he added, increasing the current nickel deposit is ""definitely not in the governor’s proposal.""

For a final word on all this, we decided to give John Anderson a call. He’s the president of the Oregon Beverage Recycling Cooperative, the group that’s helping to expand redemption centers through the state. We asked him whether Kruse might be on to something. Could an increased deposit lead to a collapse in Oregon’s system?

While it’s true, he said, that unredeemed deposits ""are the major funding for the system"" it’s unlikely that, even with a dime, we’d hit Michigan’s 97 percent return rate.

Part of that has to do with the fact that Michigan is surrounded by major out-of-state population centers. That ""Seinfeld"" episode about Kramer taking empties from New York to Michigan for the double deposit? That actually happens.

But Oregon only has Vancouver nearby. So even at 10 cents, ""we end up about in the high 80s, that's my estimate,"" Anderson said. ""I think we lose on redeemed deposits, but I don't think we go into a crisis mode.

""I don't think that's a problem that we really need to spend a lot of time on.""

This case seems pretty open and shut to us. Kruse tried to persuade his Senate colleagues that too-high deposits in Michigan and Massachusetts were crippling those programs. But Michigan says that’s not the case and Massachusetts doesn’t even have a higher deposit rate. Kruse doesn’t have any evidence to back up his claim. The statement is not just false -- it’s ridiculous",False Pants on Fire,"June 6, 2011"
Increasing the bottle deposit to 10 cents on a case of water bottles could literally double the price of that product in the store.,"
Last week the Oregon House approved an expansion of the state’s bottle bill law, adding single-serve coffees, energy drinks, teas, and sports drinks to the list of beverages that now require a nickel return deposit. Furthermore, House Bill 3145 calls for that nickel to increase to 10 cents if the redemption rate falls below 80 percent for two years in a row.

Rep. Matt Wingard, R-Wilsonville, was among a dozen legislators in the House to vote against the bill. He thinks it’s a great idea, really, but he doesn’t like the possibility of a dime per drink.

""I’m hung up on the fee increase,"" he said in his floor speech, later adding, ""The deposit going from 5 to 10 cents, for instance on a case of water bottles, could literally double the price of that product in the store.""

Now, bottled water is cheap. And the bottle bill deposit is per container, not per size of said container -- so, the more containers, the more deposits (refundable, of course.)

But could a nickel increase really double the price of a set of water bottles?

A quick check at a downtown Portland Safeway showed these prices for a case (24) of half-liter water bottles:
  
- Aquafina, $4.99 each, or $3.99 each if you buy two cases. 
- Arrowhead spring water, $3.79 each at Safeway Club price. 
- Refreshe, $3.34 each on sale (Safeway Select brand). 

Wingard had similar examples, as well as a bargain price of $2.99 for a case of Crystal Geyser at an Albertsons. Tack on $2.40 and that is indeed nearly a doubling of the original price of $2.99.

But context is critical and we want to provide some of that.

One, Wingard has highlighted just about the worst-case scenario when it comes to the bottle bill deposit. Small bottles of plain water --added under the bottle bill in 2007 -- are cheap. Most deposit-worthy drinks do not cost mere pennies, they’re more like 89 cents apiece or $1.59 each or $6.99 for a six-pack.

Two, we know Wingard and others are convinced the bottle deposit will creep up to a dime -- but that’s not a done deal. Under the current bill, the deposit would stay at 5 cents unless the redemption rates falls below 80 percent for two consecutive years; the earliest measurable years are 2014 and 2015, with the soonest a dime could be levied Jan. 1, 2017. (The new canned or bottled drinks in this legislation, such as coffee, tea, energy drinks, etc. are not counted as part of redemption rates until January 2021.)

The redemption rate rate for 2009 was 75 percent, according to the Oregon Beverage Recycling Cooperative and it’s expected to be several percentage points lower for 2010. Still, that doesn’t mean a 10-cent deposit is right around the corner.

Three, Wingard doesn’t point out that the current deposit on a case of water is already high, compared with its base cost. At $1.20, that $2.99 case of water rings up at $4.19 under the current bottle bill law.

And four, water bottle lovers can get their $1.20 or $2.40 back, just by returning the containers. It’s not a fee that you forfeit forever. And if you don’t redeem your bottles and cans, know that the beer and wine distributors will get to keep the cash.  

Wingard, in response, said he focused his statement on bottled water.

Yes, taken narrowly, the cost of a case of water could nearly double. But Wingard does a lot of heavy lifting to get to his statement and ignores two particularly crucial points: The fact that there’s already a five cent deposit on these items -- meaning, really, the percent increase of what buyers are shelling out is much smaller than 100 percent -- and also the fact that this is money that is refundable -- you get it back as soon as you return the bottles. So the ""cost"" could be zero",True,"May 13, 2011"
"Benzene has ""never been proven to be harmful.""","
During House debate, state Rep. Rick Hardcastle brushed off a colleague’s concerns about benzene emissions near Texas schools.  ""Are you aware benzene is also a compound in soap?"" Hardcastle said April 28. ""Found at every car wash in this state — and several other industries in this state? And it’s never been proven to be harmful.""

The Vernon Republican was opposing an amendment by Rep. Lon Burnam, D-Fort Worth, that would prohibit the Oil and Gas Commission from issuing drilling permits for gas wells within 1,200 feet from a public school unless they meet a set of conditions, including installing emission controls and ensuring certain pollutants, such as benzene, fall below certain concentrations.

Members tabled Burnam’s proposal. Still, we wondered if benzene has really never been proven harmful?

First, a benzene primer: According to the federal Environmental Protection Agency, benzene is an organic chemical compound found most often in the air as a result of emissions from burning coal and oil, drilling for natural gas or in gasoline vapors, car exhaust, cigarette smoke and other sources. The chemical also is used as a solvent for inks, paint and plastics and to manufacture detergents.

EPA spokesman Joe Hubbard told us benzene is a ""widely used chemical formed from both natural processes and human activities."" Still, in 1986, the agency classified benzene as a ""human carcinogen and hazardous air pollutant,"" he said.

When we reached Hardcastle, he agreed that benzene is ""a proven carcinogen"" but said that’s only so when a person is ""overly-exposed to it"" for a long period of time. Otherwise, he said, it hasn’t been proven harmful.

""It’s a carcinogen, but everything’s a carcinogen,"" he said. ""You eat too much white bread and it’s a carcinogen.""

Texas Commission on Environmental Quality spokesman Terry Clawson told us that benzene is harmful depending on its concentration in air and how long someone is exposed to it. ""Typical outdoor concentrations"" of benzene, less than one part per billion, are ""much lower than concentrations that have been shown to cause harmful effects in people,"" he said. But exposure to higher concentrations, tens of thousands of parts per billion, over a period of many months to years ""has been shown to cause harmful effects on blood,"" he said. Longer exposures, over many years, have ""been shown to cause leukemia in workers,"" he said.

A fact sheet issued by the agency in October 2007 says as much: ""Permitted levels of benzene should not cause adverse health and welfare effects,"" but breathing high levels of the chemical compound can damage blood cells, human studies indicate. ""Some occupational workers, who have been exposed to some of the highest air concentrations of benzene for years, experienced a decrease in the number of white blood cells circulating in their blood.""

According to the EPA’s web page on hazards associated with benzene, chronic exposure for a year or more has caused blood disorders, including reduced numbers of red blood cells and aplastic anemia — a risk factor for developing acute non-lymphocytic leukemia. The EPA site says short-term exposure to benzene may cause drowsiness, dizziness, headaches, eye, skin and respiratory tract irritation, and, at high levels, unconsciousness.

And a February 2009 study funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences found that leukemia risks could be greater at ambient levels of benzene exposure — that is, benzene in the air where people live, rather than where they work —  than previously thought.

A 2009 EPA summary says that some studies, such as those gauging links between childhood exposure to benzene and childhood cancer, are equivocal. A 2001 study found a connection between Hodgkins lymphoma and young children who lived in high-traffic ares with higher concentrations of benzene during pregnancy or early childhood, while a 2002 study found no connection between childhood cancer rates and benzene concentrations in high-traffic neighborhoods.

Closer to home, a 2010 study by researchers at the University of Texas and the Texas Department of State Health Services found that women living in Texas neighborhoods with high levels of benzene (more than 3 micrograms per cubic meter of air) were more likely to bear children with spinal bifida — a serious birth defect that can cause paralysis and neurological disorders.

According to an August 2007 benzene fact sheet published by the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, ""some women who breathed high levels of benzene for many months had irregular menstrual periods and a decrease in the size of their ovaries."" But, according to the fact sheet, ""we do not know for certain that benzene caused these effects.""

Recent studies have found that environmental exposure to benzene increases the risk of childhood cancer, birth defects and lowers birth weight, he said. ""Cancer is not the only concern. ""While it’s true that the only ‘proven’ effects are in occupationally exposed workers, studies strongly suggest that adverse effects on children and pregnant women are probably at lower environmental levels.

Finally, Martyn Smith, a toxicology professor at the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley, who has studied the health effects of benzene, told us that Hardcastle is ""wrong.""

There is no known threshold for when benzene becomes carcinogenic, Smith said. According to a study Smith authored that was published in the Annual Review of Public Health in April 2010, ""there is probably no safe level of exposure of benzene, and all exposures constitute some risk.""

Where does that leave us?

It’s true that benzene is a common air pollutant and is found in everyday products such as detergents. But to claim that airborne benzene has not been proven harmful flies in the face of scientific evidence that long-term exposure in the workplace can cause cancer and other negative health effects — not to mention studies suggesting lower levels of environmental exposure may also be unsafe",False Pants on Fire,"May 7, 2011"
"Says Florida is one of a few or perhaps the only state ""that has a statewide review of local land use and zoning decisions.""","Here's a secret about floor sessions of the Florida House of Representatives -- they can get pretty repetitive. Most legislators ask questions about bills that they already know the answers to, and are simply asking the questions to make political points. Most amendments offered by Democrats in the GOP-dominated body fail. And most always, a bill's fate is known well ahead of time.

But for hours, members go through a ritualistic sparring that -- to the first-time viewer -- can look unscripted.

We start with that description, because we fact-checkers must admit to sometimes being guilty of tuning it all out.

That is, until, our name is being called.

The situation occurred on April 21, 2011, during a debate about a bill that would ease the amount of oversight the state Department of Community Affairs has over local land use issues. HB 7129 was going to pass, after all. The debate was academic.

But Rep. Chris Dorworth, R-Lake Mary, shook us awake with his floor remarks advocating on behalf of the bill.

""This is ripe for a PolitiFact, but I've asked in almost every committee we've seen this bill -- I don't believe any other state in the union has a system like we do,"" he said. ""I think we might be the only (state) in the United States of America that has a statewide review of local land use and zoning decisions. And that means we are 50th, or 49th at worst, in terms of the fact that we have to get our local decisions approved through the state.""

First off, thanks, Rep. Dorworth, for the plug.

The issue here is the state Department of Community Affairs' ability to review local comprehensive plans and amendments, and more specifically, to determine whether or not they are in compliance with state growth management laws. If the DCA finds a local comprehensive plan not in compliance, a judge is asked to settle the discrepancy.

Dorworth and others want to relax that oversight, believing it can be unnecessary and burdensome. As Dorworth suggested, he also believes it's a one-of-a-kind standard in the United States. HB 7129 prescribes a more-streamlined process that attempts to cut the DCA review period in half, and strip some of the power the state agency now has to object to local land use decisions.

We let Dorworth know that we were taking his challenge to fact-check his claim, and he said he has asked 10 different times if another state has Florida's system of review. ""No one seemed to know,"" he told us. ""People said Oregon has something like ours, but then they said that it's not the same.""

Understanding Florida's system

Without getting too technical, we're not talking about a state review of every land use decision a local government makes (Dorworth oversimplified things in his original statement, which we will factor in when making our ruling). We're talking about comprehensive plans, which offer rough guidance on how a community can develop over time. The plan and corresponding maps let you know where the agricultural land in an area is -- and what someone can possibly build there -- and where a city defines its urban core and what can go along with that.

As municipalities grow, they sometimes want or are asked to redraw their plans to accommodate more dense development. A common example would be wanting to designate agricultural or rural land for a more intense use. Florida has a very prescribed process for that, which includes time for the state to review the amendment and public hearings at the local level. (Here's a flow chart to help you follow.)

If the local government approves the amendment, DCA then decides whether it is in compliance with state law. If the DCA deems the amendment is not in compliance, the local government is often asked to alter its plan, or to take the matter to court. In a contentious case, it's a judge who ultimately decides whether or not the amendment is permitted.

The system in other states

Rather than checking the 49 other states individually to see whether Dorworth is correct, we got a road map of places to examine from Stuart Meck, an associate research professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey who has written about state planning. He said several states, including Florida, had some level of state review of local land use decisions -- though the level of oversight varied. At each stop, we asked state planners or planning experts what other states might include stringent reviews of some local planning decisions.

Most all states have some sort of appellate review of planning decisions, whether it's through the state government or through the courts, or both. But as we searched over the course of a week, we built a final list of suspects that most mirror Florida. They are the states of Oregon, Washington, Hawaii, Vermont and Rhode Island.

In the Northeast, Vermont and Rhode Island have similar laws that give the state oversight over land use decisions, but only if local governments want to participate in state development grant programs. It's a carrot approach, said Jared Rhodes, the chief of Rhode Island's Division of Planning.

In Rhode Island, a state review of local comprehensive plan amendments is essentially required, Rhodes said. But if the state does not approve of the amendment, it is still considered valid. ""A state denial does not necessarily put the brakes on it,"" he said.

In Vermont, municipalities have the option of submitting plans and plan amendments to state-created regional planning commissions. Local governments that receive approvals from the regional planning commissions can then be eligible for state grant funding, said Joss Besse, the director of community planning with the Vermont Department of Housing and Community Affairs.

In Washington, local governments are required to send prospective land use changes to the state's Department of Commerce for review. But the state provides only technical assistance and does not override local decisions. ""State agency written correspondence will not state that local plans are out of compliance with the (growth management act),"" the state says on its website. ""State agencies may express concerns, but conclusory statements as to compliance will be avoided."" Oregon's rules -- which were created in 1973 -- are more stringent, and built the framework for Florida's law, former DCA secretary Tom Pelham told us.

All Oregon cities and counties are required to have a comprehensive plan, and those plans must be approved by a seven-member state board. That was finished by 1985, said Bob Rindy, senior policy analyst and legislative coordinator with the Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development. But when plans are amended, Rindy said, typically there is not much oversight.

Local plan amendments are considered finalized 21 days after they are adopted by the local government unless someone appeals. Appeals, which can be initiated by the state or other affected parties, are first heard by a state Land Use Board of Appeals and then could enter the state court system.

The rules are different, though, when local jurisdictions seek to expand their urban growth boundaries. Those expansions need the approval of the state, Rindy said. ""When cities try and move out into farmland to grow larger, then the state has oversight over the decision how much they expand that boundary by,"" he said. ""That's one of the things that puts us in the limelight.""

And then there is Hawaii, which by our estimation has the most state-level oversight of planning decisions -- even more so than in Florida.

The state of Hawaii's Land Use Commission holds sweeping power over granting development rights outside the urban centers of the island chain, said David L. Callies, Kudo Professor of Law at the University of Hawaii, who was written a book about Hawaii's system for land use planning.

The commission, appointed by the governor, decides whether land should be classified Agriculture, Conservation, Urban or Rural. Only in the Urban district, which makes up less than 4 percent of land in the state, do local land use controls like zoning apply without shared authority by the Land Use Commission, Callies said. If property owners wish to reclassify their land in order to develop it, they must receive the permission of the Land Use Commission.

Callies said the commission generally accepts large-lot development projects in the Agriculture district. But, if ""your land is in Conservation, you almost have no chance."" Callies says the system is the most regulated in the country, and that going from raw land to completed development could take 10 years.

Our ruling

This is a tough claim to rule on for a couple of reasons. First, Dorworth oversimplified things when he said Florida reviews local land use decisions. The state review is of changes to comprehensive plans. Second, Dorworth said only that he might be right that Florida is the only state in the country with a state review procedure.

Our analysis shows that Florida has a unique form of state review, but it's not the only state to have some oversight.

Some are certainly less stringent. Vermont and Rhode Island offer incentives to provide oversight, while Washington offers just technical assistance to local governments.

Oregon is similar in that major changes -- in its case, an expansion of the urban service boundary -- require state approval.

And Hawaii has a system with a great amount of state oversight.

Here's what Dorworth said: ""This is ripe for a PolitiFact, but I've asked in almost every committee we've seen this bill -- I don't believe any other state in the union has a system like we do. I think we might be the only (state) in the United States of America that has a statewide review of local land use and zoning decisions. And that means we are 50th, or 49th at worst, in terms of the fact that we have to get our local decisions approved through the state.""

If you look at each sentence, Dorworth's first sentence is largely true, his second sentence is really not (except for adding might), and his third sentence is somewhere in between.

The best way to explain this, perhaps, is to say that many states have procedures to review some local planning decisions, but Florida has more regulatory authority than most states",Half True,"April 29, 2011"
"""A $250 fine if you're caught with a plastic bag coming out of a store. Plastic bag police anyone?""","
On Monday, talk-radio host and conservative Victoria Taft sent two tweets regarding a proposed plastic bag ban pending in Salem. The first: ""$250 fine for possession of plastic bag if ban goes thru."" The second: ""‘Plastic’ Bag Ban: A $250 fine if you're caught with a plastic bag coming out of a store. Plastic bag police anyone?#5vtshow.""
PolitiFact Oregon knows that under proposed legislation there would be a 5-cent charge for each paper bag. But a $250 fine for mere possession of a bag? A plastic bag police? Those were intriguing concepts.

Taft has received one Pants on Fire and one False from PolitiFact Oregon, so we understand her reluctance to talk to us about her tweets. (Her email response to our query asked more questions than it answered.) That said, we did some checking and found that the $250 fine is rooted in reality: It’s the penalty levied on a retailer -- not a shopper -- for continuing to hand out single-use plastic bags at checkout.

Palmer Mason, a legislative analyst with the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, said if the ban becomes law, the agency likely would use the first year not to fine, but to educate retailers on a new bag ban.

""This is a huge behavioral change.This affects most of the retail transactions in the state of Oregon and it will take time for consumers and retailers and for the industry to change their behavior and change what they’ve been doing for many years,"" he said.

(That said, Mason wants retailers to know that DEQ isn’t afraid to ticket flagrant flouters in year one.)

To be absolutely fair to Taft, the original language of Senate Bill 536 states that DEQ ""may impose a civil penalty on a person"" who violates Section 2 -- but again, Section 2 applies to retailers and what the establishments may or may not provide in terms of checkout bags. And, an amendment dated March 3, way before she tweeted, clarifies the original bill to strike out the words ""a person"" and replace the term with ""a retail establishment.""

Taft is right when she says there is a $250 fine for plastic bag abuse. But her second tweet, which  reads in part -- ""a $250 fine if you're caught with a plastic bag coming out of a store"" -- gives the impression that the individual shopper would be fined for possessing a plastic bag. And that’s just not true",False Pants on Fire,"April 29, 2011"
"""For every [coyote] they kill, the population will replace and usually multiply.""","
Coyotes have people howling mad on Aquidneck Island.

Middletown residents recently packed a meeting to tell town officials how alarmed they are by  coyotes boldly stalking neighborhoods, leaping fences into backyards and snatching beloved pets. Action is needed, they demanded, before one of the notoriously sly predators maims or kills a small child.

But the solution that the residents convinced the town to approve April 4 -- enlisting the services of a hunter to kill coyotes -- has infuriated others. Several hundred residents have signed a petition opposing the plan.

""The Town of Middletown has hired a hunter to begin a systematic mass killing of the coyotes,"" the petition reads. ""What they do not take into consideration is that for every one they kill, the population will replace and usually multiply the numbers,"" reads the petition.

That second part sounded so counter-intuitive -- after all, didn’t we hunt buffalo and wolves to near extinction? -- that we decided to look into it.

But first we have to dispense with the statement about the ""mass killing"" of coyotes in Middletown. 
As far as we know, no one has suggested that the goal is to kill huge numbers of coyotes. At the April 4 meeting, Police Chief Anthony Pesare said the town would hire just one hunter to target coyotes that have lost their fear of humans. The hunter, he said, would be teamed up with Numi Mitchell,  who since 2005 has been running the Narragansett Bay Coyote Study.

Had we run this statement through the Truth-O-Meter, it  would have rated a False ruling. But we were more interested in the petition’s claim that killing coyotes just leads the animals to ""replace and usually multiply the numbers.""

First we called Shana Gaines, a Newport woman and vintage clothing store owner, who started the petition. She said she based the text on remarks by Mitchell, whose team has been placing radio collars on coyotes and tracking them to better understand their habits.

Mitchell, after confirming her advisory role in the Middletown initiative, referred us to several research studies, including those by Frederick F. Knowlton, who spent 45 years studying coyotes and other wildlife with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Wildlife Service and as a professor at Utah State University. His work, much of it relating to coyote attacks on livestock, is commonly cited in scientific papers.

""Local population reduction can provide temporary relief to sheep operators, but only until the local coyote population compensates for the removals and fills vacant territories. … Population reduction as a management option usually requires annual reapplications due to the reproductive capabilities and ease of movement of coyotes,"" he and his co-authors wrote in one 1999 paper.

Kim Murray Berger, another researcher who has studied coyotes, wolves and other predators, wrote in a 2006 paper that although systematic campaigns to kill predators have ""threatened"" such species as wolves, coyotes ""have shown remarkable resilience.""

The scientific explanation that is commonly given is intriguing.

""It’s called responsive reproduction,"" said Christine Schadler, a wild-canid ecologist and teacher who is the New England representative for the advocacy group Project Coyote. ""It seems very mysterious. How can you shoot and shoot and shoot and wind up with more? It doesn’t seem intuitive at all.""

But here’s what happens, she said. Coyotes typically live in a pack that stakes out, and protects, a territory. Packs are led by an alpha male and female, which are the only breeders among the group. When stressed by a limited amount of food, the females produce litters with fewer pups.

But when the size of a pack is reduced, there’s more food for each individual. And breeding becomes more prolific. Their numbers bounce back in a year or two, she said.

Coyotes have expanded from western parts of the country, despite attempts to reduce their numbers there, and spread to the East, taking advantage of the decline in wolf populations, a natural territorial competitor.

""In a hundred years of trying to control the coyotes, all we’ve done is create millions more,"" Schadler said. ""There’s not a scientific article that can dispute that.""

A New Hampshire sheep raiser, Schadler ""educates"" the local coyote pack to feel threatened by humans -- in ways that are not harmful to the animals. That, along with good fences and other deterrents, has prevented her from losing any sheep. All experts on coyotes caution against intentionally or unintentionally providing coyotes a source of food.

We searched for someone who might argue that killing coyotes can reduce populations.

We called Wildlife Services, a federal agency within the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The office readily acknowledges overseeing the killing of tens of thousands of coyotes every year, much to the chagrin of wildlife advocates.

But even Carol Bannerman, a spokeswoman for the agency, would not advocate killing coyotes simply to reduce populations. The agency responds to complaints of damage being caused by coyotes, such as livestock losses, with an ""integrated management plan"" that emphasizes non-lethal methods to ward off coyotes.

Where does that leave us?

Bannerman, Middletown officials and Mitchell all appear to embrace the idea, to some degree, that the targeted killing of coyotes too comfortable around humans can help deal with isolated problems.

""This is just a short-term solution for a couple of individual coyotes,"" Mitchell said.

Knowlton, the Utah expert, said local reduction programs can provide temporary relief from coyote problems.

But, in general, wildlife advocates and scientific studies maintain that coyotes are such prolific breeders that trying to lower their numbers by killing them is ineffective.

So it appears the petition, apart from the ""mass killing"" falsehood,  wasn’t feeding us a pack of lies after all",Mostly True,"April 15, 2011"
"A cap-and-trade bill would ""destroy over 50,000 jobs in Virginia.""","
U.S. Rep. Robert Hurt, R-Va., took time out from the budget showdown March 25 to express his contempt for cap-and-trade legislation aimed at regulating and lowering greenhouse emissions.

In a newsletter to his 5th District constituents, Hurt detailed his efforts to cut the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget. The freshman congressman wrote he is ""a co-sponsor of H.R. 153, which would prohibit any funds at the EPA from being used to implement a cap-and-trade system that would harm our agriculture and manufacturing sectors, destroy over 50,000 jobs in Virginia, and amount to a job-crushing national energy tax when we can least afford it.""

A cap-and-trade bill known as Waxman-Markey passed the House during the prior Congress, only to die in the Senate. With the GOP now holding a majority in the House, the bill is generally considered dead. But Hurt’s claim that the legislation would cause more than 50,000 people to lose their jobs caught our eye.

First, a word on how cap-and-trade would work. Each company with major greenhouse gas emissions would be subject to a cap on its emissions. Companies producing fewer emissions than their limit could trade or sell their extra emissions credits to companies exceeding the cap.

The trading system would create a market for greenhouse gas emissions and give companies incentives to lower their emissions levels, since a cut in emissions could be turned into profits from the sale of extra credits. Each credit would cover one metric ton of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas and carry a price between $48 and $61 around 2020.

The Waxman-Markey bill would have gradually lowered emission limits for companies. By 2020, U.S. emissions would be capped 17 percent below 2005 levels. In 2030, the level would be 42 percent below 2005 levels and 83 percent lower by 2050.

Hurt drew his job-loss estimate from the National Association of Manufacturers, a business group opposed to the bill. NAM estimated that by 2030 Virginia could lose between 41,400 and 56,400 jobs because of the legislation, including lost mining jobs and positions lost if higher electricity prices cut back on manufacturing output. Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli has also cited the report in making almost identical claims as Hurt.

NAM’s analysis projects Virginia would see higher energy prices under the bill, since the state’s electric utilities rely heavily on coal-fired power plants. The plants produce high levels of greenhouse gasses and might need to be retooled or replaced with non-emitting power sources -- such as nuclear plants or wind turbines -- to help Dominion Virginia Power or other utilities comply with the proposed law.

If the utility companies continued to use coal plants, they might need to purchase extra carbon permits, again leading to an additional cost that could raise prices. These higher electricity prices, in turn, could force job cuts in the coal mining and manufacturing sectors, the report says.  

But independent experts and the federal Energy Information Agency say it is extremely difficult to calculate the bill’s long-term impact on employment. An EIA report notes the difficulty of predicting the price and availability of renewable energy sources in 2030. If cheaper wind and solar power became available, higher electricity prices may not be a major issue under the bill.

Jeffrey Frankel, an economist at Harvard University, said it is ""not unreasonable to expect job losses in several sectors ... especially coal, unless we come up with some genuine clean coal technology.""

But Frankel said the NAM report cannot really make an accurate jobs forecast for 2030 when economists often struggle to make employment predictions more than 6 or 12 months in advance. The economist also said the NAM analysis ignores the jobs that would be created due to a growth in new, non-emission technologies.

""My feeling, as I think most economists would agree, is that the jobs created would approximately equal the jobs lost,"" he said.

Charles Kolstad, a professor of environmental economics at the University of California, Santa Barbara, added that ""long range forecasts of unemployment are highly suspect. Sectors change, people change jobs. Unemployment is by its nature transitory.""

The Congressional Budget Office, the independent research and analysis arm of Congress, notes in a report that cap-and-trade could shift demand away from fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas. The CBO said jobs in coal mining and at coal-fired power plants could decrease  unless new technology is able to capture emissions.

But the CBO also expects employment to increase in sectors that require fewer emissions, such as nuclear, solar and wind power. Its report says the Waxman-Markey system, where carbon caps tighten over several decades, ""would probably have only a small effect on total employment.""

As the CBO and Kolstad noted, the U.S. economy is adept at retooling to meet new challenges. Manufacturing employment fell by about 3.5 million jobs from 2000 through 2007, but employment in other sectors increased by 8.2 million jobs in that period, continuing the 40-year shift in America’s economy from manufacturing jobs to service jobs. Though workers who lose coal mining or other fossil fuel-related jobs may need retraining before finding a new position, the CBO predicts that ""most laid-off workers would find employment in other industries whose products are less emission-intensive.""

One potential problem, however, is the risk that job losses would be concentrated in small communities, such as those scattered across Virginia’s coal belt, where other job opportunities are limited. This could force workers to relocate to find new work. The National Mining Association reports Virginia had about 4,650 coal miners in 2009, compared with 21,665 in West Virginia and more than 18,000 in Kentucky.

The Virginia Employment Commission reported the state had an average of 8,748 coal-mining and natural-gas jobs in the third quarter of 2010, the most recent period for which data are available. The VEC also says Virginia had about 230,700 manufacturing jobs as of February, and the NAM believes some of those could be threatened by higher energy prices.

The mining jobs are concentrated in the Southwest Virginia district represented by Republican H. Morgan Griffith. Hurt’s district contains manufacturing jobs as well as three power plants, according to EIA records.

Let’s review our findings.

Hurt, citing solely from a short report by the National Association of Manufacturers, says a cap-and-trade bill would cost Virginia 50,000 jobs. The NAM is an opponent of the legislation.

The non-partisan CBO acknowledges there would likely be job losses in certain mining and manufacturing sectors under a cap-and-trade bill. But unlike the NAM, the CBO accounts for jobs that would be gained in new sectors.

Independent analysts also predict cap-and-trade would have a far smaller impact on Virginia employment than projected by NAM. They also note long-range employment projections can be dicey.

A thorough economic analysis should consider both gains and losses from a policy. The NAM report fails to do that.

Hurt’s statement, based on the study, omits critical facts",True,"April 12, 2011"
"""In three years we could find close to 50 million gallons per day through a toilet replacement program.""","
Despite decades of legal squabbles over the Southeast’s precious water resources, the problem still looms large over Georgia.

But take heart. And look down. Some of the solutions can be found in your toilet, the head of a water conservation group said recently.  

""In three years we could find close to 50 million gallons per day through a toilet replacement program,"" Sally Bethea, founding director of Upper Chattahoochee Riverkeeper, said in a recent article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Can better commodes really flush away that much of the area’s water problem?

Georgia has been battling for years with Florida and Alabama over how to divvy up the region’s water supply. In 2009, a federal judge ruled that if the states fail to reach a water-sharing agreement by mid-July 2012, metro Atlanta can take only the same amount of water it received in the mid-1970s -- when the population was less than a third of what it is today.

 Georgia appealed the ruling in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, and the state has a good shot at victory.

Even if Georgia wins this battle, the available water supply might not meet the region’s long-term needs.

So Bethea has targeted the potty, the modern household’s thirstiest water hog. Nationally and locally, governments have created programs to replace old-fashioned commodes that can use more than 3.5 gallons per flush with low-flow toilets that use as little as 1.28 gallons.  

This is how Riverkeeper came up with its number:

Atlanta is part of the 15-county Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District, which includes counties as far north as Hall and as far south as Coweta. She said the planning district estimates that 850,000 homes have old-fashioned plumbing.

The district already has programs in which residents receive rebates if they install low-flow toilets. But Bethea said she envisions a more dramatic change.

In the mid-1990s, New York City ran a successful program that changed out the city’s old toilets with low-flow ones.

Over three years, that effort switched about 1.3 million toilets and saved an estimated 70 million to 80 million gallons per day, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Under the privately managed program, which was heavily promoted to apartment building owners and plumbers, property owners received up to $240 per toilet to have them replaced by a licensed professional.  

Experts we interviewed think that New York City-style programs can be more effective than a typical rebate program. They are especially helpful for properties with low- or fixed-income residents who often live in older housing with outdated plumbing.

Using EPA figures, Riverkeeper calculated that 8,120 gallons can be saved per person per year if a resident installs one new high-efficiency toilet, faucet and shower head in his home. If there are 2.5 people in the household, the savings totals 47.3 million gallons per day across the region, the group calculated.  

Bethea described her estimate as ""very conservative"" because many homes have more than one toilet or 2.5 residents. It doesn’t include savings when the upgraded plumbing fixes leaks, either.

We found that Riverkeeper numbers are optimistic.

The group’s figure for households with old-fashioned plumbing is out of date, according to data from the Water Planning District. Last year, it was about 615,000, or 27 percent less.  

And Bethea’s estimate for the amount of water saved per toilet is high. Her group assumed those toilets would date from the 1980s or earlier. The older the toilet, the more water it uses.

But Atlanta’s housing stock is relatively new. Under an existing rebate program that will last until 2025, the Water Planning District expects the region to save 14 million gallons per day if 57 percent of homeowners use the program.

District figures do not include savings from installing more efficient faucets and shower heads. But since those fixtures combined use thousands of gallons per year less than toilets, we think it’s reasonable to expect that they would not increase the amount of water saved to nearly 50 million gallons per day.  

In addition, the Atlanta region has characteristics that could weaken the impact of a New York City-style program. The Big Apple has far more apartments, which meant persuading a single apartment building owner to change made a dramatic difference. Plus property owners had a big incentive to switch toilets quickly because of changes in how the city billed for water.

To Bethea’s credit, she used careful language. She said the region ""could"" save 50 million gallons per day, not that it ""would.""  And while saving nearly 50 million gallons of water per day appears unlikely in light of water district numbers, it isn’t impossible.

The region could have a higher-than-expected participation rate or proportion of very old toilets. The amount of water saved because the new plumbing fixes leaks could boost the total, and changing toilets over three years rather than 14 (under the rebate) does save more water, total.

Therefore Bethea’s fundamental point rings true. A New York-style program ""could"" save 50 million gallons per day. The amount could easily be much lower, but even more conservative estimates place the savings in the range of tens of millions of gallons per day",Mostly True,"April 4, 2011"
Says Supreme Court candidate JoAnne Kloppenburg’s record as a state Justice Department lawyer consists only of the prosecution of cases regarding regulation of docks.,"
The candidates in the acrimonious race for Wisconsin Supreme Court have spent a considerable amount of time focusing on their experience and qualifications for the job.

Justice David Prosser’s experience is pretty simple to understand. He has served a dozen years on the court and was Outagamie County district attorney for a couple of years. A Republican, Prosser also served 16 years in the state Assembly, and was speaker.

The JoAnne Kloppenburg file is more difficult to evaluate: 21 years as an attorney in the state Department of Justice.

That leaves plenty of room for interpretation -- by the candidate and her opponent. That’s what happened in a March 21, 2011, debate at the Marquette University Law School.

Prosser told the audience that Kloppenburg ""is incredibly envious"" of his record as a district attorney, and his time as a lawmaker and justice. He said he had prosecuted cases that involved violent crime.

""I’ve had victims of crime cry on my shoulder,"" Prosser said.

He continued with this observation about Kloppenburg’s experience: ""She has a very different record as a prosecutor. It’s all the prosecution of DNR regulations of docks … the length of docks. The width of docks. Whether people can have docks. That’s a complete different kind of prosecution that I am familiar with or have been writing cases about as well for 12 and a half years.""

That stopped us and undoubtedly many in the audience.

More than two decades on cases hassling dock owners? Sounds like a lot of legal grunt work.

It’s a claim that Prosser has made repeatedly on the campaign trail, and a theme that’s been picked up in ads from outside groups attacking Kloppenburg.

We asked for backup.

Prosser’s campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir said in an email that state court records and other research tools showed 46 cases that involved Kloppenburg, 76 percent of which ""were for the DNR.""  

""Of the 46, five were directly identifiable with piers,"" he said.

Fair enough. For a decade, Kloppenburg led the Department of Justice’s environmental litigation team. Docks would be in her wheelhouse.

Kloppenburg opponents have seized on her record as a environmental lawyer, painting her as an extremist. On March 29, talk show host Charlie Sykes said: ""If you are an environmental zealot, I do understand that JoAnne Kloppenburg is probably your candidate.""

Sykes added: ""If you have a pier that’s a few feet too close … JoAnne Kloppenburg is your worst enemy.""

But let’s circle back to the support Prosser’s campaign provided. Of the 46 cases cited, only five dealt with docks. What about the rest?  

The Kloppenburg campaign gave us a list of 17 published decisions of cases that she argued before the state Appeals Court. The cases involved water and air pollution permits, a landfill dispute and the state’s authority over navigable waterways. Two involved the civil rights of state prison inmates, one involved the treatment of a prisoner. No dock cases were included.

The campaign noted that over the years, Kloppenburg has argued hundreds of cases in circuit courts around the state, and numerous cases before the state Supreme Court -- including one in which a decision was handed down March 23,  two days after the debate at Marquette.

In that case, Kloppenburg represented the state in a lawsuit involving a dispute over a hearing for a water discharge permit for a paper mill in Green Bay. Environmentalists wanted a public hearing about the permit; the DNR did not. Kloppenburg represented the DNR and won the case -- with Prosser voting with the majority. While environmentalists were unhappy with the decision, business groups -- some of which are paying for ads attacking Kloppenburg’s legal credentials -- were pleased.

She said her campaign was able to identify citations of 206 court cases dating back to 1989, and said few, if any, involved docks or piers.

Other cases she’s handled in her career included those involving complaints from prisoners, the state’s part of lawsuits against big tobacco companies, Indian treaty rights and gaming compacts, and medical malpractice caps. She has had numerous cases involving well-known state and local companies, including Patrick Cudahy, Enbridge, Georgia Pacific, and a sunken barge in the Menomonee River.

Kloppenburg told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial board that her job was to enforce the state’s environmental laws.

When we asked Prosser directly to explain his comment, he said he was well aware Kloppenburg handled a much broader variety of cases for the Justice Department than docks. Indeed, a number of them were argued before him on the Supreme Court.

""I’m certainly aware of the breadth of those cases,"" Prosser said, adding that his comments about docks were ""a little rhetorical flourish.""

Prosser recalled a case about a July 2006 decision about a Green Lake subdivision that let homeowners have a fractional interest so they could have a boat slip on a nearby dock. The court ruled in favor of the DNR and forced the association to reduce the number of boat slips. Prosser also mentioned another case that was relayed to him in a private letter from a circuit court judge in northern Wisconsin.

""Those are the two I was most familiar with,"" Prosser said.

He added this about his dock comment: ""I was really trying to inject a little bit of levity into this. I think the rhetorical flourish is easily justified in terms of these two cases.""

But that flies in the face of the reality of the campaign. As we noted, the dock cases have emerged as a line of attack against Kloppenburg from several fronts. What’s more, those in the audience didn’t offer a lot of chuckles during that portion of the debate.

Former Journal Sentinel reporter Alan Borsuk, who now works for the Marquette Law School, blogged this about the event: ""I’ve been at some testy and tense debates and joint appearances by candidates in various races, but this one was way up the list, if it wasn’t the champion on my personal list.""

Borsuk noted the exchange about experience and said Prosser touted his record ""while slighting her record in environmental work with the attorney general’s office as involving ‘the length of (boat) docks.’""

Let’s bring this ship to shore.

Justice Prosser told a debate audience that his opponent’s work as a prosecutor was very limited and said she only handled cases involving the size and length of docks. But the record shows a much broader range of cases handled by Kloppenburg in her time at the Department of Justice. Indeed, Prosser later said he was well aware of the ""breadth"" of those cases.

What’s more, Prosser brushed the claim off as a ""rhetorical flourish"" and an attempt at ""levity."" That would be more believable if people treated it that way at the time and if it didn’t match up with one of the major lines of attack from Kloppenburg critics in the campaign",False,"April 1, 2011"
Says new EPA water regulations would force the state to make drainage canals every bit as clean as pristine Florida river systems.,"
Proposed rules to improve Florida water quality standards have spiraled into a political war of words pitting environmentalists and the federal Environmental Protection Agency against Florida's business interests and much of the state's political leadership.

Most of the fight -- about something called numeric nutrient criteria -- probably makes little sense to you, if you heard about it at all.

Here are the basics. Inhale ... Back in 1998, the EPA told all states that they had to develop limits on nutrient pollution in state waterways -- nutrients being pollutants like nitrogen and phosphorus that cause toxic algae blooms that can kill fish and cause respiratory problems and infections among swimmers, boaters and beachgoers. The states had until 2004 to come up with the limits. But 2004 came and went in Florida with no action. So environmentalists from groups like Earthjustice, Sierra Club, the Florida Wildlife Federation, the Conservancy of Southwest Florida, the Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida and the St. Johns Riverkeeper sued the EPA. The state Department of Environmental Protection said it had been working on setting up specific nutrient limits since 2001 but had not yet finished because of the thousands of waterways in the state and the different ecological challenges they face. Anyway, the EPA settled the lawsuit with the environmentalists and said it would produce water quality rules for Florida, which it did (except for South Florida) in November 2010. Those new regulations, which set numeric limits on the nutrients allowed in all Florida and state inland waterways, take effect in March 2012.

What the exact limits are is of little consequence in that you'd have to be a scientist to understand them. Suffice it to say, they're strict enough that business groups are vexed that it will cost billions of dollars to clean up because so many Florida waterways are considered ""impaired"" -- meaning the water isn't safe for humans or where certain aquatic life could no longer live. In an economy with 11.5 percent unemployment, the ""billions"" has people worried -- particularly municipalities, businesses and farmers who are producing the pollution.

Enter a group calling itself Free Market Florida, which has begun a political campaign to stop the regulations from being implemented. The group's leader, Ryan Houck, was part of a business-backed group that successfully fought against a ballot initiative in 2010 known as Amendment 4 (the measure would have given voters final approval on major development proposals).

Free Market Florida launched a two-minute, 30-second web video that details the threat of the new EPA criteria to Florida's economy.

""Imagine that you own a restaurant, and the health department tells you that the floors on which you walk need to be as clean as the plates on which you serve food,"" Houck says in the ad, looking directly at the camera. ""Then you open the newspaper and find out that someone's suing a fast food restaurant because their 99-cent cheeseburgers aren't as good as a $40 steak at a fancy restaurant. That's crazy, right?""

The ad then cuts to Houck standing in front of a drainage canal.

""Now what if I told you taxpayers, businesses, farmers and consumers had to spend billions of dollars to make drainage canals like this one every bit as clean as the water here (video cuts to Houck in front of a river) in the Wekiva River ... It may sound absurd, but it's about to happen right here in Florida.""

Houck goes on to call the regulations debilitating, unscientific and costly, and says that it is all part of a plan by environmentalists not to curb pollution, but to stop development.

Of the many things worth fact-checking in the ad, one claim stood out to us -- Houck's suggestion that the EPA is requiring man-made drainage canals be every bit as clean as natural, flowing rivers.

We asked the four stakeholders in this argument -- Houck, the environmentalists, the EPA and the state DEP -- if that's right.

We got four very different answers.

""We went to great lengths to make sure the ad was accurate. We're glad you're checking it."" -- Ryan Houck, Free Market Florida.

""That characterization is simply false."" -- David Guest, lawyer for Earthjustice.

""There are likely circumstances where the same criteria that applies to the Wekiva River would also apply to a nearby canal."" -- Dee Ann Miller, DEP spokeswoman.

""This high level of protection is likely not required for any drainage canal, therefore, the drainage canal pictured is not required to have water 'every bit as clean as the water in the Wekiva River.' "" -- Davina Marraccini, EPA spokeswoman.

The differing answers at first had us puzzled -- until we had an epiphany.

The answers underscore just how complex these water regulations are.

Understanding the regulations

For starters, we need to understand just what the regulations are, and are not. The regulations affect lakes and inland rivers and streams. More generally, they affect the water we drink (categorized as Class I bodies of water) and water we use for recreation or that supports aquatic life (Class III). Class III waters would include drainage canals that link other flowing bodies of water. But the regulations wouldn't affect drainage ditches or retention ponds, necessarily.

The EPA set different requirements for lakes and rivers and streams. Lakes in the state are measured based on the color and alkalinity. Criteria for rivers and streams are divided into five geographic regions in the state. Each geographic region has its own criteria.

So while lakes across Florida would have the same pollution standards, rivers and streams would not. The different regions were created to account for natural phosphorus levels in some parts of the state relative to others.

Now, it's critical to note -- as we already have once -- that none of the rules in place apply to the areas in South Florida (roughly south of Lake Okeechobee). Those standards will not be proposed until November 2011. The rules also do not apply to estuaries, coastal waters and wetlands.

Another important point, especially for the sake of this fact check: South Florida is home to the predominant number of the state's canal systems, said Earthjustice's Guest. 
About 1,000 miles of canals exist as part of the ""Central and Southern Florida Project,"" a congressionally authorized project to control flooding and supply water for municipal, industrial and agricultural uses, and for prevention of saltwater intrusion. Many but not all of those canals are in the designated South Florida region and thus exempted from the proposed standards.

Comparing to the Wekiva

Houck told PolitiFact Florida that the canal pictured in the video is not in South Florida, and is classified as a Class III water.

If that's the case, the man-made canal would be regulated under the pending rules, and it would have to meet the same standards as natural rivers in the same geographic area.

But this fact check isn't that simple. Free Market Florida chose to compare the canal to the Wekiva River, a 30-mile-long river system that starts in Central Florida and runs into the St. Johns River. The Wekiva River has been designated an Outstanding Florida Water by the state, which means it receives the ""highest protection,"" according to state policy.

""OFWs are afforded higher protection, above and beyond normal requirements of a Class III water (that is, waters suitable for fishing and swimming), to maintain outstanding water quality and prevent degradation,"" the EPA's Marraccini told us. ""This high level of protection is likely not required for any drainage canal; therefore, the drainage canal pictured is not required to have water 'every bit as clean as the water in the Wekiva River.' ""

Houck argues that the levels of protection for Outstanding Florida Waters and the EPA numeric nutrient criteria counts measure different things, and therefore are immaterial. And Houck is correct that Outstanding Florida Waters are required to maintain the water quality standard that was in place in March 1, 1979 (Page 32 of these rules), not specific numeric nutrient criteria limits.

Proposed rule changes

There's another important and complex clarification to the pending EPA standards: The state is in the process of trying to change the rules so that many man-made canals might not have the same regulations as rivers.

The state's Environmental Regulation Commission has proposed creating a subset of Class III waters that would include man-made canals. Those waters would have to meet different and lower standards than regular Class III waters. The state provides a good visual explanation of the changes they are considering on slides 21-25 of this presentation.

""The Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) rule does apply as the video states,"" said DEP spokeswoman Jennifer Diaz. ""This situation exists because Florida’s current classification of rivers and streams does not distinguish between artificially created waters and natural free-flowing waters. About a year ago, the Environmental Regulation Commission (ERC) approved the creation of a new class of waters for artificially created and significantly altered surface waters. Although adopted by ERC, the new classification is subject to approval by EPA before it can become effective in Florida. Until this new classification is approved by EPA, no waters in Florida can be classified with a lower use expectation. Therefore, the nutrient criteria adopted by EPA that becomes effective in March 2012 will apply equally to man-made ditches/canals and natural streams.""

More caveats

And yet, there are more complications. The EPA says that if the state can show -- based on a structured scientific assessment -- that a canal cannot meet its current designated use, the state could downgrade the use of the body of water and the numeric criteria counts would not apply.

""Factors considered in determining whether to downgrade a classification include naturally occurring pollutants and the physical conditions of the water body, as well as whether the pollution controls required would result in substantial and widespread economic and social impact, among others,"" the EPA's Marraccini said.

Houck says this can lead to more lawsuits.

Lastly, we need to address the cost. While we're not fact-checking how much the remediation will cost, we think it's important to note there is wide disagreement on potential financial impact. The EPA says the cost to clean Florida's waters will be $135 million to $206 million a year. A private study pegged the costs astronomically higher -- anywhere from $1 billion to $8.4 billion annually.

Our ruling

We hope we didn't lose you in explaining these complicated requirements, and how they match up to the claim in Free Market Florida's ad. After weeks of studying this issue, we are more convinced than ever just how complicated the proposed rules to regulate Florida's water systems are.

The bottom line is Free Market Florida contends that man-made drainage canals will have to meet the same standards as pristine Florida river systems like the Wekiva River in Central Florida.

As the regulations stand now, it appears that drainage canals designated as Class III waters in Central Florida would have to meet the same numeric nutrient standards as the Wekiva River. But there are several caveats that could impact the validity of that claim. For one, rules haven't been implemented for South Florida (home to the many drainage canals). Two, all drainage canals wouldn't have to meet the water quality standards of the Wekiva, just the ones in the geographic area. Three, the state is proposing a change to the rules that could exempt many of the state's drainage canals. And four, the EPA also says it could exempt individual drainage canals based on scientific study.

Houck said his group made sure the drainage canal they showed is in the same region as the Wekiva, which in his mind explains away the first two caveats. The third and fourth caveats are possible changes that are not a sure thing.

Where does this all leave us?

Houck and his group are largely right based on all the evidence we reviewed. We wish he would have explained a little more of the nuance in the video, but we also are realists",Mostly True,"March 30, 2011"
"Woonsocket needs a garbage-burning power plant because ""residents are paying through the nose for electricity that’s fueled by foreign oil, at prices that are skyrocketing.""","
State Rep. Jon D. Brien, D-Woonsocket, has proposed legislation that would override Rhode Island’s 20-year ban on trash incinerators and permit Woonsocket to host a waste-to-energy plant.

In a news release from the State House, and later at a hearing on Thursday before his House Committee on Municipal Government, Brien made two arguments.

First, he said it makes no sense to continue dumping garbage at the Rhode Island Central Landfill, which the state has to continually expand, especially because the garbage could be transformed into a viable alternative energy resource.

""Rather than burying trash in the ground and that being the end of it, why not use it to create electricity?"" Brien said in an interview.

That puzzled us, because the state’s Resource Recovery Corporation already generates electricity from garbage, collecting methane gas produced by the decomposing trash deep in the landfill and piping it to a commercial plant that burns the gas to produce power.

But it was his second point -- that the waste-to-energy plant is needed because  ""residents are paying through the nose for electricity that’s fueled by foreign oil, at prices that are skyrocketing"" -- that really jumped out at us.

Power plants in Rhode Island converted long ago from burning oil to burning natural gas. Most new plants burn natural gas. The one big exception remains the Brayton Point power plant in Somerset that burns coal, and a little natural gas.

So we wondered how the Woonsocket waste-to-energy plant that Brien supports would have any effect on our dependence on foreign oil.

We contacted ISO New England, the independent, not-for-profit corporation that oversees the distribution of electricity throughout New England. Spokeswoman Ellen Foley directed us to a chart showing electric power energy sources in New England.

The chart shows that natural gas accounted for 32 percent of  the power generation in New England in 2010. Nuclear was the next biggest source, at 29 percent. Coal generated 11 percent of New England’s power. Hydropower generated another 5.5 percent. Renewable sources such as wind, solar, and landfill gases provide 6 percent.

The power plants that can run on either oil or natural gas produced 12 percent of the region’s power. But ISO officials say they burn mostly gas, because oil is so expensive.

In fact, it’s so expensive that the amount of power generated by oil, according to ISO, was only 0.4 percent. In other words, nearly zero.

When we asked Brien about this discrepancy, he insisted that oil is used to generate electricity used locally.  And with oil trading at a two-year high, he said it is possible that oil is affecting electricity prices. That is certainly true nationally, he said.

No, it’s not. Nationally, oil produces less than one percent of the nation’s electricity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Bottom line: an extremely small percentage of Rhode Island’s and New England’s electricity comes from high-priced foreign oil.

One would expect a state representative who is pushing a power plant in his district to know that",False Pants on Fire,"March 27, 2011"
"""Not even expensive bottled water, like Perrier and Evian, are of good enough quality to pump out of mines in Southwest Virginia, according to the EPA regulation.""","
What do French bottled water and Appalachian streams have in common?

More than you might think, according to Rep. H. Morgan Griffith, R-9th. A vocal opponent of the Environmental Protection Agency, the southwest Virginia legislator pledged in February to roll back regulations governing water from mountain-top mining areas.

""Not even expensive bottled water, like Perrier and Evian, are of good enough quality to pump out of mines in Southwest Virginia, according to the EPA regulation,"" Griffith wrote.

Standards so strict that Perrier and Evian would fail? We couldn’t swallow that without checking. We had two questions: Would fancy bottled water really fail a conductivity test? And would that sort of test actually tell us anything about the safety of the bottled water?

First, a word about EPA the standards and how mountain-top mining works. This form of mining relies on explosives to expose coal seams in far southwest Virginia and West Virginia. The controlled explosions generate huge piles of debris that often bury nearby valleys.

In April 2010 the EPA said ""the resulting waste that then fills valleys and streams can significantly compromise water quality, often causing permanent damage to ecosystems and rendering streams unfit for swimming, fishing and drinking.""

The agency established a new purity standard for streams near coal mining areas, saying it was updating provisions of the Clean Water Act to set new conductivity levels. Conductivity is a measurement of how well water transmits an electrical charge and gives a reading on the amount of dissolved solids in water.

The EPA set a maximum conductivity of 500 microSiemens per centimeter, which the agency says is about five times higher than a normal level and should ""protect 95 percent of aquatic life in the coal regions.""

Emily Bernhardt, an associate professor of biology at Duke University, studies water quality in coal-mining areas. She told us conductivity is a ""really inexpensive way to see if you have a lot of constituents in water.""

In coal-mining regions, she said, conductivity is correlated with sulfate. Pyrite, a mineral made up of coal and sulphur ions, is found in coal seams and filters into water.

She said if water near coal mines has high conductivity, it usually contains a lot of sulfates and metals. Streams in mining areas often show elevated sulfur levels, as well as higher levels of iron, selenium and manganese. But the test is designed solely for rural Appalachia, not for use  across the country. In urban areas, for example, high conductivity may occur when road salt is washed into streams.

So how do Perrier and Evian seep into this debate?

Beth Breeding, Griffith’s press secretary, told us the congressman’s comments were based on the EPA’s conductivity guidance. But the EPA website makes no mention of Perrier or other bottled waters.

Griffith’s claim appears to come from Alpha Natural Resources, the nation’s third-largest coal mining company. A PowerPoint slide circulated by the company says Evian, Perrier and San Pellegrino would all fail EPA conductivity tests.

We asked Rick Nida, a spokesman for Alpha, whether his company thinks the EPA test is a fair way to evaluate the impact of mountain-top mining.

""We don’t think it’s a good standard to use,"" he said. ""The point is rules are so stringent that bottle water doesn’t pass.  

Richard Yost, a spokesman for the EPA, said the standards are designed to protect aquatic species in the water, not necessarily determine whether the water is safe to drink.

""The science demonstrates that stream life present in waters contaminated by mine waste is killed when salinity levels rise above levels that would not be toxic to humans who may drink such water,"" Yost said.  ""Aquatic organisms and people respond to salinity in very different ways, so it is not technically valid to make direct comparisons between healthy levels of salinity in central Appalachian streams and acceptable levels of salinity in drinking water.""

Rather than rely on Alpha’s conductivity data, we put these bottled waters to the test. Paul Bukaveckas, an associate professor of biology at Virginia Commonwealth University who studies river ecology, invited us to conduct the tests at his lab.  

Mac Lee, a laboratory specialist at VCU, used a sensor he and Bukaveckas employ on the James River. We tested the conductivity of distilled water, Evian, Perrier, Pellegrino and, last of all, a sample taken from the James River in downtown Richmond.

Here were our test results:
  
So the bottled water has a conductivity level higher than the EPA’s 500 microSiemens threshold. We asked Bernhardt and Bukaveckas if that is a relevant piece of information.

Bukaveckas, the VCU biologist, said the argument reminds him of those raised 20 years ago by power companies disputing the impact -- or even existence -- of acid rain.

""They’d point to lakes and say, ‘These are naturally acidic.’ But if you did water tests, you’d find that undamaged lakes were acidic because of organic or naturally occurring acids,"" he said.

The damaged lakes, in contrast, contained acids created by emissions from the smokestacks of power plants.

Bernhardt, of Duke, said water is different in each environment, making a comparison between French springs and Appalachian streams pointless.

""The EPA’s data find that high conductivity is most closely correlated with the loss of species,"" Bernhardt said about Appalachian water. ""Salty water makes it harder for freshwater fish to live. So maybe it is bad for freshwater fish to be dumped in Pellegrino, but that’s not the right argument to have.""

Let’s review our findings.

After conducting an independent test, we agree with Griffith’s claim that Perrier, Evian and Pellegrino all have conductivity levels above the limits the EPA sets for streams in Appalachian coal areas.

But the fact that a Pellegrino bath could kill Virginia’s fish population is irrelevant to these water standards. According to independent water experts, high conductivity in coal country strongly correlates with the loss of aquatic species.

Griffith sought to confuse the issue with a non sequitur about bottled water. Saying Perrier is good for humans and therefore must be OK for fish seems to us like saying that because humans eat oranges, fish should too.

"""Lake Erie supports nearly 10 percent of Ohio's jobs and generates $750 million in state and local taxes.""","
Cuts in government spending aim to reduce the deficit and bring the budget closer to balance. But the process can be more complicated than that.

That point was made when U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar went before the House Committee on Natural Resources this month to testify about President Obama's proposed fiscal 2012 budget request.

Rep. Betty Sutton noted the economic benefits the department helps spur in Ohio, as she focused on the budget recommendation to cut $125 million from the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. Sutton called the initiative ""incredibly important"" to the region economically.

""Lake Erie supports nearly 10 percent of Ohio's jobs and generates $750 million in state and local taxes,"" she said.

PolitiFact Ohio wondered where those figures came from, and took a look.

The long-range Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, developed by a task force of 11 federal agencies, aims to clean up toxic sediment and polluted areas, combating invasive species such as Asian carp, restore degraded wetlands and support fish and wildlife resources.

Obama requested $350 million for the program for fiscal 2012, down from the $475 million standard of 2010. The initiative was chopped to $225 million, or less than half of that, by a plan from House Republicans to cut $61 billion in federal spending.

We asked Sutton's office to cite her source for data on the Lake Erie’s economic impact. They referred us to the Great Lakes Commission, a cooperative formed by the eight Great Lakes states and Canada in 1955. One of the commission's fact sheets did have those numbers, and others, which were attributed to the commission's own studies and a variety of official sources.

The tax figure, credited by the commission to a fact sheet from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, ultimately came from Ohio Travel & Tourism, part of the Department of Development. It said that Lake Erie tourism generated $430 million in state tax revenue and $320 million in local tax revenue -- together totaling the $750 million Sutton cited.

But the commission's communications director, Christine Manninen, told us the jobs figure Sutton relied on was stated erroneously in the March 2011 fact sheet, in a paragraph that jumbled lake-related and statewide figures. The online fact sheet was corrected after the hearing where Sutton cited it.

It is the state's tourism industry that accounts for nearly 10 percent of Ohio's more than 5 million jobs, according to Ohio Travel & Tourism. Nevertheless, Lake Erie does support a large number of jobs -- more than 100,000 in northeast Ohio. 
Sutton relied on a credible official source for her numbers, and she cited them accurately, though one of her sources, a credible one at that, misstated its data.

"""Twenty percent of our electricity currently comes from nuclear power plants. I think there are 104 in the United States, two of them around the coast in California.""","
The extensive damage to Japanese nuclear facilities following the massive earthquake and tsunami of March 11, 2011, has focused more attention on nuclear power than it has received in years.

On the March 13, 2011, edition of Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace asked Bill Kristol, editor of the conservative magazine the Weekly Standard, about how the situation in Japan could affect the use of nuclear power in the United States.

""Bill, at a time when Democrats and Republicans were finally getting together and supporting nuclear power as safe, clean, non-polluting energy, and President Obama had $36 billion in loan credits in his 2012 budget to promote more plants, what happens now to the domestic industry?"" Wallace asked.

Kristol responded, ""Well, we can probably save $36 billion from the 2012 budget because I think it's a bit of a setback to nuclear power here in the U.S. I'll go out on a limb and make that prediction.

""But, you know, people will say, well, we build new plants. Twenty percent of our electricity currently comes from nuclear power plants. I think there are 104 in the United States, two of them around the coast in California. Very earthquake-resistant, but I guess there could be a tsunami there. It sounds like it's the tsunami that did the most damage in Japan.

""So, on the one hand, it's impressive how resistant these things are to damage. On the other hand, I do think, as you say, these alarming fears, whether or not they -- certainly if they come to fruition, and let's hope they don't -- it's obviously a setback to nuclear power. And I think it makes even stronger the case for going after natural gas and oil domestically.""

We wondered whether Kristol’s statistics on electricity generation and the number of nuclear plants were correct -- and we figured our readers would be too. So we looked into it.

We first turned to the Statistical Abstract of the United States, a compendium of statistics published by the U.S. Census Bureau. It includes a table summarizing electricity generation by fuel type through 2009. Dividing net electric generation via nuclear power by net generation in the electric power sector as a whole, we get 20.9 percent. That’s close enough to Kristol’s comment to pass muster with us.

Next, we turned to the website of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The agency has a page where you can find active nuclear generating facilities on a map and in alphabetical order. We counted them up, and there are exactly 104 sites listed.

Kristol’s only error was in suggesting that there are 104 nuclear power plants; in fact, there are 104 nuclear power reactors. Because many plants have more than one reactor, the actual number of plants is 65. (This list doesn’t count military and scientific reactors, which are not overseen by the agency.)

Finally, we checked Kristol's claim about nuclear facilities on the California coast. There are, in fact, two: Diablo Canyon, located 12 miles from San Luis Obispo, and San Onofre, located 46 miles from Long Beach. The photographs on the agency's website clearly show that the plants are located near the water.

So Kristol was basically correct, only erring with his mislabeling of ""reactors"" as ""plants",Mostly True,"March 16, 2011"
"Says that President Obama said in 2008 that his proposed greenhouse gas regulations ""will bankrupt"" anyone who wants to build a new coal-fired power plant.","It’s 2008 all over again, based on a claim that recently surfaced from Ohio’s coal industry. That was the year Barack Obama won the presidency. Ten months earlier, the candidate -- a Democratic senator from Illinois who was campaigning for the presidential nomination -- did a wide-ranging, videotaped interview with the San Francisco Chronicle’s editorial board that included his prescription for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Before the campaign would end, his political opponents, including Sarah Palin, discovered the interview on the newspaper’s website and tried to use it against Obama in coal-rich states like Ohio. Maybe you’ve forgotten about it. The coal industry, in a long battle against proposals to cut greenhouse gas emissions by reducing coal use, has not.

Mike Carey, president of the Ohio Coal Association, brought up Obama’s statement anew when he testified March 1 to a House subcommittee on energy and power, in advance of a proposed House Republican bill that would strip the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency of its ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

""We absolutely must oppose the new effort by the Obama administration to eliminate coal through the new proposed plant emissions and greenhouse gas regulations,"" Carey said. ""In 2008, President Obama said, ‘If someone wants to build a new coal-fired power plant they can, but it will bankrupt them because they will be charged a huge sum for all the greenhouse gas that’s being emitted.’ ""

Later in his testimony, Carey added, ""Remember what President Obama promised; they will bankrupt anyone who plans to build a coal facility.""

Did Obama really promise that?

It’s a question that matters in states that employ coal miners and rely on coal-fired electricity, especially as the U.S. EPA under Obama prepares to restrict carbon emissions.

During a break in the House hearing, we asked Carey for his source for the quote. Then we
went back to the original San Francisco Chronicle interview in its entirety, transcribed the parts in which Obama discussed coal, and examined the context of Obama’s remarks.

Obama at the time had proposed an aggressive plan to reduce the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by attaching a price for emissions. The allowable level of emissions would ratchet down yearly, Obama said, with money raised from this system getting invested in cleaner technologies. This would not only create incentives for reducing carbon emissions, he said, but it would also expand the use of wind and solar power, bio-fuels and, potentially, ""clean coal,"" in which carbon emissions could be captured and sequestered in a way that might do no harm. Such clean coal research is ongoing, with vigorous debate as to whether it will someday be applied on a commercial scale.

Obama made clear in the interview that he was not suggesting an end to coal use. Too much of the country already uses it in existing power plants and factories. In a portion of the interview his critics failed to note, he said:

""This notion of no coal, I think, is an illusion, because the fact of the matter is that right now, we are getting a lot of our energy from coal, and China is building a coal-fired plant once a week. So what we have to do then is we have to figure out how can we use coal without emitting greenhouse gases and carbon.  And how can we sequester that carbon and capture it? If we can't, then we're going to still be working on alternatives.""

But Obama also made clear that he wanted to transition away from building new coal-fired plants, saying that the price on emissions for building one -- using old technology -- would be prohibitive under his plan.

Carey said in his testimony that the Obama administration ""promised"" a ""war on coal,"" which is a claim we believe goes too far. The Obama administration has unquestionably angered the coal industry with rules or proposals affecting air quality standards, coal ash, renewable energy and the issuance of permits needed for coal mining -- all mentioned by Carey in his testimony. But Obama never declared war, and environmentalists and many others have a very different take on this so-called assault.

Yet Obama said exactly what Carey quoted him as saying on a point that is especially current, considering the EPA’s new rules, announced this year. To repeat the then-candidate’s statement: ""If someone wants to build a new coal-fired power plant they can, but it will bankrupt them because they will be charged a huge sum for all the greenhouse gas that's being emitted.""

Why, then, aren’t we rating Carey’s claim True?

Two reasons: ""President Obama"" did not make the statement. Obama the U.S. senator and candidate for president did. And that leads to the second reason.

Carey suggests that Obama is carrying out the threat he made in 2008, but the new rules from the EPA are different from the cap-and-trade proposal Obama had in 2008. Candidate Obama’s methods were to be more aggressive. In fact, the EPA has shown some flexibility, agreeing to phase in carbon restrictions on new or expanded plants based on their size. The agency also announced on the same day as Carey testified that it will delay its deadlines for businesses that must report their emissions.

Carey quoted Obama accurately but not fully, and the regulations and methods that Obama’s EPA wants -- backed by a U.S. Supreme Court decision saying the agency has to regulate greenhouse gas emissions -- are not the same as the candidate proposed",Mostly True,"March 14, 2011"
"A bill that would halt the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases would help ""stop rising gas prices.""","
To hear Reps. Fred Upton and Ed Whitfield talk about their new energy bill, you'd think it will prevent gas prices from increasing before your next fill-up.

Upton, the Michigan Republican who chairs the influential Energy and Commerce Committee, and Ed Whitfield, the Kentucky Republican who heads the Energy and Power subcommittee, recently argued in a letter to fellow lawmakers that one way to stop rising gas prices would be to pass the Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011 (H.R. 910).

The bill grows out of longstanding frustration by industry groups and lawmakers who believe that Environmental Protection Agency regulations unnecessarily burden many companies.

The measure -- which Whitfield’s subcommittee approved on March 10, 2011, and which now heads to the full committee -- would prevent the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases for the purpose of addressing climate change.

Here’s a portion of what Upton and Whitfield wrote to their colleagues in the March 8, 2011, letter, which is headlined, ""Concerned About High Gas Prices? Cosponsor H.R. 910 and Make a Difference Today!""

""Whether through greenhouse gas regulation, permit delays, or permanent moratoriums, the White House takes every opportunity to decrease access to safe and secure sources of oil and natural gas,"" the lawmakers wrote. ""Gasoline prices have climbed dramatically over the past three months. American consumers deal with this hardship every day, and as this poll indicates, the majority of respondents do not see the pain subsiding anytime soon.  Americans also understand the realities of supply and demand as it relates to oil prices. Unfortunately the White House does not. ...

""H.R. 910, the Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011, is the first in this legislative series to stop rising gas prices by halting EPA’s Clean Air Act greenhouse gas regulations. As one small refiner testifying before the Committee on Energy and Commerce put it: ‘EPA’s proposed [greenhouse gas] regulations for both refinery expansions and existing facilities will likely have a devastating effect on … all of our nation’s fuels producers….  If small refiners are forced out of business, competition will suffer and American motorists, truckers and farmers will be increasingly reliant on foreign refiners to supply our nation’s gasoline and diesel fuel.’

""We … have taken the first steps in attempting to restrain this regulatory overreach that will restrict oil supplies and cause gasoline prices to rise.""

But can the bill really stop gas prices from going up, as the letter says?

We’ll look at two key questions. Could the proposed EPA regulations on oil refineries actually increase prices at the pump? And when would the impact of the regulations be felt?

As to the first question, experts had different opinions.

The oil industry argues that regulations imposing new costs on refiners could force U.S. refineries to charge more. (The proposed regulations are supposed to shield smaller operations from regulatory impacts, but experts said that a significant proportion of U.S. refineries would indeed be affected.)

""It’s Economics 101,"" said John Felmy, chief economist at the American Petroleum Institute. ""The refinery business is a very low-margin business. They have no margin for error and face tough competition internationally.""

Others argue the refining industry could adapt to new regulations.

""Looking at past public claims when the Clean Air Act was passed would show that U.S. refining capacity still managed to increase over time, despite the high expense refiners had to put out to comply with the Clean Air act,"" said Amy Myers Jaffe, a fellow in energy studies at Rice University.

""So one might imagine, depending on the details on how carbon regulation would be implemented, U.S. industry could likely similarly adjust,"" Jaffe said. ""It depends on the specifics of how a policy is implemented. There are no doubt some small refineries in the United States that might be really inefficient, so maybe some of them would close if they had to increase their costs substantially, but tiny, uncompetitive, regional refineries are not the main thing that makes the US refining and marketing industry ‘competitive.’""

Indeed, while a shift to overseas refiners could have negative consequences for the nation -- it could weaken the United States’ industrial base, threaten U.S. jobs and pose problems for national security -- it’s not a foregone conclusion that prices at the pump would rise. If U.S. refiners become less competitive and more oil is instead imported from overseas refiners, it will be because the cost of refining overseas becomes more competitive. That’s the essence of a free market.

And even if the cost of refining did go up, the cost of gasoline is volatile and affected by many factors such as global demand and supply disruptions. So there's no certainty that a bump in refining costs would necessarily translate into higher prices at the pump.

As for the second question -- when any impact might be felt -- the rules wouldn't take affect for months or years.

The EPA won't even propose the first-ever greenhouse-gas standards for refineries until December 2011 and doesn't plan to issue final standards until November 2012. Those standards would govern emissions for new and significantly overhauled refineries. Rules for existing refineries are expected to be unveiled in July 2011.

Based on the past history of EPA regulations, the new rules aren't likely to take effect until a few years after that, experts said.

So, if the bill were to pass, it would prevent EPA regulations that would otherwise take effect in 2013, 2014 or 2015. That’s a long way away.

Another factor: the regulations targeted by the House bill are new ones. So if the House bill passes, it would essentially protect the status quo -- not take any explicit action to stop price hikes.

So where does this leave us?

While Upton and Whitfield's letter is carefully worded, it frames the argument for the bill in the context of today’s trend of rising gasoline prices. Yet the impact of the bill -- if there is an one -- would be years away. And there's no proof that the law would actually stop gas prices from rising. The added regulations now being planned may hamper U.S. refiners, but the international free market could just as easily end up keeping refining costs low. And it’s hardly assured that any changes in refining costs -- up or down -- will influence gasoline prices, which are subject to a wide array of influenes",False,"March 14, 2011"
"""A new ruling by the EPA would force dairy farmers to comply with the Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Program when dealing with spilt milk -- the same regulations oil and natural gas producers must follow.""","
U.S. Rep. H. Morgan Griffith is milking his opposition to the Environmental Protection Agency for every last drop.

The Republican stressed his contempt for the agency throughout a heated campaign last fall in which Griffith unseated Democrat Rick Boucher, a 14-term congressman from coal-rich Southwest Virginia. In his victory speech, Griffith vowed to go to Washington and ""fight to rein in the EPA."" Since taking office, he has fired out a barrage of anti-EPA statements.

In a February newsletter to constituents, Griffith claimed that new EPA rules treat milk spills the same way they treat oil spills. He titled the newsletter ""Crying over spilt milk.""

""What do spilt milk and oil have in common?"" he wrote. ""Quite a bit, according to the EPA. In fact, a new ruling by the EPA would force dairy farmers to comply with the Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Program when dealing with spilt milk -- the same regulations oil and natural gas producers must follow. The EPA’s reasoning is that milk contains ‘a percentage of animal fats, which is a non-petroleum oil.’ It appears spilt milk is just as threatening as an oil spill.""

With visions of dairy farmers delicately dabbing milk off the wings of ducks, we looked into the claim.

Beth Breeding, Griffith’s press secretary, said her boss’s information came from the EPA’s website. So we went there.

Right away, we found problems with Griffith’s claim. The website says milk has been regulated under the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure program since 1973, when the Clean Water Act took effect. The law was passed by Congress the preceding year over the veto of Republican President Richard Nixon. So this is hardly a ""new ruling,"" as Griffith says. It has been in effect for 38 years.

The EPA site says ""since the SPCC rule became law in 1973, all kinds of oils including petroleum and edible oils (such as animal fats and vegetable oils) have been considered oils. This is because the SPCC rule gets its definition of ‘oil’ from the Clean Water Act, which was authored by Congress.""

The website also notes the rule only applies to farms storing more than 1,320 gallons of oil or milk.

So what’s new? According to the EPA, the only thing that comes close is a rule change it announced on Jan. 15, 2009. It goes in effect at the end of this month.

The simple purpose of the change is to exclude milk and dairy farms from the spill rules governing oil products. That’s the exact opposite of what Griffith claims. Here’s what the regulation says:

""EPA proposes to exempt milk containers and associated piping and appurtenances from the SPCC requirements provided they are constructed according to the current applicable 3-A Sanitary Standards, and are subject to the current applicable Grade ""A"" Pasteurized Milk Ordinance,"" or similar state laws.

Translated into plain English, the rule means milk storage will no longer have to meet the EPA’s oil spill rules, provided storage tanks meet pasteurization laws. In Virginia it is illegal to sell ""raw,"" or unpasteurized, milk, so the state’s dairy farmers should already be in compliance with the new standards.  

Raw milk is now legal for sale in 25 states, although 15 of those states only allow sales directly from a farm. So conceivably raw milk producers -- which are almost exclusively small operations, according to a group that advocates for raw milk -- might still need to comply with the SPCC rules. But this would affect only a very small fraction of total U.S. milk.

Baffled by how Griffith could have this claim so mixed up, we went back to his office for additional information. The second time around his press secretary pointed us to a Jan. 27 editorial in The Wall Street Journal that makes virtually the same claim. The editorial wrongly said new EPA rules will apply to dairy farms and cover milk storage. The amended rule only applies to petroleum products -- gasoline, fuel oil and the like -- that are stored in large quantities on dairy farms.  

Let’s review our findings.

Griffith claimed a ""new ruling by the EPA would force dairy farmers to comply"" with strict regulations for spills and leaks. He said the rules were the same as those enforced on oil and natural gas companies.

In fact, these regulations have been in place for 38 years and are not new at all. The ""new ruling"" from the EPA, announced in 2009 and taking effect in a few weeks, actually excludes milk from the spill standards, giving dairy farmers fewer regulations to meet. That’s the exact opposite of what Griffith claims.

Sure, Griffith got some of his information from an inaccurate editorial in The Wall Street Journal. But a  congressman who is railing against a federal agency has the means to get his facts right.

"""We closed that plant down. It was a $27 million-dollar plant, operating full steam, and we closed it down.""","
On Feb. 27, 2011, the Washington Post invited six new members of Congress to ""tell their tales in their own words."" Two of them were Floridians: Republican Rep. Allen West from District 22 and Rep. Frederica Wilson from District 17, both in Southeastern Florida.

Wilson, the Miami Democrat who was elected to Congress for the first time in November, recalled how, when she was principal at Skyway Elementary in the Carol City neighborhood outside Miami, Miami-Dade County permitted a garbage plant to be built across the street from her school.

The outcome, she said in the Washington Post article:  ""We closed that plant down. It was a $27 million-dollar plant, operating full steam, and we closed it down.""

We knew Wilson had a long track record as an educator before turning to politics. But she had a hand in closing a multimillion-dollar plant? We had to check it out. 

The plant in question was called Agripost and was built in November 1988 across the street from Skyway, the Carol City elementary school. Wilson, a veteran with the school system, was the principal.

County Hall had hoped that Agripost would help solve Miami-Dade’s trash problems by turning household trash into compost through a process of shredding and fermenting. The plant was to use the composting technology to convert household garbage into a soil additive for agricultural use.

""The county was looking for innovative ways to deal with the waste,"" Clerk of the Courts Harvey Ruvin, who then served as a commissioner, said in an interview.

But it didn't turn out as planned.  

After it opened, the plant at 20600 NW 47th Ave. emitted an odor that troubled Wilson and her students.

""It was awful,"" Wilson said by telephone. ""It smelled like rotting eggs and dog poo.""

And so the students made phone calls, wrote letters to government officials, and showed up at commission and school board meetings in red ""Skyway"" T-shirts. They stood on their tiptoes to reach the microphones.

""She was very forceful on behalf of the children, as I recall,"" Ruvin said.

Newspaper accounts credit Wilson for leading the charge.

""What was the plant's biggest nemesis?"" a Wall Street Journal report asked in a December 1991 article. ""The Skyway Elementary School across the street. Principal Frederica Wilson is a self-proclaimed environmentalist. But she claimed a stench from the plant permeated school grounds, causing children to vomit or have nosebleeds, and she led a revolt against the plant.""

The plant closed in January 1991, barely two years after it opened. One report in the Miami Herald, on Nov. 25, 1990, said Agripost spent $20 million to build the plant. Another, on Dec. 23, 1990, said it was a $25 million plant. 
Agripost appealed the commission's decision, and in 1994 sued the county for $140 million. According to a Miami Herald report on Oct. 4, 1994, the lawsuit claimed the company had invested $40 million in the plant and also sought $100 million in damages for the ""destruction of the company"" when county commissioners voted to revoke the company’s zoning authorization. The decision threw Agripost into bankruptcy.

Wilson said, ""We closed that plant down. It was a $27 million-dollar plant, operating full steam, and we closed it down."" (As for the different estimates for the cost of the plant, Wilson said by phone: ""You know how long that’s been? I don’t remember everything."") But after 20 years, her memory in the Washington Post article was on target",True,"March 7, 2011"
Says Oregon recyclers can't recycle plastic bags,"

Sen. Mark Hass, a Beaverton Democrat, is one of the most vocal supporters of the plastic bag ban making its way through the Oregon Legislature this session. It makes sense, then, that he’s been pretty vocal about correcting perceived untruths on the part of the plastics lobby.

In a Feb. 8, 2011, committee hearing on the ban, Hass called lobbyists out for saying that plastic bags are recyclable. Here’s what he had to say:

""You know, I think Oregonians would really love to recycle your (plastic bags). They really would. And if they could, we wouldn’t be here today. The whole point of the recyclers being in support of this is because they can’t recycle your bags.

""Four percent are turned in to the supermarkets (to be) sent over to China. You just heard that testimony.

""If Oregon recyclers could recycle your bags, there would be no need for this (bill). We want to be able to recycle them. But we can’t. And so they don’t get recycled, and they do end up on the beaches and in the ocean. And you keep referring to these things as being recyclable. And I just want to caution you on that because I think you’re stretching things when you say these are recyclable.""

We wondered whether Hass was right. Are plastic bags destined for the landfill and nothing else? So, we started off on a fact-checking mission with this as our claim: Oregon recyclers can’t recycle plastic bags.

To start, we called the city of Portland’s Bureau of Planning and Sustainability, which is home to the Solid Waste and Recycling Program. We asked Bruce Walker, the manager of the program, whether Portlanders could just slip the ubiquitous plastic grocery bags into their curbside bins like they can other common recyclables.

""Absolutely not,"" he said. ""We have tried our darnedest, through public education, to get that message out there. … They absolutely should not be put in a recycling cart.""

Walker added: ""Throughout the state of Oregon, there is no curbside program that wants these materials.""

Next stop was the recyclers themselves.

We called Jeff Murray, a vice president for Far West Fibers, a Portland-area recycling business. Murray also sits on the board of Oregon Recyclers Association, which has come out in favor of the plastic-bag ban. He spoke to us, however, from the point of view of Far West Fibers.

We asked him to walk us through the reasons plastic bags generally get the shaft from curbside recyclers. Are they recyclable or not?

He prefaced his comments with this: ""I have learned almost anything in this world is recyclable."" But some things are easier and more cost-effective to recycle.

The deal with plastic bags, at least as far as his business is concerned, is that they clog the sorting machines and unclogging those machines is more than just an inconvenience. ""It just jams,"" Murray said. ""It breaks … sometimes it can cause fires.""

""Basically, it shuts down the efficiency of the system.""

But, Murray added, ""plastic bags are recyclable in the right market.""

That market, he said, is generally overseas, and there are a couple of caveats. The market isn’t a dependable one. ""There are times when we don’t have markets to recycle it. That was the one material we had to landfill"" when the economy soured.

Even when there is a market, the product might not get recycled, he said. ""When it gets sent overseas, I can’t tell you how much does or does not get recycled,"" Murray said. ""We have absolutely no way to guarantee or even make the slightest claim that we’re going to hold these for recycling.""

Ideally, he added, residents would know better than to put the bags in their recycling cans and they would never find their way to his facility in the first place.

Rick Winterhalter, chairman of the Oregon Recyclers Association, one of the groups supporting the plastic bags ban, says that’s the general sentiment.

""We kind of look at (plastic bags) like an invasive species,"" he said. ""We have never included them in our curbside recycling program. And yet they wind up in the curbside recycling and then they wind up at the (sorting facility).""

But Winterhalter confirmed what Murray had said, under the right conditions (and if they’re in good enough shape), plastic bags can be recycled. However, he added, the public doesn’t have many options for recycling the bags themselves. ""The opportunities for people to do that in this region are extremely limited.""

Usually those opportunities have to be provided by the grocery stores themselves. For example, Fred Meyer -- which has stopped offering plastic bags in its 10 Portland-area stores -- offers plastic-bag recycling bins at its retail locations. Those recovered bags are then sold to a company that uses the materials in its ""wood alternative"" products.

Other companies, such as Hilex Poly, which manufactures the bags in question, also take the bags back from in-store recycling programs. ""Plastic bags are 100 percent recyclable,"" says Philip Rozenski, the company’s marketing and sustainability director. ""We are one of the major buyers in the United States."" Hilex recycles old bags into new bags.

That said, the company doesn’t offer the sort of dependable buyer that local recycling centers say they need. Hilex works with a specific sort of plastic bag and wrap, and the materials collected at Oregon centers include various other bits and pieces that Hilex has no use for. Rozenski said Hilex would rather educate the public to take the plastic bags back to the stores, rather than get them from sorting centers.

So, it seems, bags can be recycled -- under the right circumstances -- but are they? We gave the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency a call to see if there are any statistics on the matter. It turns out there are. According to the agency’s 2009 Municipal Solid Waste Report, about 3,850,000 tons of ""plastic bags, sacks and wraps were generated"" last year. Of that, 360,000 tons -- about 9 percent -- were recycled. Of the portion of those plastics that are low density -- the sort used in plastic bags -- the recycling rate was closer to 13.4 percent.

In the Feb. 8 hearing, ban opponents tried to argue that plastic bags could be recycled, and Sen. Hass pushed back. He said Oregon recyclers couldn’t use the bags. Well, the issue is not that cut and dried.

In a broader sense, plastic bags are, indeed, recyclable. At the local level, though, it’s a tough sell. Oregon recycling centers can -- and sometimes do -- collect the bags and sell them to others for further recycling. But that’s not always possible; sometimes there’s just no market for the bags, sometimes the bags can’t be saved. (And state recyclers seem to agree that, ultimately, the bags are more trouble than they’re worth",Half True,"March 5, 2011"
"Says broken compact fluorescent light bulbs ""allegedly cause migraines and epilepsy attacks.""","
National conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly, mindful of a federal law that stepped up the required efficiency of light bulbs, recently aired her qualms about the compact fluorescent light bulbs offered to consumers as more efficient alternatives to traditional incandescent bulbs.

In a column included in a Feb. 2 e-mail blast by the Texas Eagle Forum, the founder of the national Eagle Forum said: ""CFL bulbs do not work well in colder temperatures, and most cannot handle dimmer switches; broken CFL bulbs allegedly cause migraines and epilepsy attacks.""

 We’ve previously looked into CFL-related claims, so we know there are variations on this theme. For this article, we’re spotlighting Schlafly’s health claim, that broken CFL bulbs allegedly cause migraines and epilepsy attacks.

Seeking illumination, we requested elaboration from the person who sent the e-mail blast, Pat Carlson, president of the Texas Eagle Forum. Meantime, we found what looked like Schlafly’s original column, posted online Dec. 21 at WorldNetDaily.com. From the site, we also asked Schlafly for back-up information.

Next, we searched online for news stories on CFLs touching off migraines and epileptic episodes. Google led us to an opinion column by Nicolas Loris, a research associate for the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation. In the column, posted online Nov. 10 by the Sacramento Bee, Loris writes: ""Hospitals and medical charities warn that CFL bulbs cause migraines and epilepsy attacks.""

Loris told us by e-mail that his source was a November 2009 article published by a British newspaper, The Daily Mail, which quotes ""medical charities"" saying they have been swamped with complaints that the ""flicker of compact fluorescent bulbs can trigger migraines and epilepsy attacks.""

The article continues: ""The charities are lobbying the (national) government to allow an ‘opt out’ for people with health problems so they can continue to use the older bulbs."" Stating that about one in 10 people suffers from migraines, the article quotes Lee Tomkins, of the Migraine Action Association, recommending that residents stockpile conventional bulbs and advising people who suffer from migraines to avoid using fluorescent bulbs as reading lights, or in living areas and kitchens.

Phew. Who knew?

No one in the United States, it initially appeared.

With help from the American Academy of Neurology, we reached a national expert on each affliction.

Per migraines, Stephen Silberstein, a professor of neurology at the Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, said a light flickering at a certain frequency can aggravate a headache. But, Silberstein said, there is no evidence that CFLs cause migraines. ""This is bull,"" he said.

Marc Nuwer, a professor of clinical neurology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, said strobe lights--such as those in discotheques--can flicker at a rate that would touch off a seizure in about 1 in 200 people. However, Nower said, CFL bulbs flicker at much higher rates not detectable by the human eye; they don’t cause epileptic seizures.

Nuwer speculated: ""Someone is talking about some theoretical far-fetched possibility that a broken light would flash"" at the 10 times per second that can cause seizures among a few. ""Even then, that’s really different from a strobe light, which is really bright, lighting up a room.""

Nuwer said his online searches for scientific literature connecting CFLs to epileptic seizures or migraines came up empty. On our behalf, though, he contacted Graham Harding, an international expert on photo-sensitive epilepsy, a form of the disorder in which seizures are triggered by visual stimuli.

In e-mails to Nuwer, Harding said that among 174 respondents to an online survey by Epilepsy Action, 4 percent -- seven people -- reported epileptic seizures due to CFL bulbs, and 4 percent due to conventional fluorescent lights, compared to less than 1 percent due to conventional incandescent bulbs. Harding’s e-mail says the 4 percent reporting problems with CFLs referred to the lights flashing on start-up or because the bulbs were faulty.

Harding’s e-mail closes: ""So the risk (of induced seizures) is no greater than with normal fluorescent but is more than ordinary filament light bulbs."" All that said, he continued, since conventional bulbs have been phased out, with fluorescents presumably replacing many of them, the United Kingdom’s Epilepsy Action group has not reported any seizure problems to him.

Nuwer also passed along a comment from Robert Fisher, a Stanford University neurologist and director of the Stanford Comprehensive Epilepsy Center. Fisher said by e-mail that fluorescent lights in the United States and Europe flicker at a higher frequency ""than would be likely to provoke photosensitive seizures."" But a ""defective light may flicker at a lower frequency"" and such flickering ""can and has caused seizures in a few susceptible individuals... So it could happen, but it would be expected to be a rare occurrence.""

Next, we interviewed Mark Rea, director of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute’s Lighting Research Center, who said he’s seen no U.S. study demonstrating headaches or epileptic attacks occur because of CFLs. He noted, though, that a 1989 study completed in Great Britain compared the incidence of headaches in an office under different kinds of fluorescent lighting. According to that study, the incidence of eye strain and headaches were cut in half when high-frequency lights were used.

Finally, we came across a paper on CFLs’ impact on health adopted by the European Commission’s Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks in September 2008. The paper says: ""There is no scientific evidence that fluorescent lamps including CFL(s) induce (epileptic) seizures.""

While flickering light in general can induce migraines, the paper says, scientific ""support for aggravating symptoms by flicker from fluorescent tubes was not found."" Similarly, while there’s ""evidence showing that flicker can cause seizures in patients with photosensitive epilepsy,"" the paper says, "" there are no reported effects of CFL having such effects.""

Meanwhile, the Texas Eagle Forum’s Carlson relayed a defense of Schlafly’s statement from Schlafly’s son, John.

Schlafly pointed out that his mother’s use of the word ""allegedly"" signaled that she was ""not claiming she had scientific proof CFLs cause migraines or epilepsy. However, it is a fact that some people who suffer from migraines or epilepsy believe that CFLs cause or aggravate those painful and debilitating conditions, he said.

Our take: Flickering lights of various origins have been linked to migraines and epileptic seizures. But there appears to be no scientific evidence that CFLs, broken or otherwise, cause either disorder",False,"March 5, 2011"
"Says that in a hearing, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords suggested to Gen. David Petraeus that the Army ""put more emphasis on less environmentally damaging methods, like stabbing or clubbing enemy forces in order to minimize the carbon output.""","
A reader recently forwarded us a chain e-mail with a rather striking claim about Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., who is recovering from a brain injury after an assassination attempt in Tucson, Ariz., on Jan. 8, 2011.

A version of it has been posted on a variety of blog sites, including this one. Here are excerpts:

""I had no idea that this Congresswoman was such a nut case.

""It was a tragedy that 19 people were shot and six died. As a result Giffords will be held out as a saint, when in fact, she is an idiot , a left wing ‘enviro-nut’ who should not be in Congress. The media only cares about her because she is a Democrat. Had she been a Republican, like the federal judge who was killed, she would have been off the front page the next day, as he has been.

""I had forgotten she was the Congresswoman that was involved in the following exchange with General Petraeus:

""Poster-child for what is wrong in Washington, DC Our Arizona 8th District US Congressional representative, the Hon. Gabrielle Giffords, in a meeting of the House Armed Services Committee, asked General David Petraeus the following question: ‘General Petraeus, what are you doing to reduce carbon emissions in the war on terror?’ Wow. I had to read, and re-read this several times to believe it. ...

""What Google says about Rep. Giffords: Representative Gabrielle Giffords (D-Az) took Afghan Commander, General David Petraeus, to task for what she characterized as ‘willful disregard of the environmental impact of our war effort.’ ‘There is no policy, no plan to minimize carbon emissions in our military activities,’ Giffords charged. ‘Bombs are dropped and bullets are fired without considering the environmental impact.’ Giffords insisted that she was ‘not demanding an immediate halt to current military operations in the Middle East. I'm just saying that battle plans should include an environmental impact assessment as a regular part of the process before attacks are launched.’

""She also suggested that the Army ‘put more emphasis on less environmentally damaging methods, like stabbing or clubbing enemy forces in order to minimize the carbon output.’""

We found it hard to believe that a member of Congress would actually say that the Army should ""put more emphasis on less environmentally damaging methods, like stabbing or clubbing enemy forces in order to minimize the carbon output."" So we set out to find the source.

Our friends at Snopes.com provided the first clue, noting in a post from July 28, 2010 -- six months before the Tucson shooting -- that a false e-mail had been circulating about Giffords’ alleged questioning of Petraeus.

Snopes.com explained that on June 16, 2010, Petraeus had testified before the House Armed Services Committee and that one of the lawmakers who questioned him was Giffords. She did indeed ask a question that combined elements of environmental and military policy, but the line of inquiry was rather different than what the e-mail suggested.

""There's been a lot of attention back here in the United States on what's happening with the BP oil spill,"" Giffords said at the hearing. ""And as we all know, the largest user of energy on the planet is actually the United States Air Force, and the (Department of Defense) is the largest user of energy in the United States. And I really want to commend the work done on behalf of DOD, and also what's happening in the field with our energy, but it's an area that I just really want to focus on.

""And I know a lot of questions have been asked, but during the last three years, supply lines have increasingly threatened -- have been threatened, either by enemy action or through international places. And in places like Kandahar, where we have a large presence, we have been plugged in to a very unsustainable and really an incapable grid system.

""We know that a major part of the upcoming Kandahar offensive will include some serious repairs and upgrades to the energy system which include small-scale solar and hydropower systems, and also some solar-powered streetlights. I'm just curious whether or not there's plans to utilize any of those same technologies at our bases around Afghanistan, and wouldn't that greatly reduce our need for fuel?""

In other words, Giffords did not ask, ""General Petraeus, what are you doing to reduce carbon emissions in the war on terror?"" -- as the e-mail indicated -- but rather asked him whether the use of alternative energy sources could provide a more reliable and more secure power source for troops located in a faraway, unstable theater of operations, potentially relieving soldiers from having to defend vulnerable supply chains required to move conventional forms of energy.

And that’s where the e-mail checked by Snopes.com ended. The version we received added new claims, including the parts about battlefield environmental impact statements and about Giffords urging American forces to club, rather than shoot, enemy forces.

These comments were also absent from the transcript of the June 16, 2010, hearing. 
But we were able to track down the source: a July 17, 2010, post at the Arizona Conservative blog that was clearly labeled ""Semi-News — A Satirical Look at Recent News.""

Here’s the entire satirical post:

""Army’s ‘Carbon Footprint’ Taints War Effort

""Representative Gabrielle Giffords (D-Az) took Afghan Commander, General David Petraeus, to task for what she characterized as ‘willful disregard of the environmental impact of our war effort.’

""‘There is no policy, no plan to minimize carbon emissions in our military activities,’ Giffords charged. ‘Bombs are dropped and bullets are fired without considering the environmental impact.’

""Giffords insisted that she was ‘not demanding an immediate halt to current military operations in the Middle East. I’m just saying that battle plans should include an environmental impact assessment as a regular part of the process before attacks are launched.’

""She also suggested that the Army ‘put more emphasis on less environmentally damaging methods, like stabbing or clubbing enemy forces in order to minimize the carbon output.’""

In other words, the chain e-mailer cut and pasted the satirical post -- but, whether intentionally or accidentally, left out the crucial label ""satirical.""

We reached out to two people who have posted or forwarded the item but did not hear back.

So where does this leave us? In the hearing, Giffords did indeed raise an issue involving alternative energy with Petraeus, but it was not to express a concern that the military should ""reduce carbon emissions in the war on terror"" -- rather, it was to improve energy reliability and security for American forces on the ground. And the claims that Giffords urged American forces to club, rather than shoot, the enemy in order to reduce carbon emissions were pure satire but not labeled as such by the chain e-mailer. All told, the claims in the chain e-mail are ridiculous",False Pants on Fire,"March 1, 2011"
"""Twelve percent of the garbage collected in those SOLV cleanups, by volume, is plastic bags.""","
The pitched battle over Oregon’s proposed plastic bag  ban -- and accompanying 5-cent charge on paper bags -- is ripe for misused and invented facts, figures and claims. Already, we’ve knocked down one assertion that the ban would install a tax on paper bags.

Well, during a Feb. 8 hearing, Beaverton Democrat Sen. Mark Hass -- one of the biggest cheerleaders for the ban -- made a few of his own assertions that had us doing double-takes. One of them was that ""12 percent of the garbage collected in those SOLV cleanups, by volume, is plastic bags.""

SOLV, for the uninitiated, is a statewide conservation nonprofit. In addition to other efforts, the group organizes river and beach cleanups throughout the year.

We went to SOLV’s website to see what we could dig up. We couldn’t find much in the way of overall numbers, but we did find a breakdown of the sort of trash the group’s volunteers had collected during their Fall Beach and Riverside Clean-up.

Among the detritus were cigarette filters, plastic bottles, caps, cans, food wrappers, rope, straws and -- yes -- plastic bags. All told, 5,851 pieces of litter were found at the group’s 19 beach and two river cleanup sites.

How much, then, did plastic bags account for? The breakdown didn’t give any sense of relative volume, though, so we could check only by percentage. By our math, 4 percent, given 245 bags were collected. That’s quite a ways away from Sen. Hass’ 12 percent figure.

Next, we called SOLV and spoke with Rachel Pecore, a program coordinator there, and we asked if there were any more-comprehensive numbers about the debris SOLV has found over the years -- a number that included more than just the previous fall’s cleanup. She said she wasn’t aware of any, but she cautioned us about putting too much stock in the composition breakdown on the group’s website.

As it turns out, some 7,000 volunteers participated in the fall cleanup, but only 232 of those volunteers actually participated in filling out data cards on the debris they collected. ""Volunteers have an option of completing a data card of what they picked up,"" Pecore said. ""It is not a scientifically rigorous process. They’re estimates.""

Pecore then pointed us in the direction of the Ocean Conservancy, a far-reaching conservation group that keeps better numbers. In fact, she said, SOLV gets the data cards from the group and reports its findings back.

We looked at Ocean Conservancy’s 2010 study of marine debris, ""Trash Travels."" According to that report, about a half-million volunteers participated in a worldwide cleanup that covered 108 countries and 45 states. All told, volunteers reported some 10,240,000 pieces of debris, of which 1,126,774 piece were plastic bags -- roughly 11 percent.

As for Oregon specifically, the group found that of the 6,881 pieces of debris collected in the state, 890 bits were plastic bags. That’s about 13 percent.

We’d yet to find the 12 percent figure Hass had referred to at the hearing, so we gave his office a call. The senator told us a SOLV program coordinator had given him the 12 percent figure. He said he’d follow up in an e-mail, and, true to his word, he did.

Hass forwarded us -- along with a few other bits and pieces -- an e-mail he received from Diana Bartlett, a SOLV program coordinator. In the e-mail she notes that the Ocean Conservancy’s 2009 marine debris report shows that 12 percent of the trash collected by volunteers was made up of plastic bags. We checked the report and she’s right.

Hass also noted that the 2009 report offers a state-by-state breakdown that says cleaners found 13.4 percent of their sample in Oregon was plastic bags (172 of the 1,281 pieces collected).

Hass ended his e-mail with this: ""I’m happy to defend anything I’ve said on this issue -- and take my lumps if it’s out of context or outdated.""

So, are there any lumps to give? In the Feb. 8 committee hearing Hass said. ""Twelve percent of the garbage collected in those SOLV cleanups, by volume, is plastic bags.""

None of the sources gave a sense of relative volume. One discarded sofa (yes, SOLV volunteers found a brown plaid sofa on the beach one year) is more volume than 172 plastic bags.

And Hass wasn’t exactly right. He cited SOLV’s cleanups but the organization doesn’t gather reliable numbers. Ocean Conservancy, the group that actually produced the figure Hass used, did report that plastic bags made up 12 percent of its marine debris collection in 2008 and 11 percent in 2009. That percentage jumped to 13.4 percent in 2008 and 13 percent in 2009 when Oregon was considered alone, according to Ocean Conservancy reports.

It seems to us that Hass attributed his 12 percent figure to the wrong source. That said, the 12 percent figure seems to jibe with the general range the two most recent reports offer",Mostly True,"February 26, 2011"
"Four state Assembly Democrats ""scored a death blow to northeast Wisconsin’s economy"" by killing hundreds of jobs at a potential Bass Pro Shops near Green Bay.","
The potent combination of the Green Bay Packers, jobs and the great outdoors formed a fine kettle of fish in Madison.

The Journal Sentinel revealed Jan. 13, 2011, that outdoors retailer Bass Pro Shops was part of a development that businessman John Bergstrom was planning for a small piece of land near Lambeau Field in Green Bay.

That proposal, however, was hung up because part of the site had been designated a wetland. Environmental groups had raised objections, prompting an administrative review that could tack months onto the process.

As the Jan. 13 story noted, Gov. Scott Walker stepped in and had drafted an unusually specific piece of legislation that exempted the parcel from the environmental review.

As a vote neared, four Democratic members of the state Assembly sent a letter Jan. 26, 2011, to Bass Pro Shops founder Johnny Morris asking for a compromise on the project that would protect wetlands and the state’s fish population.

Two days later, Bass Pro Shops issued a short statement that said the company does not build stores on wetlands. A spokesman said the chain had held discussions with Bergstrom but said there was no deal.

All pretty straightforward.

Later that afternoon, Rep. Scott Suder (R-Abbotsford) let fly with two statements on the topic -- a news release and an e-mail blast.

The headline on the news release said ""Dems Kill Hundreds of Jobs in NE Wisconsin."" The release went on to say: ""Liberal Democrats in Madison scored a death blow to northeast Wisconsin's economy by winning a battle for the far left agenda.""

That gives a lot of credit to the out-of-power Democrats, who were using the old tactic of writing a letter -- and releasing it to the media -- to gain attention.

So, did the letter from the Dems scare off a national retail chain with 50 stores in 26 states?

We asked Suder for evidence that the company had made its decision -- essentially overnight -- in response to the letter.

""Certainly, the letter that was sent caused Bass Pro Shops to hesitate,"" Suder said, though he acknowledged he had no contact with the retailer about the matter.

Let’s fish out some details on the project: 
The author of the letter was state Rep. Brett Hulsey (D-Madison). He said he had met Morris -- the Bass Pro Shops founder -- years ago, when Hulsey worked for the Clinton administration.

""I could not imagine Johnny Morris and Bass Pro building on a wetlands because of the company’s core conservation principles,"" said Hulsey.

He said a Bass Pro Shops executive called him the day after the letter was sent and said the company was interested in Wisconsin but did not build on wetlands.

Despite the company’s position, the Legislature passed the bill exempting the parcel from the water quality review and Walker signed it Feb. 3, 2011.

Walker said that in the past the ""bureaucracy got in the way"" and his administration wanted to send the message: ""You can conserve and protect wetlands while having an economic project move forward.""

However, some believe the action will make the location less desirable, at least from a public relations point of view.

Said Hulsey: ""It’s been contaminated by this bill.""

Indeed, the fact wetlands were an issue may have had a special impact with Bass Pro Shops, which has no Wisconsin locations.

""For an outdoor retailer, that’s a more sensitive subject than for another one,"" said Neil Stern, senior partner with McMillan Doolittle, a company that advises retailers. His firm previously worked for Cabela’s, a Bass Pro Shops competitor.

""They want an arm’s length from any controversy,"" he said of Bass Pro Shops.

In its statement, Bass Pro Shops noted the company ""has a long and proud tradition of our conservation efforts and is a very conservation minded company. We have been recognized many times by conservation organizations across America for those conservation efforts. We were unaware of any wetlands issues and have not and will not be in favor of doing anything to harm wetlands wherever they might be.""

Let’s return to Suder’s statement, which said the letter by the Democrats torpedoed hundreds of jobs and was the death knell for the region’s economy.

That’s a huge overreach.

Had the store opened it would have created about 300 retail jobs. State records show that the Green Bay area in December had about 161,000 jobs. And the region is a much broader area than that.

OK, let’s pull this fish into the boat and see what we’ve got.

Suder charges that by sending a letter to Bass Pro Shops, four Democrats killed the project -- and with it, hundreds of jobs in Green Bay, dealing ""a death blow to northeast Wisconsin’s economy."" That’s one heck of a poison pen.

But there was no agreement between the developer and Bass Pro Shops and the wetlands objections had been raised by DNR staffers and environmentalists long before the Democratic lawmakers weighed in. Indeed, Walker and the Legislature were already moving to address the concerns about the wetlands issue slowing the project even before the letter. What’s more, the number of jobs in question -- welcome as they would be -- certainly doesn’t rate as a death blow to an entire region’s economy.

A 5-cent charge on paper bags is a tax.,"
Opponents have raised a number of arguments to make their case against Senate Bill 536, which would ban plastic shopping bags and require retailers to charge a nickel per paper bag: It’s the elimination of choice at the checkout. It’s based on lies by the environmental community. And yes -- they went there -- it’s a tax on sacks.

At a public hearing, Mark Daniels, a vice president from Hilex Poly Co., said the proposal would force consumers to ""pay a tax on paper bags."" To that, bag-ban champion Sen. Mark Hass, D-Beaverton, jumped in and said the nickel charge is not a tax, and pointed to a Legislative Counsel opinion showing so. The next day, the Taxpayer Association of Oregon, which is opposed to the bag ban, accused Hass of trying to censor speech.

So, we wanted to know, is a nickel charge on a paper bag a tax? Is it a de-facto tax?

A tax has a very specific definition in Oregon government. It’s so specific that the state constitution calls for a higher number of votes-- three-fifths of each chamber -- to pass a tax than to pass a fee, which only requires a simple majority. Voters approved the change in May 1996, embedding the provision into the Oregon Constitution. In any case, to be a tax, it must raise revenue for the general treasury.

Former legislative counsel Greg Chaimov agrees with the current Legislative Counsel opinion that the nickel provision is neither a tax nor a fee. ""It’s whatever the grocers want to call it. For constitutional purposes, a fee or a tax is at issue only if it is bringing money into the government.""

Dexter Johnson, the current legislative counsel, said the bag charge would be most similar to the bottle bill deposit, also known as the ""container deposit law."" In Oregon and in other states, you have to pay a nickel extra for beer, soft drinks and bottled water; that money stays with distributors unless you return the bottle to the grocer for your nickel.

And here’s another charge that doesn’t count as a tax or a fee. In 1999, state lawmakers ordered utility companies to assess a ""public purpose charge"" on electricity and gas bills. Much of the money goes to the nonprofit Energy Trust of Oregon, with some proceeds going to weatherize schools and low-income homes. Again, it doesn’t ""raise revenue"" because the money doesn’t go into state coffers -- even if the government dictates how the money should be spent.

Back to the bag charge. The state doesn’t get any of that money. Grocers can spend the money however they want. And shoppers -- and this is critical -- don’t need to pay a nickel for a paper bag. They are free to bring in their own carrying devices, from gym bags to multi-use plastic bags to previously used paper bags. There is no constitutional right to a disposable sack.

Anna Richter Taylor, a lobbyist representing Hilex, argues that for Oregonians who have never before had to pay for a supermarket bag, this is a tax. ""The Legislature can call it what they want, but government -- and not grocers -- is forcing consumers to buy a reusable bag or a paper bag,"" she said.

PolitiFact Oregon doesn’t like paying for something that once was free. But remember, television used to be free. Bottled drinks were once 5 cents cheaper. Utility companies used to not charge 3 percent extra for energy programs. Frankly, we think it’s easier to avoid the 5 cent charge on bags than it is to bypass bottled drinks or the public purpose charge on utility bills",False,"February 13, 2011"
"Says an EPA permit ""languished"" under Strickland but his new EPA director got it done in two days.","
Gov. John Kasich wanted to make a splash.

The swashbuckling Ohio governor wanted to show Ohio’s business community he was serious about his vow to speed up the permitting process at the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.

Kasich found just such an opportunity when an air pollution permit for an Eastern Ohio energy company, Mingo Junction Energy Center (MJEC), was granted during his first week in office.

At a news conference on his fifth day in office, the Republican governor described the air permit as having ""languished"" under the previous administration and was incredulous that EPA officials had ""held the darn thing up for over 20 months.""

Kasich implied that EPA paper-pushers had been negligent. ""It’s just bureaucracy. It’s a lack of commitment and a lack of vision.""

Kasich praised his new EPA director, Scott Nally, for acting quickly to get the permit issued. ""This is a fact — it was over 20 months they couldn’t get an agreement, he did it in 48 hours,"" Kasich boasted.

PolitiFact Ohio found that claim startling — and just the kind of thing to assess.

We contacted Chris Abbruzzese, the EPA’s director of communications, who said the governor’s characterization was accurate because no agreement had been reached under former Gov. Ted Strickland and in a ""48-hour window"" Nally had managed to work out a deal. He did note that the Strickland administration spent 19 months on the permit, rather than 20, as the governor said.

Abbruzzese said Nally asked Bob Hodanbosi, chief of the Division of Air Pollution Control, top permit writer Mike Hopkins and other staffers to tackle 27 technical issues that remained on the permit request. They whittled that down to just a pair of issues by the close of the business day on Jan 12.

During an hour-long call on the morning of Jan 13, Nally, Hodanbosi, Hopkins and the company’s lawyer Ken Komoroski were able to sort out those last two issues. All that was left that night was for staff attorneys for each side to ""trade documents and get the final language in place,"" according to Abbruzzese.

Next, we looked at what was accomplished on the project under Strickland. An internal memo from Hodanbosi to Nally on Jan. 12  told us that a draft permit was issued in November 2010 following more than 35 weekly conference calls and meetings with the company. The discussions and joint development of the permit by EPA staff and the company concerned exactly how to allow the company to burn coke-oven gas from a steel-making process instead of ""flaring it off"" into the atmosphere.

After receiving comments from the company during the 30-day draft period that lasted until mid-December 2010, the EPA ""revised the final permit twice to try and address their concerns and was ready to issue the final permit"" during Strickland’s last week in office, Hodanbosi wrote.

But the company balked at some of the language in the permit, so it wasn’t issued while Strickland was in office. ""The company responded on Jan. 7, 2011, that they did not want the permit issued as written,"" reads the memo.

Chris Korleski, who preceded Nally as head of the state EPA under Strickland,  said the project was ""almost finished"" and required only a few tweaks.

""The vast bulk of a tremendous amount of work was done already when I left,"" Korleski. The former director said that Kasich had unfairly portrayed his team as indifferent bureaucrats.

""This was not a poster child for anything wrong that Ohio EPA did,"" Korleski said. ""The staff bent over backwards to the point of rushing two sets of orders allowing them to keep operating in the absence of the permit.""

He added: ""They got it worked out on a phone call in an hour? That tells me the issues weren’t terribly complex or terribly difficult.""

Bob Smith, a Maryland attorney and partner with Venable LLP who has three decades of experience working on air pollution permits including some for steel plants and co-generation facilities, had a similar view.

Speaking in general terms, Smith said typically you are ""very close"" to issuing the final permit once the draft permit has been issued, particularly when there aren't any comments (as was the case here) from the public or outside parties to consider.

Smith said having the permit applicant request changes of a draft permit is pretty standard.
""Those kinds of requests are not at all uncommon,"" he said. ""It can take agency personnel a bit of time to digest them,"" he said. He said normally it would take a few weeks or a month to wrap up the process.

Any changes during a final 48-hour period would be ""last-minute fine-tuning to make sure the permit was appropriately clear,"" he said. ""It's a process that only happens at the end of a very long process. A longer time period (than 48 hours) would have been required to deal with the bigger issues.""

So to sum up, there is a sliver of truth to what Kasich said, as more than 19 months had elapsed with no final agreement in place. And the finishing touches to the permit were clearly put on the project by staff being pushed by Nally in the two-day time frame.  

But, given the work that was done during those 19 months, and that the company was the roadblock to the permit being completed while Strickland was still governor, Kasich’s complaint of a ""lack of commitment"" from staffers as the reason for the project taking so long doesn’t ring true.

And, Kasich’s contention at the news conference that ""they couldn’t get an agreement"" for 20 months that Nally got in 48 hours is an oversimplification, particularly since a draft permit was issued in mid-November, and state officials were ready to issue a final permit while Strickland was still in office.

Those are critical facts that would give the listener a different impression of the governor’s statement",True,"February 7, 2011"
"Says the Texas Forest Service planted 6,000 trees in the Dallas/Fort Worth area before the Super Bowl for unknown reasons at an unknown cost.","
Super Bowls often have off-the-field twists.

On Feb. 3, conservative activist Michael Quinn Sullivan of Austin arched his brow about preparations for Super Bowl XLV, set for Sunday in Cowboys Stadium, writing in a Twitter post: ""Your Texas Forest Service planted 6,000 trees in (Dallas/Fort Worth) area in advance of Super Bowl. Cost? Unknown. Why? Same. ""

Asked to elaborate, Sullivan replied via Twitter that he’d learned of the trees from a Capitol newsletter, Texas Insider. Its Feb. 3 edition includes an item stating the forest service plans to help the bowl go smoothly by mobilizing an incident management team. It closes: ""In addition, the agency prepared for the coming deluge of tourists by planting more than 6,000 trees in Arlington and surrounding cities.""

Really?

By e-mail, a service spokeswoman, April Saginor, told us the agency put $50,000 toward planting trees in a dozen North Texas host cities, which we later identified as Addison, Arlington, Dallas, Denton, Farmers Branch, Fort Worth, Frisco, Grapevine, Irving, Lewisville, Plano and Richardson. The idea, Saginor said, was to partner with the NFL, the Texas Trees Foundation and other agencies ""to lessen environmental impacts of hosting the Super Bowl and improve the environment and quality of life in the area.""

A service press release quotes Jack Groh, director of the NFL’s environmental program, saying his agency has been facilitating environmental projects for Super Bowl host cities for 17 years. ""This was the most extensive urban forestry project ever in the history"" of such Super Bowl projects, Groh said. ""This had more of a reach and more of an impact than we’ve ever had.""

In interviews, Groh and Janette Monear, executive director of the Dallas-rooted trees foundation, told us more than 6,500 trees were planted this past year in public spaces and near schools. Monear said the forest service’s $50,000 grant, consisting of federal aid, was matched by private donations gathered by the foundation.

Groh told  us the trees ""actually do something for the local climate, whether it’s reducing pollution"" by absorbing carbon dioxide ""or lowering the temperature a little bit with shade.""

Given how quickly we were able to track down such details, we wondered if the tree project was ""unknown"" to denizens of the host cities.

Democratic activist Phillip Martin of Austin, who poked at Sullivan’s Twitter message the night it launched, guided us to a Jan. 13 Fort Worth Star-Telegram news article previewing an Arlington luncheon, emceed by Cowboys’ great Drew Pearson, celebrating the plantings.

And on Jan. 21, our online search showed, the Dallas Morning News published a news article quoting Groh and Arlington Mayor Richard Cluck, who said: ""There are so many advantages to having the Super Bowl in your town ... and one of the big ones is the environmental program. There’s nothing more important to me, and it should be to you, to grow our tree population.""

The Dallas newspaper said in a Jan. 28 news article that the tree plantings are expected to touch off other planting programs. The story says the foundation ""already has a deal with the city of Richardson to plant 50,000 trees, and this spring, the group will launch an initiative to put 3 million trees in North Texas soil.""

The story quotes Monear as saying: ""It’s a legacy project. This growth is going to benefit the region for many years.""

So, 6,000 trees planted, as Sullivan says? That’s about right.

At an unknown cost? For an unknown purpose? Not so, times two. Besides, ""your Forest Service,"" as Sullivan puts it, didn’t plant the trees by its lonesome. Moreover, half the expenses were covered by private donations",Half True,"February 6, 2011"
"Nevada will be ""energy independent within the immediate future.""","
In a recent TV interview, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid made a striking claim about his home state. Reid said Nevada will be ""energy independent within the immediate future.""

During the Jan. 18, 2011, interview, Nevada political journalist Jon Ralston asked Reid how soon Nevada can start exporting its energy to other states.

""It’s going to take a while, but some of that is happening right now,"" Reid said, citing a power line between northern and southern Nevada that’s in the works.

""California has a rule that one-third of all their electricity by the year 2020 must come from renewable sources,"" Reid said. ""They simply can’t do it. So we will be the chief state that they will import their energy from.""

Ralston prodded, ""How long is it going to take to get that to happen?""

""I would say within the next three or four years,"" Reid responded.

""That fast?"" Ralston asked.

""Oh yeah, we are going to be able to be energy independent within the immediate future,"" Reid said.

We decided to see if the senator was correct.

We began by contacting the Nevada State Office of Energy, which keep statistics on the state's energy sources, but Spokesman Sean Sever said his agency ""doesn't have anything to prove or disprove this statement.""

So we turned to Scot Rutledge, the executive director of the Nevada Conservation League and Education Fund, a leading environmental group in the state. Rutledge was skeptical.

He said that Nevada could stop importing coal by shutting down a few plants in northern Nevada, and the state does have enough geothermal resources to theoretically replace fossil-fuel powered plants, particularly natural gas. ""But that would take longer than three to four years,"" he said.

In the meantime, Nevada does have impressive solar resources, and if the state developed sufficient storage capacity, that might be enough to provide 24-hour electricity for homes and businesses.

But being a net exporter of energy does not necessarily mean being ""energy independent."" That’s because cars, trucks and airplanes have to run on fuel, too -- and the state does not have enough oil for that.

""We would need to convert every vehicle on the road to electric,"" Rutledge said, and then provide fuel obtained in-state for airplanes.

All told, Rutledge said, it’s conceivable that Nevada might be able to export more energy than it imports ""over the next seven to 10 years, but I don't think that is a true definition of energy independence.""

Rutledge speculated that Reid may simply have been overzealous in echoing comments from 2008 by former President Bill Clinton. Clinton told a national clean-energy summit-- held in Nevada and co-sponsored by Reid -- that the state could one day become energy independent, as could such countries as Liberia, Rwanda, East Timor and Papua New Guinea.

At the same summit, Reid said in a speech that ""the sun shines here all the time. The wind blows much of the time, and we're one of the few states that has massive amounts of geothermal energy. That's why I refer to Nevada as the Saudi Arabia of renewable energy. Tax incentives and upgraded transmission capacity could make the goals set forth for Nevada a reality.""

Indeed, when we contacted Reid’s office, spokesman Jon Summers repeated the theme of Nevada as a huge repository of untapped energy.

Reid ""has a vision of Nevada leading the nation in clean energy production,"" Summers said. ""He’s been responsible for hundreds of millions of dollars in investment in the state’s clean energy industry. Nevada’s north-to-south transmission line, which is expected to be completed in less than three years, will allow the state’s population centers to secure clean energy from rural areas and even export it outside the state. In his interview, Sen. Reid said he thinks that energy independence is going to take a while but some of it is already happening.""

We’ll grant that in the interview, the discussion began with the question of how fast Nevada can begin exporting energy out of the state. But Reid went on to say the state would be ""energy independent within the immediate future,"" which means all of the state’s energy would be produced within its own boundaries. Even if Nevada successfully taps into its solar and other energy resources, it is many years away from changing all of its cars, trucks and planes from fossil fuels to fuels that can be produced within the state",False,"February 3, 2011"
"""[Tailpipe emissions rules], if fully implemented with all the regulations that go with it, they will keep the temperature from rising nearly five one-hundredths of a degree Fahrenheit. By 2050.""","During a recent speech at a Tea Party rally, Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli took plenty of shots at the Environmental Protection Agency.

The Republican, an unabashed critic of global warming claims, called the EPA  ""the Employment Prevention Agency.""

While discussing the EPA’s endangerment finding that greenhouse gasses ""threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations,"" Cuccinelli voiced contempt for new regulations that will limit tailpipe emissions.

""It turns out that they believe, that if fully implemented with all the regulations that go with it, they will keep the temperature from rising nearly five one-hundredths of a degree Fahrenheit. By 2050.""

As the crowd laughed and jeered, the attorney general added, ""I might not be able to see my breath by then.""

Only 0.05 degrees by 2050? Is that really what the EPA was claiming these rules would do?

Brian Gottstein, Cuccinelli’s director of communications, referred us to the EPA’s massive document on light-duty vehicle greenhouse gas emission standards. He pointed us to page 4-101, deep in the document. It said: ""EPA modeled the anticipated potential effect on climate change and found that in year 2100, the rule would reduce temperature increases by 0.006-0.015 degrees Celsius.""

Those Celsius figures translate to a range from 0.011 to 0.027 degrees Fahrenheit.

Cuccinelli had claimed there would be a 0.05 reduction in temperature increases by 2050. So he actually spoke in the EPA’s favor, overstating the expected reduction and saying it would happen 50 years faster than the agency claims.

We also called the EPA and asked them to quantify any temperature reductions that could be expected under the new rules, which affect cars in model years 2012 through 2016. Spokeswoman Enesta Jones e-mailed us a response.

""EPA estimated that the 2012-2016 light duty tailpipe standards would reduce the global mean temperature by 0.006 to 0.015 °C by 2100. The approach used to estimate changes in global mean temperature evaluates the impact of the rule’s emissions reductions in the context of global [greenhouse gas] emissions,"" she wrote. ""Although the projected reductions are small in overall magnitude by themselves, they are quantifiable and would contribute to reducing climate change risks.""

The new EPA limits would establish in 2012 model cars the first-ever caps on carbon dioxide emissions by cars and light trucks. Over the next five years the limits would toughen by about 14 percent. The rules would also push fuel efficiency from 33.8 miles per gallon for passenger cars in the 2012 model year up to 39.5 miles per gallon in 2016.

The agency says these new rules would add about $950 to the price of each new car but that the higher price would be offset by lower fuel costs over three to five years.

Let’s review. The Virginia attorney general said the EPA’s new tailpipe emissions rules for cars and other light-duty vehicles would reduce temperature increases by 0.05 degrees Fahrenheit. He said this would occur by 2050.

The EPA said the reductions would be between 0.011 degrees Fahrenheit and 0.027 degrees Fahrenheit and would occur by 2100. The agency’s claim is even more modest than Cuccinelli suggested.

Speaking without notes at a cold outdoor rally, the attorney general came pretty close to hitting the actual EPA claim, and he actually erred in the agency’s favor by overstating the size of projected reductions. He also missed the date, but again erred in the EPA’s favor",True,"January 28, 2011"
Says required state septic inspections would cost septic tank owners $100 to $150 every five years.,"
Members of the state Legislature who resoundingly voted in 2010 to require people to have their septic tanks inspected once every five years now say the new law -- sorry for the pun -- stinks.

The idea, to help prevent sewage from leaking out of septic tanks and into the state groundwater system, isn't the problem, they say. It's the cost to septic tank owners that worries legislators. They agreed in November to push back the implementation of the bill from Jan. 1, 2011, until July 1, 2011, to delay any fiscal impact on septic tank owners.

And now, the entire proposal appears to be -- okay, last pun -- circling the drain.

A Senate committee debated reversing many of the requirements on Jan. 26, 2011, less than a year after the initial legislation passed. State Sen. Charlie Dean, R-Inverness, who voted for the inspection requirement but is now leading a fight to have it removed or replaced, said the law has been met with almost ""unanimous disapproval,"" and that many septic tank owners are not in areas where they would affect water quality, anyway.

Sen. Nancy Detert, R-Venice, another 'Yes' vote in 2010, said the requirement is unnecessary. If someone's septic tank breaks, they'll have it fixed, she said. ""The previous incarnation of this legislation started out to protect the springs,"" Detert said. ""It became a huge overreach and overrun.""

But Sen. Dennis Jones, R-Treasure Island, said he saw merits in the law (which he voted for, too, by the way).

The inspection will help keep sewage from entering the state water system. It will keep homeowners' septic tanks in better shape. And it can serve a public good.

On top of all that, Jones said, the cost is marginal.

""I don't think it's that expensive to spend $100 to $150 every five years,"" he said.

Does all this talk and concern really boil down to $30 a year? PolitiFact Florida decided to find out.

Septic tanks largely unchecked

The septic tank inspection requirement seemed to be controversial from the moment it was approved and signed into law on June 4, 2010, by then-Gov. Charlie Crist.

According to the Department of Health, there are more than 2.6 million septic sewage systems in Florida serving about a third of the state's population. But less than 1 percent of the state's systems -- about 17,000 -- are being inspected and serviced by licensed maintenance professionals. In most cases, septic systems are only checked or serviced when they fail. And more than half of the state's septic systems are at least 30 years old.

Leaky septic tanks have been identified by health and environmental officials as major sources of water pollution.

So a group of legislators worked for several years to try to force inspections. The law that finally passed in 2010 attempted to mute concerns over cost. It requires inspections every five years (the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency suggests an inspection every three to five years), creates a grant program for low-income homeowners and allows certain homeowners to request a one-time, one-year inspection extension.

""Pay a little bit now or all of us will pay a whole lot later,"" said former state Sen. Lee Constantine, R-Altamonte Springs, who was behind the 2010 law.

But concerns over the cost to homeowners quickly escalated. The Legislature passed a measure to stall implementation of the law during a November special session, and then waited until Gov. Rick Scott took office to send the bill to the governor's office to prevent a possible veto from Crist. Scott allowed the delay to become law without his signature.

""I applaud Governor Scott for allowing Senate Bill 2A to become law,"" Senate Majority Leader Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando, who voted for the original 2010 law, said in a statement. ""This decisive step postpones the implementation of septic tank inspection regulations, enabling lawmakers to analyze whether or not such a mandate is necessary and saving taxpayer dollars in the meantime.""

Interestingly, a state Senate analysis found that the inspection requirement would create hundreds ""if not thousands"" of private sector jobs because of a shortage of certified septic tank inspectors. The Department of Health estimated that annual septic tank inspections would grow from 17,000 a year to 500,000.

The cost of an inspection

All this leads to the main point of this fact check -- just how much would an inspection cost?

Jones said the cost of the inspection is between $100 and $150, to be paid once every five years. But we found references to the inspection costing $500. And then other references to $200.

In an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Jones said he used information from the Department of Health for his estimate. But he believed the number might even be high. He said he spoke with people who believe that an influx of new private inspectors will naturally drive down costs because of increased competition.

Michelle Dahnke, a health department spokeswoman, said private contractors would do the inspections. The department estimated an inspection would cost $150, she said, but that contractors ultimately would set the price and compete for business.

We then asked two private-sector experts to talk about the cost of an inspection.

Ellen Vause, president of Florida Septic Inc. in Hawthorne, said the cost of the inspection will depend on what the state actually requires and where the septic tank is located. Vause said that a standard inspection, which would include pumping out sewage from a septic tank system, costs $150 to $300 now in North Florida, and $200 to $350 in South Florida. The main difference, Vause said, is the cost to dispose of the sludge.

But Vause said she would expect costs to drop if more inspections were required because contractors could do several inspections in the same neighborhood on the same day, saving on transportation and disposal costs.

Bob Himschoot, a member of the Florida Onsite Wastewater Association and an owner of a septic tank contracting company in Fort Myers, pegged the cost slightly higher -- between $325 and $500. The cost includes the labor cost of a technician, who must be qualified to drive a commercial vacuum truck, equipment cost and the cost to dispose of the waste.

The cost of the inspection is only one part of the problem, though. The worry is that the inspector finds something wrong.

It's like going to the car mechanic for an oil change. You find out your brakes need fixing. Your wheels are out of alignment. Your tires are wearing thin. (And dollar signs dance through your head.)

That's exactly the point of the 2010 law, of course, to identify problems to keep contaminants from seeping into the ground. The Department of Health, in draft rules, would require septic tank owners to repair tanks that are cracked and replace systems where sewage is flowing directly into the ground.

Should your system need to replaced entirely -- systems generally last between 20 and 30 years -- that will cost $5,000 to $7,500 on average.

""It's just another thing for the government to get mixed up with when they have no business sticking their nose in there,"" said Ralph Pohl, 77, who installed a septic tank 18 years ago at his home in Seacrest in the Panhandle and hasn't had it inspected once. Pohl reports no problems with his system.

""I have no problem with someone coming and taking a look if there's any seepage or things like that,"" he said. ""To force an inspector to come out and dig out a perfectly operating septic tank -- I don't see the point. If they're working, there's no problem. If they're not working, the homeowner is going to have to do something.""

There's another obvious, but critical point to consider when talking about the cost of a septic tank inspection. People using septic tanks don't pay for a central sewer system. People without septic tanks do. We did some math for three areas -- St. Petersburg in Pinellas County, Lakeland in Polk County, and the residents of Marion County -- and found that the typical sewer system customer will pay $375-$400 a year for sewer service in those three areas. Septic tank users would pay nothing.

Over five years, that's $1,875-$2,000 in sewer charges versus nothing.

""It's really a very inexpensive method compared to a central sewer system,"" Himschoot said.

Our ruling

In talking about making changes to a law requiring septic tank inspections once every five years, Sens. Dean and Detert didn't question the need to have properly functioning septic tanks but argued that the inspection itself was unnecessary for many people. Jones countered that the cost of the inspection alone isn't that great, especially when spread out over five years.

Jones said an inspection would cost $100 to $150, citing a Department of Health estimate. Spread over five years, that's an investment of as little as $30 a year -- much less than homeowners with a central sewer system pay.

But that's not telling the entire story. Experts we talked to said the price of an inspection could cost up to $500 and depends on a number of variables. On top of that, the inspection could result in finding problems that could require repairs at additional cost. That's obviously part of the intent of the bill, but it comes at a cost nevertheless",Half True,"January 27, 2011"
"""The Interior Department is in charge of salmon while they're in fresh water, but the Commerce Department handles them when they're in saltwater.""","
One of President Barack Obama's big laugh lines from his State of the Union address came when he talked about fish: salmon, to be specific. Obama's set-up was a call for efficient government.

""We shouldn't just give our people a government that's more affordable. We should give them a government that's more competent and more efficient. We can't win the future with a government of the past,"" Obama said. ""We live and do business in the Information Age, but the last major reorganization of the government happened in the age of black-and-white TV. There are 12 different agencies that deal with exports. There are at least five different agencies that deal with housing policy. Then there's my favorite example: The Interior Department is in charge of salmon while they're in freshwater, but the Commerce Department handles them when they're in saltwater. I hear it gets even more complicated once they're smoked.""

We didn't much doubt the example. (We'll note again that White House speech writers have weeks to research and write the address.) But it did make us curious. So we decided to check the facts behind salmon swimming across regulatory lines.

And swim they do: Most salmon are born in rivers and streams, then swim out to the ocean to become adults. Once they're full-grown, they return to the rivers and streams to breed. The technical term for this is ""anadromous.""

When fish are out in the ocean, they're regulated by the National Marine Fisheries Service, which ""predicts the status of fish stocks, ensures compliance with fisheries regulations and works to reduce wasteful fishing practices,"" according to its website. The service is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which is, as Obama said, part of the U.S. Commerce Department.

When fish are in the rivers and streams, they're regulated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which focuses on the conservation and protection of fish and wildlife and their habitats. The Fish and Wildlife Service is indeed part of the Department of Interior.

When the fish is smoked, it would generally be regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which regulates most packaged foods.

Obama might even have been underselling the complexity. A major effort in the Pacific Northwest to protect and conserve salmon in the Columbia River Basin involves a ""federal caucus"" of 10 agencies working together for that purpose, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Geological Survey, to name a few.

And while the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service claims jurisdiction over salmon, freshwater fishing is also regulated heavily by state agencies.

""It is a stretch to say that salmon in freshwater are regulated by the Interior Department,"" said Ray Hilborn, a professor at the University of Washington's School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences. ""Harvest in freshwater is almost totally regulated by states, and in some case tribes,"" he said in an e-mail. ""In salt water the ocean harvest beyond 3 miles is federally regulated, but almost all the catch in the U.S. takes place in Alaska, and the state of Alaska regulates that fishery.""

""In reality, most of the things that affect salmon in freshwater are managed by dozens of agencies,"" he added.

A conservationist we spoke with said that more agencies doesn't necessarily mean more inefficiency. ""It can cut both ways. In a good sense, it can bring more resources,"" said Andrew Goode of the Atlantic Salmon Federation, a group that works to protect wild salmon. ""It can get bogged down if the agencies have different ideas on how the species should be managed.""

Finally, a spokesman with the National Fisheries Institute, which represents commercial fishers, said salmon isn't even the half of it when it comes to overlapping rules. ""There's more where that came from, unfortunately, when it comes to seafood,"" said Gavin Gibbons, a spokesman for the group. His group is particularly critical of a provision included in the 2008 farm legislation that allows the U.S. Department of Agriculture to regulate catfish. Not all fish, just catfish. He called those rules a ""a demonstrable special interest effort."" American catfish farmers asked for the new rules; they say foreign fish farmers are selling inferior products in the U.S.

Gibbons praised the National Marine Fisheries Service, though, for its work conserving fish stocks. ""They're not perfect, and there are controversies about catch shares and limits and that sort of thing,"" he said. ""But broadly speaking, they're a world-class organization in terms of sustainability""

In ruling on Obama's statement, we found that he's right about the regulatory division on salmon, with different agencies responsible for the fish when they're in freshwater versus when they're in saltwater. In fact, he leaves out a lot of detail, including the role of the states. The actual regulatory scene is even more complicated. But Fish and Wildlife in the Interior Department does have authority over fish when they're in freshwater, and the National Marine Fisheries Service in the Department of Commerce regulates them in saltwater",Mostly True,"January 26, 2011"
"""New England already has access to ample supplies of natural gas.""","
For years, Weaver’s Cove Energy, the company that wants to develop a liquefied natural gas terminal in Fall River, has battled critics in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, who have fought the project on several fronts.

Opponents say the terminal -- and massive tankers making regular trips through Narragansett Bay -- would pose a serious safety risk to communities on Mount Hope Bay and cause widespread environmental damage. They also say the region already has enough natural gas and doesn’t need a new terminal.

The four U.S. senators from the two states, who all oppose the terminal, cited the supply argument in a letter they sent in November to a key Senate appropriations committee, urging it to prohibit the Federal Regulatory Commission from using federal money to approve the terminal.

With temperatures plummeting –– and the Weaver’s Cove project far from resolved –– we thought this was a good time to delve into the issue, focusing on the senators’ claim that New England has ample supplies of natural gas, and therefore doesn’t need the new terminal. We chose Sen. Jack Reed as the speaker for this item because he issued a news release about the letter.

The senators cited an analysis by the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources (DOER) that was summarized in a Nov. 16, 2009 letter the department sent to federal regulators: ""DOER asserts that it is unclear to what extent, if any, Weaver Cove’s LNG supply is needed to meet the region’s gas supply needs. . .""

In the letter, the Massachusetts energy office staff reported that within the past year, two new or expanded LNG facilities were completed in the Northeast,  adding to the ""large excess supply already in the natural gas market.""

They also cited other increased supplies and a drop in demand for natural gas. Those were among many changes in the region’s electricity and natural gas marketplace that occurred since the Weaver’s Cove project was first initiated in 2002, they said.  As a result, they said, ""it is unclear why there would be demand for additional LNG infrastructure.""

We then found Damien Gaul, an analyst for the Energy Information Administration, a research arm of the U.S. Department of Energy. Gaul referred us to a recent administration projection showing natural gas demand nationally increasing from 23 trillion cubic feet in 2008 to 26.4 trillion cubic feet in 2035, a growth rate of .6 percent annually.

""We don’t believe the U.S. has a need for more LNG deliveries,"" said Gaul, who emphasized his agency does not issue opinions on specific LNG proposals.

""We currently have the capacity to handle five times the demand we have now. Does the U.S. need more LNG? Probably not. Does the Northeast need more? Probably not.""

The natural gas supply issue also arose at a hearing for electric utility National Grid before the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission on Oct. 20, 2010.

Elizabeth D. Arangio, U.S. director of gas supply planning for National Grid, said several new sources of gas have been created in the Northeast, with more to come soon. She concluded: ""So at this point, the market doesn’t technically need more supply in this area in addition to those projects ...""

At the same hearing, Bruce Oliver, a consultant hired by the PUC, said the recession has reduced the demand for LNG. ""That is, the overall demand in the region has declined due to the economy and other factors, energy-efficiency activity, etc. That activity negates a lot of the factors that were driving the need for a Weaver’s Cove type of supply.""

So why would Weaver’s Cove spend millions of dollars fighting to develop a project to deliver a product to a market that doesn’t need it?

We asked Gordon Shearer, president of Hess LNG LLC, who has spearheaded the Weaver’s Cove project. He responded with a question: If New England has enough gas, he asked, why are prices for natural gas here much higher than in the rest of the country? (Gas prices vary widely across the country; the EIA finds prices in New England are generally several dollars higher per thousand cubic feet than the national average.) The high prices, Shearer said, show the region needs more gas.

He also said the Massachusetts Energy Office used faulty arithmetic in its study and failed to note that existing pipelines don’t have enough capacity to handle much of the new LNG supplies. He also dismissed the federal reports, saying commercial forecasters tend to see a need for more imports.

But documents Shearer provided told a mixed story. For instance, a report from Spectra Energy described the company’s efforts to pipe more gas to the Northeast, but it said nothing about the need for more gas from other sources.   

Another report, the 2010 Statistical Guide by the Northeast Gas Association, reports that ""an era of abundant supplies appears to have arrived"" and that is having a positive impact on natural gas prices.

The rapid development of shale gas supplies in New York and Pennsylvania are expected to  produce substantially more gas for the U.S. market, the report said. It noted that some proposed LNG projects, including one offshore of New Jersey, have been withdrawn recently because of the changing market conditions.

To summarize: The Massachusetts and federal energy offices say there is an ample supply of natural gas. So does National Grid, the largest local utility.

Weaver’s Cove contention -- that the region’s relatively high gas prices prove there’s not enough supply -- may make theoretical sense. But it hasn’t convinced the regulators so far. Nor us",True,"January 23, 2011"
"""We're worse than a Third World country in terms of water quality and the way we treat our sewage.""","
Industrial pollution made national news and made Cleveland the butt of jokes in 1969 after the Cuyahoga River caught fire -- not for the first time -- and did $50,000 damage to bridges. The fire helped focus attention on environmental problems and contributed to passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972.

Water pollution from sanitary sewer and storm runoff has had a lower profile. But the issue has been important to Cleveland City Councilman Mike Polensek ""for more years than I care to recall,"" he says. There are almost two miles of lakefront in his ward and a good portion of that is public beach.

Polensek spoke at a meeting of the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District in November to support its $3 billion settlement with EPA that could triple sewer rates in Cleveland and about 60 suburbs, but will pay for mandated construction work to deal with combined sanitary and storm sewer overflows.

""Let's face it, this is the year 2010 and we're worse than a Third World country in terms of water quality and the way we treat our sewage,"" Polensek told sewer district trustees. ""What we're paying for now is really an indictment of the 40-year delay in living up to the Clean Water Act.""

PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look to see if there is any truth to his comparison.

Polensek is notably outspoken, and ""Third World"" sounded like dramatic hyperbole. But the councilman told PolitiFact Ohio he was not exaggerating and would not water down his remarks.

""It's outrageous in America in 2010 that we have tributaries as polluted as the Tigris and Euphrates,"" he said. ""It's unconscionable when you see the filth that comes down that creek after a rainstorm. We have the technology to prevent it. What we haven't got is elected officials with the (guts) to make the tough decisions. They have deferred and deferred and passed the proverbial bleeping buck. You pay now or pay later.""

Two side-by-side beaches, Euclid Beach and Villa Angela, are a particular concern. Both are close to Euclid Creek, which drains a 24-square-mile section of eastern Cuyahoga County into Lake Erie. Both beaches were too unhealthy for swimming on 48 percent of the days last summer, according to the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District.

From May 2 to Sept. 6, average bacterial levels sampled daily exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's maximum E. coli standard by 40 percent. (The standard is a density of 235 parts per 100 ml of water, indicating the presence of human or animal waste that could make swimmers sick.)

""It should be a national embarrassment,"" Polensek said. ""It's a sin that we have those types of bacterial levels.""

He sees improving Great Lakes water quality as an economic development issue and a strategic defense issue, because ""We don't have to worry about trying to get water across a border.""

He is angriest about health issues.

""Where do they think our drinking water comes from?"" he asked, noting he's had complaints about respiratory, eye and ear infections blamed on contact with lake water. Women have reported vaginal infections, he said.

PolitiFact Ohio found support for Polensek's anger.

The National Resources Defense Council found Cleveland the worst urban area on the Great Lakes in bacterial samples, with the highest risk of gastrointestinal illness on Great Lakes beaches. East Side beaches get 55 percent of the nearly 5 billion gallons of raw sewage dumped into the lake in Greater Cleveland per year.

Euclid Creek is the most polluted tributary in the region.

But is it Third World?

""Third World"" once designated countries not aligned politically with the West or the East. Now it generally refers to underdeveloped and developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, but it has no single definition. ""There is no established convention for the designation of 'developed' and 'developing' countries or areas in the United Nations system,"" says the UN Statistics Division.

""An estimated 90 percent of all wastewater in developing countries is discharged untreated directly into rivers, lakes or the oceans,"" according to the United Nations Environment Programme, but we could find no benchmark characterizing recreational or bathing water of developing nations or ""Third World"" quality.

We turned for perspective to an expert not involved in local politics or government: scientist Sandra L. McLellan of the Great Lakes Water Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Her specialty is environmental toxicology, and her laboratory's major focus is investigating connections between environmental processes and human health. Her current projects involve sewage pollution in rivers and at beaches.

She did not dispute Polensek, though she preferred more careful wording. ""I think the accurate statement would be that during the time of a combined sewage overflow we're no better than a developing country,"" she said.

She found it particularly startling and significant that the regional sewer district reports more than 80 sewage overflows in a typical season on just the East Side beaches near Euclid Creek.

""It's a pretty bad situation and not up to what other cities have done,"" McLellan said. ""That's like the 1970s or '80s for most cities. They should have only two or three (overflows) a year.""

In Milwaukee, she said, construction in 1993 of a deep tunnel system reduced overflows from 50-60 per year to 2.5. That's also the specific goal of the Euclid Creek Tunnel, the first part of the sewer district's Project Clean Lake, on which construction will begin in March.

The bottom line, she said, is what happens during overflows:  ""It's a completely open sewer going directly to the rivers and streams. It is like Third World.""

So where does that leave Polensek’s statement? 

So we find Polensek’s statement has some elements of truth, but that also you need to know some important details to completely evaluate its accuracy",Half True,"January 4, 2011"
"""The Greenest County in America.""","
In metro Atlanta, the land of smog alerts and farmland-turned-to-suburbs, one local county makes a bold claim about its efforts to be environmentally conscious.

DeKalb County, its website says, is ""the greenest county in America.""

Let's put that on some recycled paper and send it to each of the county's estimated 750,000 residents.

DeKalb's communications director, Burke Brennan, sent PolitiFact Georgia an e-mail making the case for the county. It includes:
  

""In DeKalb County, we are taking the lead on sustainability ...  we are one step closer to being the greenest county in America,"" DeKalb County Chief Executive Officer Burrell Ellis said in 2009 when the county was honored by the ARC.

Many folks we discussed this claim with used phrases like ""bold"" or ""ambitious"" to describe DeKalb's audacity, not willing to publicly dismiss it. Some were willing to criticize the claim.

""That's all a good case for them to be one of the greenest counties in Georgia,"" said Mark Woodall, Georgia chapter chairman of the Sierra Club, which claims to be the largest grassroots environmental organization in the state. ""DeKalb being the greenest county in America seems pretty unthinkable.""

Being ""green,"" means many things these days. Some organizations have occasionally released surveys rankings America's greenest cities, but we found few similar rankings of counties. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a non-profit organization that works to improve health and health care for Americans, earlier this year looked at the environmental health of each U.S. county. One category was physical health. The foundation used data put together by researchers from the EPA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine the physical health of each county. The criteria included how many days the air was unhealthy, the number of days the air was unhealthy due to ozone, access to healthy foods and how many liquor stores were in a county. DeKalb ranked near the bottom of Georgia counties, 153rd, in terms of physical health.

Some categories that DeKalb is bragging about are difficult to compare.

In other areas, such as the number of LEED-certified buildings, Dekalb has competition. Gwinnett had three LEED-certifiied structures, according to the U.S. Green Building Council. DeKalb is an Energy Star partner -- a federal effort to protect the environment through energy-efficient practices -- but so are Cobb, Fulton and Gwinnett counties and the city of Atlanta.

On hiking and biking trails, DeKalb may run into some argument about having the most in Georgia. Cobb County, for example, lists about 75 miles of trails within its cities and unincorporated areas.

It was suggested we look at Arlington County, Va. to find another county that could make a case it is greener than DeKalb. The county has a page on its website with more than a dozen awards and recognition for its sustainable community and environmental efforts. Arlington won two National Association of Counties Achievement Awards this year for its recycling efforts. That organization also named Arlington its Outstanding Civil Engineering Project award in 2006 for its Green Building Program.

Other counties, like Boulder, Colo., have goals such as reducing outdoor water use by 50 percent by using indigenous plants and recycling 50 percent of construction waste.

DeKalb's case was muddied in December when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency fined $453,000 for 836 sewage spills over the last five years. The EPA estimates there are about 40,000 spills from the nation's 25,000 sewage systems a year. California officials reported about 2,000 spills into the San Francisco Bay in 2008.

Brennan noted the day after the fine was announced, county commissioners voted 6-1 to spend $1.345 billion to make repairs to its water and sewer system, nearly twice as much money as the EPA recommended. DeKalb taxpayers will pay higher water and sewer bills to help fund the work.

Despite the fine, Brennan stuck by DeKalb's claim.

""Nobody here is claiming perfection, but based on the programs, awards, designations and initiatives DeKalb has in place and ongoing, I am sticking with the motto 'DeKalb is the greenest county in America,' "" Brennan told us in an e-mail.

""After all, 'Cowboy Capital of the World' was already taken,"" added Brennan, referring to Oakdale, Calif.

DeKalb has certainly tried to make its mark as an environmentally conscious county. But DeKalb's claim of being the ""greenest county"" in the nation ignores critical facts that would give a visitor to its web site a different impression",True,"January 3, 2011"
"""A 5 percent increase in domestic production would increase the world supply by less than 1 percent and do almost nothing to our dependence on foreign oil. This would also have virtually no effect on the price of gas at the pump.""","
On Dec. 1, 2010, Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar announced that the Obama administration would not allow oil and gas drilling through 2017 in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico.

That decision reversed one by the administration weeks before the April 20, 2010, Deepwater Horizon explosion.

December's announcement prompted cheers from U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat who represents Congressional District 20 in South Florida.

In a Dec. 1 press release, Wasserman Schultz wrote:

""A 5 percent increase in domestic production would increase the world supply by less than 1 percent and do almost nothing to our dependence on foreign oil. This would also have virtually no effect on the price of gas at the pump, which is something every consumer really cares about. Adding a fraction of a percent to the global oil supply will not lower gas prices and ignores the critical need to develop alternative energy supplies that finally break our addiction to fossil fuels.""

The Truth-O-Meter has examined several claims about oil drilling and gas prices. But we wanted to know for this Truth-O-Meter, is Wasserman Schultz right? 
Would a 5 percent increase in domestic production increase the world supply by less than 1 percent, and why did she choose that 5 percent number anyway? Was she correct that such production would do almost nothing to our dependence on foreign oil and have virtually no effect on price at the pump?

We pulled background about oil drilling and gas prices from a June 2008 Truth-O-Meter ruling on U.S. Sen. and then-presidential candidate John McCain, who used the high price of gas as part of his argument to expand drilling. PolitiFact ruled False on his claim: ""We must deal with the here and now and assure affordable fuel for America by increasing domestic production.""

Background on drilling and gas prices

PolitiFact wrote:

The political momentum for offshore drilling has always risen and fallen along with gas prices. But while there are strong arguments that can be made in favor of offshore drilling, reducing the cost of gas ""here and now"" isn't one of them, according to oil experts and economists -- many of whom support the plan.

For starters, the lead time for oil exploration takes years. Even if offshore drilling areas opened up tomorrow, experts say it would take at least 10 years to realize any significant production. And even then, they say, the U.S. contribution to the overall global oil market would not be enough to make a significant dent in the price of gas.

""Drilling offshore to lower oil prices is like walking an extra 20 feet per day to lose weight,"" said David Sandalow, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, and author of Freedom from Oil. ""It's just not going to make much difference.""

It takes years to bring new oil wells online, said Mike Rodgers, a leading oil expert with PFC Energy in Washington. Companies need to drill exploratory wells, then discovery wells around the exploratory wells that show promise. Shipyards that build platforms, a two- to three-year job, are already booked solid. 
""It's foolish to sell it as a short-term solution to high gas prices,"" Rodgers said. ""Opening off-shore drilling would have no impact whatsoever on gas prices today.""

Warning! Math starts here

Now back to Wasserman Schultz's claim. We asked her spokesman Jonathan Beeton for background information and he sent an e-mail with links to the documents Wasserman Schultz used. We're warning you now: This documentation includes lots of math.

For starters, Beeton pointed us to a map from the U.S. Department of Interior attached to a March 31, 2010, press release which shows that drilling in the Eastern Gulf could increase production by .274 millions of barrels a day. The chart also states that in 2007, U.S. domestic production was about 5.07 million barrels of oil a day. That translates to about 5.4 percent increase -- that's why Wasserman Schultz uses a 5 percent increase.

Beeton then turned to the Energy Information Administration, which provides statistics and analysis to the U.S. Department of Energy and Congress. The EIA showed that the U.S. consumes 19.5 million barrels per day as of 2008. EIA also states that global consumption of oil is about 85.46 million barrels a day (look for the world total on the bottom of the same chart for 2008.)

Then Beeton did some math:

Divide the amount that drilling in the Eastern Gulf could increase daily production -- .274 millions of barrels -- by global consumption of oil -- 85.46 million barrels a day -- and you get .32 percent increase to the world supply. That is less than 1 percent.

With current U.S. production of 5.07 millions of barrels a day, and U.S. consumption of 19.5 millions of barrels a day, then we produce 26 percent of what we consume, Beeton wrote. Increasing production to 5.344 (5.07 + 0.274) millions of barrels a day, would increase that number to 27.4 percent -- or a decrease reliance on foreign oil by 1.4 percentage points.

The experts weigh in

We ran Wasserman Schultz's claim by Jamie Webster, a senior consultant with PFC Energy, which tracks oil production and demand globally and whose clients are governments, including the United States., and oil and gas companies. We also heard from Daniel J. Weiss, who has written extensively about oil prices and policy and is a senior fellow and director of climate strategy at the Center for American Progress, which describes itself as a progressive think tank. Both Webster and Weiss agreed with Wasserman Schultz.

A 5 percent increase would produce around 200,000 to 300,000 barrels of oil a day while the world produced about 85 million barrels a day this year, Webster said.

""An increase like that would be one-third of a percent,"" Webster said. ""It could feasibly back up some potential imports but it would be almost a rounding error.""

As for prices at the pump, ""it wouldn't budge the market at all. We would still need to import gasoline; it would not have any impact. You wouldn't notice it at all.""

Weiss pointed to a chart from the Energy Information Administration, which shows projections of gas and oil costs in 2020 and 2030.

""Her point that it's going to make no difference in supply, no real difference in price, is correct,"" Weiss said.

Let's review: Wasserman Schultz's math adds up -- Gulf drilling does indeed represent about 5 percent of current domestic production, and a 5 percent increase would barely register in terms of the world supply. And the experts we found for this Truth-O-Meter as well as ones cited in the past about McCain's claim agree that expanding drilling now would have little effect at the pump any time soon",True,"December 13, 2010"
"Low-flow toilets ""can cost homeowners up to $1,000 each.""","
Thanks to The Dunwoody Crier, the minds of your AJC PolitiFact Georgia scribes are in the toilet.

An op-ed by DeKalb County Commissioner Elaine Boyer derided what she called ""the toilet tax,"" which was passed in response to the region's drought.

""Two years ago, the commission unnecessarily started mandating that low-flush toilets had to be installed in older homes for sales to get to the closing table,"" Boyer wrote in the Oct. 27 issue. ""Those toilets can cost homeowners up to $1,000 each.""

Toilets? For $1,000?

We were, ahem, bowled over. Does a commode really cost that much? We researched the ordinance and called plumbers to find out.

A 2008 DeKalb ordinance requires that newly purchased buildings have low-flow toilets and other water-saving fixtures installed before the county turns on water service. The ordinance applies to residential and commercial properties built before Jan. 1, 1993, in the county's unincorporated areas.

The Department of Watershed Management performs free inspections to certify a building is compliant.

Buildings that will be torn down, foreclosed, or transferred between spouses or from a parent to a child are exempt.

If the switch costs more than $1,000 per toilet for a residential property, you can get a financial hardship waiver.

DeKalb County offers a rebate program to defray the cost. Water customers can purchase from a list of eligible toilets and receive up to $100. After a quick search, AJC PolitiFact Georgia found a $160 toilet on the online list.

A Boyer spokeswoman emphasized the toilet ordinance was not the main focus of the commissioner's article. Her target was DeKalb's recently instituted foreclosure registry, which requires banks and other owners of foreclosed homes to register them online. She tried to tank the proposal, but it passed in July.

The spokeswoman also referred us to Robert Broome, a lobbyist with the Atlanta Board of Realtors. Broome told us that the group supports water conservation but opposes DeKalb's rule because it ties the installation of those fixtures to real estate transactions.

The change can be expensive, Broome said. He's been told of cases where homeowners have had to rip up dry wall or old plumbing to comply.

Broadly speaking, toilets can cost just about anything. Consider the porcelain throne of rock royalty John Lennon. It sold in an August auction for about $15,000.

Lee Krinsky, general manager of Plumb Works Inc. in Atlanta, recalled a toilet that cost $13,000, excluding the $1,000 seat. It was hand-painted with a floral design. The seat, which was inlaid with gold, was fashioned in the shape of a seashell.

A more typical low-flow toilet can range from $500 to $800, Krinsky said. This includes the cost of purchasing the toilet, picking it up from the supplier, installing it, and hauling the old one away.

If installation goes smoothly, and most do, a plumber can be in and out of the bathroom in an hour-and-a-half, Krinsky said. Given the high cost of water, the toilet will easily pay for itself.

For another opinion, we talked to Ellen Whitaker, executive director of the Plumbing and Mechanical Association of Georgia. The trade organization once opposed low-flow ordinances but switched positions after the drought.

Plumbers in Whitaker's group were reluctant to give a price range for the job. Variables such as the condition of the old toilet and plumbing can make it hard to predict, she said.

Consider the toilet flange, Whitaker said. The ring connects the toilet to a drain pipe and stops smells from seeping up through the commode. If the flange is stuck in place, a plumber might spend extra hours removing it.

This means $1,000 ""can be a good price,"" Whitaker said.

Of course, you could install the toilet yourself. If you purchased that $160 toilet we found online, hauled it home yourself, got the $100 rebate, and encountered no unusual problems, your grand total would be $60, plus tax.

A low-flow toilet can cost as little as dinner and a movie or as much as a Toyota Corolla.

The cost of professional installation varies, but can often fall in the $500 to $800 range. Do-it-yourselfers can spend less than $100, thanks to DeKalb's rebate program.

If the job costs more than $1,000, you can get a waiver.

Very strictly speaking, Boyer's right. Installing a low-flow toilet ""can"" cost up to $1,000.

But in many cases, it will cost much less.

Boyer's claim could have used more explanation and context, but much of it holds water",Half True,"December 1, 2010"
"""We were one of the first states in the U.S. to build sewers, to bring the treatment plant on line.""","
In hindsight, World Toilet Day came not a moment too soon.

With a sputtering economy and high unemployment, Rhode Island has had precious few bright spots to brag about in recent years. But on Nov. 19, the Narragansett Bay Commission, which operates two major sewage-treatment plants, celebrated World Toilet Day by pointing with pride to some of the most dark and foul parts of our state: the sewers.

""Think about it,"" Narragansett Bay Commission public affairs manager Jamie Samons said. ""We were one of the first states in the U.S. to build sewers, to bring the treatment plant on line, and now we’re tackling CSOs (combined sewer overflows). How lucky are we to know that we can flush reliably.""

Truth be told, it’s been awhile since we’ve thought about that topic. But with World Toilet Day as our inspiration, we decided to give it some thought. So we set out to prove or disprove the claim that Rhode Island was ""one of the first states"" to build sewers and a sewage treatment plant.

A 1990 Narragansett Bay Commission document, ""Reclaiming Our Resources: A History of The Providence Sewage Treatment System,"" sets the scene, taking us to the year 1854 when Providence, then the seventh largest U.S. city, faced its second cholera epidemic in five years. The city’s superintendent of health, Dr. Edwin Snow, describes the Moshassuck River as ""filthy as any common sewer,"" saying ""the stench arising from it at times pervades the whole neighborhood"" and ""at any time, dogs, cats and hogs may be seen in the water in every stage of decomposition.""

But there’s good news: ""In the 1870s a sewer system was constructed which conveyed the city’s waste to be discharged through a series of 65 combined sewer overflows into the rivers and harbor,"" the document states. And in 1884, Providence sent City Engineer Samuel M. Gray to Europe to study the latest methods of treating household and industrial waste. He recommended a system to collect sewage at Field’s Point and treat it with a ""chemical precipitation method""  used in England.

In 1901, the Providence Sewage Treatment system began operating, and the commission document says, ""The chemical precipitation plant, the third of its kind in the United States, was described as ‘The largest of its type ever built.’ ""

So did that make us ""one of the first""?

To begin with, America certainly wasn’t the first country to come up with this sewer idea. In the Mesopotamian empire (3500 to 2500 BC), some homes were connected to a stormwater drain system to carry away waste, and the Romans built the Cloaca Maxima (AKA the central sewer system) in about 800 BC, according to P.F. Cooper’s ""Historical Aspects of Wastewater Treatment.""

Also, Rhode Island certainly wasn’t the first place in America with sewers. New York, Chicago and Boston battle it out over which had the first sewer system, says Jon Schladweiler, the Arizona Water Association historian who runs the sewerhistory.org website and a traveling exhibit on sewer history. But Providence wasn’t far behind the front runners, he says.

Brooklyn began construction in 1857 of ""the first effective planned sewerage system in the country designed to remove sanitary wastes and stormwater,"" and Chicago began building ""the premiere sewer system of the time"" in 1859, according to Martin V. Melosi's ""The Sanitary City: Urban Infrastructure in America from Colonial Times to the Present.""

In ""The Impact of Sanitary Reform,"" Jon A. Peterson says New York built about 125 miles of sewer lines between 1849 and 1865, and Boston installed about 100 miles of sewer lines between 1849 and 1873. He also mentions sewer projects under way in the 1850s in Chicago and Jersey City, N.J. And he says, ""In New England, where urbanization had advanced furthest, engineers devised major systems for Providence in 1869.""

Providence also gets some love in a footnote found in ""American Sewerage Practice,"" a seminal 1914 text by Leonard Metcalf and Harrison P. Eddy. ""The sewerage system of Providence was declared in 1881 by Rudolph Hering, after a personal investigation of such work in our cities and in Europe, to be equal to anything abroad and much better than the work elsewhere in this country. The system was designed in 1869 by J. Herbert Shedd, then chief engineer of the water works and later city engineer.""

And ""Mr. Shedd’s report of 1874 on these sewerage works was long a famous engineering document,"" Metcalf and Eddy say. ""It is only right to point out that the Providence sewers formed for some years the model American system.""

You hear that, Connecticut? ""Model American system."" After a shout-out from Metcalf and Eddy, it’s safe to say Rhode Island enjoyed sewer All-Star status.

But did we also have one of the first sewage treatment plants?

Metcalf and Eddy say, ""The first extensive treatment plant utilized chemical precipitation and was built in Worcester, Mass., in 1889-1890."" Sewerhistory.org mentions an East Orange, N.J., treatment plant built in 1888 or 1889. And in ""Municipal Wastewater Treatment,"" Andrew Stoddard says, ""In 1886, the first wastewater treatment plant was constructed to protect beaches at Coney Island.""

But, hot dog, Providence wasn’t far behind with its treatment plant starting to hum in 1901. And by 1909, there were still only 19 cities with more than 30,000 people treating their sewage, Joel A. Tarr notes in ""Goodbye to the Flush Toilet",True,"November 28, 2010"
"""More people hunt and fish in Texas in a given year than attend the... games of the Dallas Cowboys, the Dallas Mavericks, the Houston Texans and the Houston Rockets combined.""","
Seeking re-election earlier this year, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples threw a wake-'em-up line at the Austin American-Statesman's editorial board: ""More people hunt and fish in Texas in a given year than attend the... games of the Dallas Cowboys, the Dallas Mavericks, the Houston Texans and the Houston Rockets combined.""

We figured Thanksgiving (ahem, New Orleans Saints vs. Dallas Cowboys, mid-afternoon, Arlington) would be fitting for checking Staples' Aug. 31 comparison of hunting's appeal in Texas to the drawing power of several major sports franchises.

Cody McGregor, Staples' campaign manager, told us via e-mail that Staples based his statement on statistics in a December 2007 report from the National Shooting Sports Foundation. He pointed us to a press release accompanying the report, which states: ""More people hunt and fish in Texas than attend Dallas Cowboys, Dallas Mavericks, Houston Texans and Houston Rockets games combined (2.68 million vs. 2.6 million).""

And where did these figures come from?

Lance Lemmonds, spokesman for the sportsmen's foundation, told us the hunting and fishing totals for Texas were drawn from a 2006 national survey for the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. Next, we learned from the agency's website that it commissions the survey every five years (the next one will be taken in 2011). According to the 2006 survey results, 2.64 million Texans went fishing or hunting in 2006.

Lemmonds said an outside firm researched attendance totals for the four sports teams. He said he did not have additional information.

That left us to search for attendance totals. And online, we found home-field attendance figures for each of the franchises for the time period on websites kept by ESPN, the sports cable TV network, and DatabaseBasketball.com, which posts many sports statistics. Anyway, the combined attendance for the franchises approached 2.6 million, a total we reached by adding up attendance for the Cowboys in 2006 (506,308), the Mavericks in 2006-07 (814,009), the Texans in 2006 (561,469) and the Rockets in 2006-07 (678,262). The basketball season extends from fall to summer, so attendance numbers for basketball franchises aren't limited to a single calendar year.

This curve ball: The National Shooting Sports Foundation comparison leaves out attendance at professional baseball games. The Houston Astros drew nearly 2.8 million home fans and the Texas Rangers nearly 2.5 home fans in 2005, according to Baseball Almanac web posts. Swap in the Rangers, say, for the lowest attendance figure that we found (Cowboys, 506,308) and the four-franchise total would be about 4.5 million--far more than the Texans fishing or hunting in the state in 2006.

Then again, in his first-blush response to us, McGregor of Staples' campaign counseled against taking franchise attendance figures at face value. ""The game attendance numbers count a ton of season ticket holders as 'people' attending a game each time they go to a game, but really you should only count a person one time if they attend multiple games of the same franchise in order to make it apples to apples with the hunt/fish number,"" his e-mail said.

Regardless, it looks like a few years ago the state's hunting and fishing enthusiasts exceeded the combined home turnout for the four selected sports franchises.

Next, we tried to corral updated numbers to see whether the statement still held true when Staples spoke to the Statesman.

We added up the home attendance figures for the latest completed seasons for each of the franchises, getting 2.78 million. Next, we contacted the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department in search of an estimate of the people who went fishing or hunting in Texas more recently than the federal survey year of 2006. Harvey said there is no post-2006 count that the agency touts. With the agency's help, though, we divined a way toward a ballpark estimate for Texans who went hunting or fishing last year. First, we determined that the number of hunting and fishing licenses sold to Texans increased 11 percent from 2006 to the fiscal year that ended Aug. 31, 2010. We then multiplied that rate increase by the 2006 federal estimate of Texans who fished and hunted in the state (2.6 million) and added the result to the 2006 figure. Our calculation: More than 2.9 million Texans went hunting or fishing in the state last year.

All told, it's risky business to stake a claim, as Staples did, on a nearly five-year-old federal survey. But more recent numbers suggest that the claim still holds true: More people hunted and fished in Texas than attended home games for the four selected Dallas and Houston sports franchises in their latest completed seasons",True,"November 25, 2010"
"Sewer backups into basements caused the ""vast majority of the damage to homes and buildings"" in Milwaukee’s July floods, but federal flood insurance doesn’t cover them.","
Three months after Milwaukee’s watery nightmare, federal officials have paid out a whopping $45 million to 31,000 people with damaged residences. A presidential disaster declaration opened the money spigot. 
But while the floodwaters have long ago receded, controversy hasn’t.

Milwaukee Alderman Jim Bohl and two colleagues, Willie Wade and Jim Witkowiak, are airing a new complaint. In a Nov. 3, 2010 news release, they punched the gift horse -- FEMA -- in the mouth for pushing federal flood insurance they say is a bad deal for most of their constituents.

""Plain and simple, flood insurance does not cover damage caused by sewer discharge backups in basements, and by far that is exactly what caused the vast majority of damage to homes and buildings in Milwaukee in July,"" Bohl said in the release. ""The fear I have is that many people will buy flood insurance that is of no use to them. I think this is selling false hope, and I think it is just wrong.""

Strong words.

Is Bohl right that the ""vast majority of damage to homes and buildings"" was due sewer backups, not surface water? And that the federal insurance program is no help?

First let’s clarify: That $45 million in disaster claims already paid out by the Federal Emergency Management Agency is separate from payments made by FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program. The insurance comes in handy when floods don’t rise to the level of a presidential disaster declaration.

More than 1,400 people in Milwaukee County have federal flood insurance, including some who don’t live anywhere near a river or creek. In the last three decades those Milwaukee County residents paid premiums totaling $990,000 and filed claims totaling $14.4 million, FEMA says.

What were those claims for?

Well, none were for sewer backups, something FEMA officials acknowledge are not covered under the insurance program.

Water entering your house from sewer pipes is not ""flooding"" under the official federal insurance definition, which starts (we’re not making this up) with: ""A flood is an excess of water on land that is normally dry.""

Even if torrential rains cause water to infiltrate sewer pipes that back up  into basements, that doesn’t count as flooding. So Bohl is right on that point.

FEMA likes to stress that policies can cost as little as $119 a year, but if you ask they readily acknowledge premiums average $570 a year nationwide. They say the insurance fills in an important gap -- basic private homeowner’s insurance policies exclude flood coverage. They recommend that you use a federal website to decide if the insurance is right.

The aldermen say, ""buyer beware.""

But what about the July flooding, which dumped eight inches of rain on parts of Milwaukee. Did most of the damage come from sewer backups?

Bohl, who represents a far northwest side district, provided PolitiFact Wisconsin with a log of 1,200 calls from his constituents to the city’s Department of Public Works complaining of what the city calls ""backwater."" In Wade’s north side district -- the hardest hit in the city -- 1,950 people reported ""backwater"" problems.

To Bohl and Wade, the term ""backwater"" means water coming up from sewer pipes into a basement.

DPW confirmed the number of calls, but disagrees with that interpretation. ""Backwater"" is just water in the basement -- from any source, including surface flooding through window wells or a basement foundation, said City Engineer Jeffrey Polenske.

City public works officials do not track where the waters came from, so there is no city-wide accounting, Polenske said.

So we are left with anecdotal evidence -- reports by homeowners who are on the scene of the mess, though many may not have seen exactly where water entered.

Bohl, Wade and Alderman Jim Witkowiak’s aide, Michael McGuire, say sewer backups were easily the most frequent complaint at neighborhood meetings they hosted after the floods. DPW’s chief sewer design manager, Tim Thur, called it a ""majority"" of such complaints based on his department’s visits to those meetings.

FEMA has offered no official tally of basement flooding causes.

Other communities tracked their flood damage more closely and some reported a different view than that of the three aldermen. The differences reflect geography, condition of infrastructure, as well as differences in interpretation of what happened in July.

Both Shorewood and Whitefish Bay said half of flood victims reported rainwater flooding as opposed to sewage flooding.

In many cases that meant water invaded through window wells, foundation cracks or doorways, said Whitefish Bay assistant village manager Matt Schuenke. One-fifth or one-fourth blamed sewage, and the rest said it was a mixture.

""Overland flooding was a significant factor,"" Schuenke said.

In suburban Wauwatosa, sewage pipe backups into the basement were far more common than overland flooding, said City Engineer Bill Wehrley. But overland or surface water flooding contributes to the overload of the sanitary sewer system.

If rain water pours in through a basement window and floods a basement, that water drains back into the sanitary sewer system, overloads it and sends the resulting mix of clear water and sewage up into people’s basements, he said.

""You have to look at both,"" Wehrley said.

The Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District has no data on basement flooding causes, but spokesman Bill Graffin said the main culprit behind basement backups and sewer overflows is excess water getting into sanitary sewer pipes.

Let’s get out of the pool, and rule on this.

Bohl makes two related claims. Nobody has a clear answer on whether sewer backups into basements caused the ""vast majority"" of the damage. The evidence is anecdotal  and contradictory, which makes Bohl’s generalization more than a little problematic. It is true that damage from sewer backups is not covered under the federal flood insurance. So Bohl’s not all wet, but he went a bit overboard",Half True,"November 16, 2010"
"Rick Boucher ""helped write"" the cap-and-trade bill","The cap-and-trade bill to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is dominating the race for the 9th Congressional District seat out in the heart of coal country.

Republican challenger Morgan Griffith is pounding Democratic incumbent Rick Boucher for voting in favor of cap-and-trade. Griffith claims the legislation will kill jobs in the district, already beset with high unemployment.

A recent Griffith TV ad features a repeated clip of President Barack Obama professing, ""I love Rick Boucher."" The narrator says: ""Love the Obama Washington agenda? Rick Boucher does. Obama’s cap-and-trade plan kills our jobs and raises electricity costs. Boucher helped write it.""    

Cap-and-trade has stalled in the U.S. Senate. But PolitiFact Virginia wanted to examine what role Boucher had, if any, in drafting the legislation.  

What exactly is cap-and-trade?

Under the bill, the government would set a limit on how much carbon companies, such as electric utilities or manufacturers, can emit. The government would then issue permits for emissions to companies and allow them to buy and sell the permits with each other. Supporters say the policy would create a free-market system that will reduce emissions. Opponents argue that that it will kill jobs that rely on coal and other traditional fuel sources.

Griffith bases his claim that Boucher helped write the bill to on a story on news website SWVA Today in which Boucher defended his vote for cap-and-trade and acknowledged having a part in amending the bill.

Asked to clarify his role, Boucher explained that the alternative to cap-and-trade was to leave regulation to the Environmental Protection Agency, which he said  would be devastating for companies that rely on coal and their employees.

""That would be the worst possible outcome for the coal industry, coal jobs, for electric utilities that burn coal and electric consumers,"" Boucher told PolitiFact Virginia.

As a senior member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Boucher said he amended the legislation at the request of the coal and electric power industries in an effort to minimize the impact on coal jobs.  

Boucher’s changes included emissions credits that ensured that power plants could continue to use coal so long as they find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

""It’s certainly accurate to say that I was deeply involved in the process, but the ad is extraordinarily misleading because it suggests that I was doing this because it was something that the President of the Speaker of the House wanted,"" Boucher said. ""In fact, I took them on to get the deal that I got for coal.""

Boucher’s intentions were defended by Phil Smith, a spokesman for the United Mine Workers of America, who said the congressman went to bat for coal.

""The truth of the matter is that when that bill was originally introduced, there wasn’t one single dime in there in support of the coal industry,"" he said. ""What Rick Boucher did was to get involved in the negotiations and put $180 billion into it for coal.""   

Smith added: ""Without him getting involved, the handwriting would be on the wall for the coal industry at this point.""  

Melissa McHenry with American Electric Power said that the company was supportive of those changes that Boucher had made to cap-and-trade.

""It supports continued use of coal,"" she said. ""The alternative is EPA regulation and he recognized that that would have a significant impact to the detriment of the coal industry.""  

Let’s look back at the details.

Did Boucher help write cap-and-trade? Absolutely. But he did so to add protections for the coal industry and the jobs it provides in his district.

The ad implies that Boucher contributed to a job-killing bill, but his motive was to actually protect those jobs. So while the statement is accurate that he helped write it, the ad leaves out important details",Half True,"October 28, 2010"
"Tells David Cicilline, ""94 percent of the carbon emissions which you so want to get rid of are caused by nature.""","We all know about the theory of climate change, the idea that the earth is gradually warming because of pollution. Whenever the weather turns particularly hot or cold, we joke about it, often in supportive or derisive terms depending on our opinion on the issue.

Unlike some other Republicans who dismiss global warming, John Loughlin, who is running for Congress in the 1st District, has acknowledged that the climate is changing. However, he said during a September press conference, ""I think the data is unclear as to the extent of man-caused climate change. When you look at the total percentage of greenhouse gas emissions, a good number of them, in fact, the vast majority of them, are naturally occurring.""

He made a similar statement Oct. 19 during a WPRI/Providence Journal debate when challenged on the topic by his Democratic rival, David Cicilline. ""I'm not a scientist but I did work for NASA and when I was at NASA we had a scientist who I actually did some of the press release work for by the name of Dr. James Hansen at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Dr. Hansen released a peer-reviewed paper in the '70s that talked about global cooling. And then it's only later that he's kind of gotten a conversion to global warming.""

He went on to tell Cicilline, ""I'm saying really the earth is warming, but it's not conclusively caused by man. It's not conclusive. I mean 94 percent of the carbon emissions which you so want to get rid of are caused by nature.""

When people talk about carbon emissions, they are mostly talking about carbon dioxide, the gas we exhale and the gas plants need to grow. Unfortunately, when levels in the air become too high, it traps heat coming from the sun as part of the so-called ""greenhouse effect."" (Other gases such as methane and ozone also play a role, as do tiny particles known as aerosols.) The warmer air melts polar caps, raises sea levels and shifts ecosystems toward the poles. Plants and animals that can't adapt risk extinction.

Loughlin's 94-percent figure sounds very authoritative and specific. So we emailed Loughlin's campaign on Oct. 21, and called his spokeswoman a day later, to ask for the source. They have not responded.

Meanwhile, we emailed a copy of Loughlin's debate comment to Hansen.

""I never had any global cooling paper or talk or comment,"" he wrote back to us. ""The change of carbon dioxide, the increase year to year is entirely human-made. There is an up-and-down flux caused by vegetation growing (sucking carbon dioxide from the air) and decaying in the winter (releasing carbon dioxide), which is large -- this fluctuation is natural and does not alter the annual mean increase due to humans. He is speaking nonsense.""

So Hansen is saying that 0 percent of the increase in climate-changing carbon dioxide emissions is coming from nature, not the 94 percent claimed by Loughlin.

We still wondered where Loughlin might have gotten his 94-percent figure. So we contacted William F. Ruddiman, author of a widely used climate textbook who is at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.

He agreed with Hansen, saying that nature sends a lot of carbon in and out of the atmosphere every year and the sources can be pinpointed because fossil-fuel carbon has a slightly different composition than the carbon that is constantly recycled by nature.

Before the industrial revolution, the atmosphere had roughly 600 billion tons of carbon dioxide, according to Ruddiman. Above-ground vegetation contains about 610 billion tons of carbon and the surface oceans contain about 1,000 billion tons. (There's another 1,550 billion tons or so hidden in the soil and more in the deep ocean, but that doesn't circulate fast enough to play a big role in changes over decades or centuries.)

Each year, the atmosphere and ocean exchange about 75 billion tons; another 100 billion tons go back and forth between the air and the vegetation.

""In those exchanges, the carbon is just moving back and forth in nature and in equal numbers, so there is no net gain to the atmosphere,"" Ruddiman said.

Now add in the pollution generated by humans.

""I think what humans are doing now is something like 30 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year,"" said Ruddiman. That amount is small compared with the amount shuttled back and forth between the air, ocean and vegetation, and perhaps half of that gets pulled out of the air.

So we did some math. When there's 175 billion tons going into the air from natural sources along with 30 billion tons of pollution (for a total of 205 billion tons), that's 85 percent from natural sources.

The only problem: the 175 billion tons comes back out every year, so when critics say humans are having only a small impact on the process, they are misunderstanding -- or misstating -- the process, Ruddiman said.

""The amount of carbon dioxide humans are putting into the atmosphere is smaller but it's not balanced, and so it builds up over time and it causes a sizable net gain,"" Ruddiman explained.

""It may be 10 billion tons a year but much of it builds up year after year after year,"" he said, and persists in the atmosphere, trapping heat like a chemical blanket.

Scientists who have used a variety of techniques to track earth's changing climate over hundreds of thousands of years have found data that show carbon dioxide levels during that period never grew faster than 30 parts per million per 1,000 years. Yet the level has risen by that amount in just the last 17 years, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the international organization widely regarded by the scientific community as a leading authority on the topic.

The result is the warmer temperatures and melting icecaps widely documented around the globe.

And what about volcanoes? People think of them as sending lots of carbon dioxide in the air. It turns out that eruptions are a drop in the bucket, generating 0.2 billion tons annually, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

We also asked Ruddiman about the concept of global cooling, which critics also focus on. The fact is, in the 1970s, geologists were saying earth was coming out of a warm period and destined for another ice age. Core samples taken from the ocean floor combined with other data had allowed them to track the timing of past ice ages as changes in the earth's orbit exposed the planet to varying amounts of sunlight.

But even as scientists were tracking those cycles, which extend over thousands of years, other researchers in the '70s were warning that a carbon dioxide build-up was going to disrupt that cycle and overwhelm the natural cooling trend.

""I remember thinking that probably in one thousand to two thousand years, at most, we would see snow start accumulating in the high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere,"" Ruddiman said. ""That was reasonable from what we knew from ice age cycles. What very few of us were aware of was the buildup of carbon dioxide. Most of us are geologists, not geochemists,"" he said, explaining that by the 1980s the problem had become obvious.

""The same people who said, 'If nature remains in control we're going into a glaciation in the next 1,000 or 2,000 years' turned around and said, 'Yeah, but nature's not in control. Humans are intervening much faster than nature can do the job and so we're going into a warmer time,' "" Ruddiman recalled.

""It's been made to sound like scientists are flip-flopping, but it's just the natural evolution of science,"" he said. ""You broaden your point of view as you gain information that changes your conclusions. And that's what happened.""

Ultimately, the Loughlin campaign did not provide any evidence that nature is responsible for the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is the key problem stoking the fears of global warming. And the NASA scientist he mentioned told us Loughlin's comments were ""nonsense.""

There's plenty of room to debate aspects of climate change, such as the best way to prevent climate-related problems, how much money should be spent on prevention, and whether it's worth the investment if other countries aren't willing to seriously limit their carbon emissions.

But Loughlin's suggestion that nature is largely responsible for the looming problem is wrong",False,"October 28, 2010"
"Says Gov. Jim Doyle and the DNR have not put hunters first and mismanaged the deer herd; as a result ""the deer population has dwindled.""","
Scott Walker’s first deer hunting expeditions gave him a taste of the frustration that has been felt by many Wisconsin hunters: He got skunked.

Now, in his bid for governor, Walker has waded into the single most contentious state natural resources issue: the size of the state’s deer herd and how the balance is struck between the wishes of hunters, the effects of deer on the environment, the concerns of farmers and the safety of drivers.

The annual deer hunt helps drive tourism and, for many, helps define Wisconsin.

Walker, a Republican facing Democrat Tom Barrett in the Nov. 2, 2010 election, is a recent hunter, though his story may have a common ring to it.

Two years ago, on his first hunt, he saw a buck but couldn’t shoot, because he was in an area where hunters first had to kill a doe before they could shoot a buck.

Last year’s hunt was equally unsatisfying: Walker didn’t see a deer.

Walker made increasing the number of deer -- and the number of hunters -- a central part of a tourism plan he unveiled Oct. 14, 2010. In the three-page document, Walker says Gov. Jim Doyle and the state Department of Natural Resources have engaged in ""political games"" and ""put bureaucrats in Madison ahead of hunters of the state.""

The result, he argues, is a smaller herd, fewer deer taken and fewer hunters. In a news release, Walker claimed that the ""deer population has dwindled"" as a result of ""mismanagement"" by Doyle and the DNR.

That’s the statement we put in our cross hairs.

Is it true the deer population has dwindled? And, if so, is the frustration of hunter a result of political games and mismanagement in Madison?

We started with Walker, but his campaign said he was unavailable to talk to PolitiFact Wisconsin about the matter. Out hunting votes, no doubt. The campaign referred us to adviser Greg Kazmierski, a member of the Hunters Rights Coalition, a lobbying group and longtime critic of the DNR.

Kazmierski, owner of Buck Rub Outfitters Ltd. in the Town of Delafield, believes the DNR’s system of managing the deer herd -- and the hunt --  is out of whack.

His list of complaints is long: Deer population estimates, used to establish hunting targets, are ""not anywhere close to accurate""; the department itself doesn’t do enough to encourage hunting and is ""anti-hunter""; bureaucrats focus too much on other factors, such as car-deer accidents and farmers who have their crops damaged.

""We are moving in a direction that people want to give (hunting) up,"" said Kazmierski, whose business is based on hunting. ""There are too many rules and regulations.""

OK, let’s dig into the claim, starting with  the last word: ""dwindled.""

The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines dwindle as ""To become steadily less: shrink."" That can apply to the deer population in the state -- which is estimated at 1.3 million -- down from about 1.8 million in 2007.

But Walker’s statement glosses over two critical factors.

First, the population is an estimate -- no one knows exactly how many deer there are. Second, the numbers are down on purpose; the smaller herd is part of a policy compromise that involves many players and in some years a vote by the Legislature.

Under state law, the DNR must establish a ""post-hunt"" deer population goal.

Once every three years, that goal is voted on and approved by state lawmakers. It is not a decision for bureaucrats or the governor alone -- as Walker suggests when he blames them for mismanagement.

Everything starts with estimates of the overall deer herd -- an inexact science, but one that the state was praised for as a national leader in a 2006 review by out of state experts.

The DNR also receives advice from various groups and sportsmen in each county, via members of the Wisconsin Conservation Congress, a statewide network that has existed for 76 years.

The prospects for hunters are far from the only consideration that plays into the target deer population. When there are large numbers of deer, farmers complain of damage to their crops. In suburban areas, deer begin to show up, wandering in cul-de-sacs and backyards. And, of course, some become part of car-deer accidents.

For instance, as the number of deer has declined, so has the number of car-deer accidents: 16,338 in 2009, down from 17,555 in 2005 and 19,914 in 2001.

But after a disappointing 2009 hunt, many hunters blamed the DNR.

The post-hunt goal for the fall 2010 hunt was set last spring at about 794,000. That compares with a post-hunt goal of about 706,000 in 2005 and a post-hunt goal of about 704,000 in 2000.

So, while Walker argues the overall population is dwindling, the post-hunt goal has actually been increasing.

This year, a special committee recommended setting the post-hunt deer population at 745,636. The agency bumped it to 794,172, after taking into account that some members of the committee -- including Kazmierski -- wanted a goal in excess of 1 million.

Let’s look at some other numbers, which also relate to Walker’s claim -- that tourism is being harmed because the number of hunters is down.

Number of Wisconsin hunters: Licensed resident deer hunters were 800,372 in 2009, according to the DNR. That’s down 1,513 from the year before. But the number is up from 2005, when it was 780,719.

Number of out-of-state hunters: Non-resident licenses were 43,998 in 2009, down 1,575 -- about 3.5 percent -- from the year before. Out of state licenses totalled 42,397 in 2005.

Total deer harvest: In 2009, the total was 329,103, down 124,377 from the year before and 134,832 less than in 2005.

With that drop, it’s no wonder many hunters are frustrated.

In 2009, there were 39 deer killed per 100 licensed hunters, compared with 56 deer per 100 hunters in 2005. However, the percentage of successful hunters is actually even lower, because many hunters bag more than one deer.

Walker’s plan calls for the governor to appoint ""white tail deer trustee"" (We think ""deer overseer"" is a bit more poetic) to advise the state on deer management.

What do others say about the issue?

-- ""The deer herd is down, but it’s not decimated. It’s down, but it’s coming back,"" said Mark Toso, president of the Wisconsin Deer Hunters Association, a group he says has 1,000 members.

Toso said Walker is ""trying to feed off of anti-DNR sentiment"" and frustration among hunters: ""A lot of deer hunters only know what they see in the woods. If they don’t see a deer, it’s the DNR’s fault.""

-- Ed Harvey, chairman of the Conservation Congress, said the group was formed precisely to ""depoliticize"" deer management. He noted: ""If something’s politicized, it’s a lobbying group.""

He said the DNR has erred in estimated deer counts in some parts of the state, leading to hunter frustration: ""The department has taken some very big strides to correct that. It will take some time.""

Asked about the deer trustee advisor, Harvey’s response was simple:  ""That’s what the Congress does.""

-- ""In my professional opinion, the statement that the deer herd has been mismanaged is wrong,"" said Tim Van Deelen, a University of Wisconsin-Madison biology professor and expert on deer populations.

He noted the 2006 audit that found the state’s approach to counting the herd more rigorous than that of other states: ""When I consider the totality of the information available, I don't think the deer herd has dwindled -- decreased somewhat, maybe, but not substantially.""

OK, let’s get out of the woods.

Walker points to ""political games"" by Doyle and the DNR, whom he blames for the state’s ""dwindling"" deer population. That view is certainly shared by many frustrated hunters. However, Walker’s statement leaves out critical information: The size of the deer herd, itself an estimate, is down by design, not by mistake.

The goals are based on a system built on input from across the state and attempt to balance the concerns of hunters against those of farmers and drivers. Indeed, it has been successful in helping reduce the number of car-deer accidents. What’s more, in response to pressure from hunters, the 2010 population goal was increased",True,"October 24, 2010"
Says Tom Hughes supports paving over thousands of acres with over-development and sprawl.,"
Tom Hughes and Bob Stacey are both Democrats in their 60s running for president of Metro, the regional tri-county government best known for deciding what’s inside of the urban growth boundary and for running the Oregon Zoo. Hughes served as Hillsboro’s mayor from 2001 to January 2009. Stacey served as executive director of conservation group 1000 Friends of Oregon from 2002 to September 2009.

Stacey’s latest TV ad flashes a picture of Tom Hughes (in a crooked collar) with this voice-over: ""Bob’s opponent? Lobbyist Tom Hughes is backed by developers, because he supports paving over thousands of acres of farmland with over-development and sprawl."" Then it lists a number of donations to Hughes: Metropolitan Land Group, $7,500; Maletis Brothers and Langdon Farms, $5,500; Stimson Lumber, $5,000.  

Woah. Parking lots instead of precious farmland? That’s bad. A lobbyist? Even worse.

But wait. 1000 Friends of Oregon -- isn’t that a lobbying group? Clearly, PolitiFact Oregon needs to ferret out the truth.

Hughes is in fact a business lobbyist. He works part time at the law firm Tonkon Torp LLP. ""He assists the group in government relations, the development of public policy and lobbying,"" according to the company’s website. Guilty as charged.  

Before he joined Tonkon Torp early last year, he was Hillsboro’s mayor. Hughes also taught at Aloha High School for nearly 30 years. He was elected to the Hillsboro City Council in 1976, a seat he held until 2000 before segueing into the mayor’s office. Calling him a lobbyist is like identifying Bristol Palin as a ballroom dance contestant.

In PolitiFact Oregon’s view, the label of professional lobbyist in this race belongs to Stacey. He has devoted a good chunk of his career at 1000 Friends of Oregon, first as a longtime staff attorney and then as executive director. In 2007 the advocacy group fought to shore up looser land-use laws approved by voters in 2004. In 2009, he was able to squelch some legislative votes for a major transportation and jobs package because 1000 Friends didn’t think the plan friendly enough to public transit and the climate.

But what about the broader charge, that Hughes is determined to turn thousands of acres of beatific farmland into strip malls, new subdivisions and other supposed horrors?

Stacey’s campaign points to Hughes’ contribution list, to one of his lobbying clients and to statements he has made to the press to conclude that the former mayor is indeed in bed with developers. (Developers generally want to expand the boundary so they can build more, and environmentalists want to keep it tight.)

Let’s dissect.

It’s true Hughes has endorsements and cash contributions from assorted groups interested in work and growth: labor unions, Realtors, business lobbies, garbage haulers and oil companies. But he also has the backing of small city mayors, Gov. Ted Kulongoski, Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian and state House Speaker Dave Hunt, D-Gladstone. And Stacey’s the one with deep pockets in this race: having raised $639,000 this year compared with $408,000 for Hughes. Yamhill County vintner Eric Lemelson has given Stacey’s campaign at least $70,000.

It’s true that Tonkon Torp, Hughes’ firm, represented brothers Chris and Tom Maletis in their attempt to turn farmland south of Wilsonville into urban land fit for a golf club. The effort failed.

It’s true that Hughes, as mayor, signed on to a proposal to ask Metro to add 34,300 acres of new land for future houses, stores and factories in Washington County -- which is way more than the 28,000 acres eventually added for all three counties. But it’s not true that he pushed for 47,000 acres as the Stacey camp alleges -- and that’s because the county committee set to recommend a figure dropped the number from 47,000 acres to 34,300 acres in September 2009. (See nifty timeline here.)

Both Hughes and Stacey support the current long-range Metro plan approved in February 2010, which adds 28,000 acres into urban reserves over the next 40 to 50 years in the three counties. That includes more than 13,000 acres for Washington County, and preserves 272,000 acres for farms and natural areas. 1000 Friends of Oregon has protested the designation as too much for industry.

Hughes has stated repeatedly that he wants to keep the boundary tight. He would, however, consider a run at adding industrial land if the possible payoff was lots of jobs for people. Stacey, on the other hand, wants to focus primarily on developing urban infill that developers say isn’t easy to build on -- like brown sites.

Stacey’s campaign director Brian Rae pointed to a story in The Hillsboro Argus to highlight Hughes’ pro-development stance:
  
Still, he thinks the urban reserves designations earlier this year were too conservative — not in terms of land for jobs, but in terms of the jobs projected. 
""I kind of hope we don't (have enough land in urban reserves) because that projects a job growth that is not very robust,"" he said. 
Hughes is clearly talking about jobs -- not land -- as the reporter notes.

PolitiFact Oregon offers another quote from Hughes, from a 2002 story by The Oregonian, in which Metro proposes adding nearly 200 acres in Hillsboro for high-tech industry.   
Hillsboro risks harming the regional economy if it can't provide new industrial sites, Mayor Tom Hughes said. ""It has to be done carefully, it has to be done thoughtfully, and it doesn't have to be a lot of it,"" he said. ""But it's clear from the case we've made that it has to happen",False,"October 20, 2010"
"Said U.S. Rep. Jim Marshall, D-Macon, sent nearly $2 billion overseas to build wind turbines and create jobs, mostly in China","
Your stimulus money is being shanghaied, Republicans are saying. Literally, it's going to China.

And credit belongs in part to Democratic U.S. Rep. Jim Marshall, according to a recent TV commercial by his Republican opponent, Austin Scott.

The attack claims Marshall, from Macon, voted for the stimulus bill, which ""sent nearly $2 billion overseas to build wind turbines and create jobs, mostly in China.""

U.S. stimulus money went to China? To create jobs there? AJC PolitiFact Georgia took a look.

Marshall spokesman Doug Moore said the claim is wrong.

""There is just no evidence to support the claim that jobs were created in China,"" Moore said.

Marshall and Scott are in one of the state's toughest races. Marshall, the incumbent since 2002, has a record of fending off serious challenges. But this season, Democrats are struggling and victory is far from assured.

Similar accusations about China and wind power are haunting Democratic congressmen in Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, New Mexico, Ohio and Virginia. They, like Marshall, voted for the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009, otherwise known as the stimulus bill.

Republicans are attacking the stimulus because they think it was squandered. And that's where China comes in.

PolitiFact National assessed a similar claim in February on wind turbines and China by former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. She said the stimulus bill was supposed to help create U.S. jobs, but 80 percent of the $2 billion in stimulus dollars spent on alternative energy went to buy wind turbines built in China.

The stimulus did include tax credits and grants to help investors develop wind and other alternative-energy projects in the U.S. But beyond that, Palin's claim fell apart.

Before the stimulus, the federal government gave tax credits to investors in U.S. alternative-energy projects. A program created by the stimulus bill lets the investors get that money up front if they meet certain conditions. But there was no requirement that equipment used in those projects be made in the U.S. or that the investment companies be American-owned.

In October 2009, American University's nonprofit Investigative Reporting Workshop published stories that said much of this program's stimulus money for wind projects ended up in the hands of foreign firms. Although the projects were located in the U.S., many were being built by American subsidiaries of foreign-owned companies, reported Russ Choma, a reporter at the workshop.

In February, the workshop ran additional stories in partnership with ABC News and the Watchdog Institute at San Diego State University. By that time, about 79 percent of the $2.1 billion given to wind-energy companies had gone to foreign ones.

So Palin's claim did address a real controversy, but she misrepresented it.

Some of the stimulus money supports jobs abroad because turbine parts are often made overseas. But many are made by U.S. companies or made by foreign companies in the U.S. Not a single recipient of program money is owned by a Chinese company.

Back to Scott's commercial, which makes a claim that's slightly different from Palin's. It said that the stimulus sent nearly $2 billion overseas to build turbines and create jobs, mostly in China.

There are a few problems with this accusation.

The first is that it uses the $2 billion figure incorrectly. The amount, which is from the February stories, was the total for wind grants -- including domestic ones. About 79 percent of that money went to foreign-owned companies.

Secondly, the $2 billion number is outdated. Because claims about jobs in China and wind turbines began to re-emerge recently, Choma posted updated stimulus figures Sept. 27. on the workshop website.

Major wind farm projects in the U.S. received $4.4 billion worth of grants under the program, according to more recent calculations based on U.S. Department of Energy numbers. About $2.38 billion, or 54 percent, has gone to foreign-owned developers.

Third, the commercial's claim that the $2 billion got sent ""overseas"" is well short of correct. Although equipment was made overseas and foreign companies were involved, much of the money was also spent domestically. Every one of the projects was located in the U.S., and some of the turbines were manufactured here.

How much money stayed here? Experts said it's difficult to tell. But the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California used Energy Department funds to study the grant program's impact, including its effect on jobs.

The lab's calculations were rough, early estimates based on limited information and do not take into account nonwind-energy jobs lost because of the program. But its economic model showed wind projects funded by the grant program created or retained more than 55,400 domestic jobs, most of them short-term.

If the project were entirely domestic, it would have created more than 87,000 jobs, the report said. However, this was not possible. The U.S. does not have the capability to manufacture enough wind turbines, it noted.

Another estimate based on research from the Renewable Energy Policy Project, which has been critical of how the Obama administration handled the stimulus grants, indicates the projects created a total of 35,000 jobs.

But it's not clear how many jobs would be overseas. Too few are domestic, the group said, and the program doesn't do enough to foster the development of U.S. wind turbine manufacturing.

Unlike the lab's calculations, the REPP number does not include ""induced"" jobs, or jobs supported when workers and firms spend the money they make.

Regardless, these job estimates indicate money did stay in the U.S. Although turbine manufacturing does take place overseas, some takes place domestically, and the construction and operation of the sites take place in the U.S.

And finally, the most important problem with Scott's claim is China. It's barely a factor in this debate.

A wind industry trade group that's been critical of how Choma and others portray the issue confirmed that only three turbines were purchased outright from China. Not a single company that received these funds is owned by a Chinese company.

""When we talk about money going overseas, it's going to Europe,"" Choma said.

So while the green-energy grants did end up in the hands of foreign companies, the situation is far from what Scott's commercial claimed.

The $2 billion figure is old and incorrect. Even critics agree that money is staying in the country in the form of domestic construction and manufacturing jobs, though the amount is unclear and most jobs are short-term.

It's not possible for domestic manufacturers to produce all the wind turbines because they don't have enough capacity. And the overseas jobs in question are mostly in Europe, not China",False,"October 19, 2010"
"Says Christopher Little has ""a history of working against environmental protection by defending the worst types of corporate polluters""","
Christopher H. Little, the Moderate Party’s candidate for attorney general, has tried to position himself as the candidate with the best experience to clean up Rhode Island’s politics and environment. Among other credentials, he cites his past chairmanship of Common Cause of Rhode Island and his three years as president of Save the Bay, beginning in 1987.

So it was no surprise that someone might try to sully his Mr. Clean persona. Earlier this month, state Democratic Party Chairman Edwin R. Pacheco said Little’s claim to being an environmental champion was contaminated by his private law work for polluters.

""Attorney general candidate Chris Little and his law firm have a history of working against environmental protection by defending the worst type of corporate polluters,"" Pacheco said in an Oct. 4 news release.

Little dismissed Pacheco’s charges, saying ""Mr. Pacheco, you need to actually read these cases you’re citing. If you do you will find that I was actually trying to help preserve the environment.""

An open invitation to look at the record. How could we refuse?

Pacheco cites three instances in which he claims Little represented clients who were polluters:

* Two Massachusetts towns that took the federal Environmental Protection Agency to court over a proposed sludge  dump

* A chemical company whose North Carolina facility was designated a hazardous waste site

* A Massachusetts-based gasoline station operator that was fined for a gasoline spill in Brockton

We’ll look at them one-by-one.

The EPA suit

Pacheco’s first claim involves the Massachusetts towns of Walpole and Norfolk, which challenged a 1989 federal Environmental Protection Agency study that said it was environmentally safe to build a landfill for dried sewage sludge in Walpole.

Pacheco’s news release said the EPA found ""the towns violated water pollution laws. … Chris Little was on the side of polluters and lost.""

That case stemmed from the 1980s effort to clean up Boston Harbor. New filtration plants were built to purify sewage effluent before it was discharged into the harbor. But the new plants generated sludge, which had to be dumped somewhere. In 1989, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority decided that somewhere was in Walpole, near the Norfolk town line.

The towns objected and sued the EPA, claiming the EPA’s environmental impact study failed to address environmental threats the landfill would pose.

Little — who was with Tillinghast, Collins & Graham at the time — said he joined the effort in 1989 or 1990 on Norfolk’s behalf, after he’d represented the Rhode Island town of Richmond in its successful fight to stop a 70-acre landfill from being built there.

A federal district court judge ruled for the EPA, finding that the agency had considered the issues and met the federal standards for an impact study.

In the end, the dump was never built. In 1993, after lobbying by the state, the EPA agreed to a plan to have the dried sludge trucked to dumps in Utah.

Pacheco bases his criticism of Little on a summary of the suit on LexisNexis, an Internet data base, which said ""the EPA found that the towns had violated the Water Pollution Control Act...""

However, the judge’s decision shows that summary was inaccurate. Rather than violating water pollution control laws, the towns were trying to get them enforced more stringently. In fact, the ruling shows it was Little’s client who sought tougher environmental law enforcement.

The North Carolina company

Pacheco's news release said: In 1988, Little's law firm continued their quest against environmental protection when his firm defended a company that had a history of contaminating drinking water supplies.""

That company was National Starch and Chemical, a North Carolina firm that makes chemicals for textile and furniture makers.

Pacheco’s statement cites a 1980s case in which National Starch was cited for storing 350,000 gallons of liquid waste in unlined trenches on its property. Because of the threat to local drinking water wells, the EPA ordered it to clean up the site.

Little did represent National Starch, but it was in a case in Rhode Island, not North Carolina.

National Starch was among several companies that used a New Jersey company to dispose of their waste.

The companies thought their waste was going to an incinerator in New Jersey, but instead it was taken to Rhode Island, where it was illegally dumped at the Davis site in Smithfield, later designated as a Superfund site.

The company agreed to pay $5 million toward the cleanup; Little represented it in subsequent lawsuits to recover that money from the disposal company that misled it.

Little maintains his work for National Starch wasn’t to defend a polluter but to make sure the real guilty party paid financially.

The oil company

Pacheco’s third claim involved legal work Little did for gasoline station owner Mutual Oil of Massachusetts. His news release says Mutual Oil was fined $50,000 by the state for spilling gasoline at a station it owned in Brockton, a claim we verified through the Massachusetts attorney general’s report for fiscal year 2002.

Little did represent Mutual Oil, but not in that case. Instead, it was in a Rhode Island zoning dispute. In 1999 a developer wanted to build a gas station in a Stop & Shop shopping center on Mendon Road, in Cumberland, near the Blackstone River.

A group of local gas station owners that wanted to stop a new competitor convinced the zoning board to reject the plan, in part because the gas station would have been built on a floodplain of the Blackstone River. Little said Mutual Oil financed his work on behalf of the local station owners.

To summarize:

Pacheco was wrong when he said Little ""was on the side of the polluters"" in the Massachusetts sludge case.

He was correct when he said Little represented a North Carolina company that caused pollution problems in that state. But Little’s representation of the company had nothing to do with that case.

He was correct when he said a Little client had been fined for a spill in Massachusetts. But again, Little’s representation of the company had nothing to do with that spill.

Bottom line: None of the cases Pacheco cites supports his attack on Little",False,"October 19, 2010"
"Debbie Jackow ""unlike her opponent ... WILL NOT de-fund the 20/20 land program.""","
Lab tech and political newcomer Debbie Jackow's campaign mailer touts what she is not. She is not her opponent, two-term incumbent Lee County Commissioner Tammy Hall.

Jackow lists her bulleted campaign promises under the header, ""Unlike her opponent Debbie WILL NOT..."" 

• Be a tax and spend commissioner

• Raise property taxes

• Be owned by special interests

• De-fund the 20/20 land program

That last line about the county's Conservation 20/20 program caught our attention.

We wondered, is that a fair accusation?

Voters approved the 20/20 land program in a 1996 referendum to help the county buy up and exempt environmentally sensitive land from development. The program taxes 50 cents for every $1,000 of assessed property value. In 14 years, Lee County taxpayers have spent $286.5 million to preserve 37 square miles of land.

Hall has always voted to approve funding for the program. She voted for it again this year, and it's approved through 2011. We looked for evidence to support Jackow's claim that Hall planned in the future to pull funds from Conservation 20/20.

We pulled footage from the July 6, 2010, commission meeting where commissioners voted to fund the program. This meeting and the media's coverage of it, Jackow said, were the basis of her accusation.

Clerk of Court Charlie Green suggested at the start of the meeting that the commission divert $27 million from Conservation 20/20 this year ­to help fill the county's budget deficit. Hall's only response was to invite Green to stay at the meeting through the vote on the 14-year-old program.

Two hours into the meeting, Hall thanked Commissioner Ray Judah for his support of Conservation 20/20. She then said, ""I support, I have always supported the (Conservation) 20/20 program.""

She led a unanimous vote to continue funding the program.

So where did Jackow's accusation come from?

""It was in The News-Press,"" Jackow said. ""(Hall) said she would consider touching the 20/20 money.""

A July 7 News-Press article said, ""Commission Chairwoman Tammy Hall said the board should be looking ahead to further cost-cutting measures. She cited Clerk of Court Charlie Green's idea of putting a halt to the county's land conservation purchasing program and using its tax dollars to help plug the budget hole.""

A look at the meeting footage shows Hall suggesting the county continue to make cuts. Without expressing support for Green's idea, she also states, ""The clerk has given us ideas on how to maybe put things on hold and transfer over, but that is our goal ... that the average citizen in Lee County does not see a tax increase.""

Hall offered no further comment on Green's suggestion during the meeting.

Hall has supported Conservation 20/20 every year she's been in office, including the current year. To say Hall is considering de-funding the program would be a stretch. Saying she has de-funded the program is clearly incorrect",False,"October 10, 2010"
"""It takes as much energy to make a solar panel as it likely generates in its entire life.""","
The Florida solar rebate debate begs for a little sunshine.

The state owes Floridians $52.7 million in unpaid solar energy rebates. But lawmakers recently ignored Gov. Charlie Crist’s request to tap federal stimulus money to dent the backlog.

Senate budget chief J.D. Alexander, R-Lake Wales, told a St. Petersburg Times reporter, ""It takes as much energy to make a solar panel as it likely generates in its entire life. I really doubt that this is a good investment for the people of Florida.""

His energy payback claim caught some eyes — and ours.

Steve Plice quickly e-mailed PolitiFact Florida. To the president of Tampa Bay Living Green, a nonprofit that teaches about environmental sustainability, Alexander’s claim stuck out. ""Could you please check this?"" he asked. ""I have seen estimates for the energy payback period ranging from 18 months to 11 years. Solar panels are expected to last 20-30 years, so Mr. Alexander's claims would seem to be very wrong.""

As Plice suggests, this isn’t unexplored territory. For years, energy payback studies have examined how much energy it takes to manufacture, install and operate various kinds of solar panels, also referred to as photovoltaic modules or arrays. The idea is, a solar panel should capture more energy over its lifetime than it saps. Otherwise, as Alexander notes, one would hardly be a ""good investment.""

We asked Alexander for support for his comments. He sent a link to a solar energy payback study he thought we ""may find helpful."" And did we ever.

The study published by Energy Bulletin, an online clearinghouse of news and analysis, did, indeed, address Alexander’s claim. It mentioned the most commonly cited — and ""possibly the only"" — study that says the energy payback time on a solar panel may exceed its lifetime. The Energy Bulletin authors hadn’t found any published studies that reference the work, a 1996 book by Howard Odum called Environmental Accounting. They did note the popularity of Odum’s analysis on Web forums. Then they explain why Odum’s findings can be rejected.

The Energy Bulletin authors, who reviewed other published work to reach wider conclusions about roof-mounted solar panel systems — a type a Florida homeowner might install — concluded the systems would generate enough electricity to cover their energy debt in two to eight years, and turn sunlight into energy for at least 25 years.

So, they wrote in 2006, the systems ""have a positive energy payback and are capable of contributing to a sustainable energy future.""

Alexander’s own link debunks his claim. But we were ready to examine other evidence, just in case.

In 1975, the Florida Legislature created the Florida Solar Energy Center to research, test and certify solar systems and develop education programs. Dr. James Fenton, a professor of mechanical, materials and aerospace engineering, directs the institute at the University of Central Florida.

Fenton pointed us to a study published two years later than Alexander’s that focuses on emissions from the life cycle of photovoltaic cells, and makes references to multiple energy payback studies. It explains that the life cycle of a photovoltaic system starts with mining quartz sand or metal ore, depending on the type of system, which then has to be purified and turned into silicon wafers or thin film. That takes a lot of energy, right?

Sure, but only as much as is generated by solar systems in three to six years, and sometimes as little as a year or so, especially in sunnier climates, the study summarizes.

The U.S. Department of Energy also weighs in on the topic, through a PV FAQs explainer piece called ""What is the energy payback for PV?"" produced by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. No good news for Alexander’s claim here. Instead, the FAQ says, ""Based on models and real data, the idea that PV (photovoltaics) cannot pay back its energy investment is simply a myth.""

It concludes that for an investment of one to four years worth of energy output, rooftop systems can provide 30 years or more of clean energy.

Other studies sent our way reached similar conclusions.

Now, when Alexander provided us with the Energy Bulletin study, he explained in support of his claim that ""the answer really depends on so many variables that are often difficult to control"" such as materials used to create a solar panel, the type of solar system and where it is located. (He noted that ""obviously some parts of the country get a lot more sunlight and cloud cover than others."" Perhaps he forgot he’s a lawmaker in Florida, the Sunshine State.)

""Given best materials and optimal conditions,"" he wrote, ""there clearly can be energy payback in two to eight years. Given other conditions, the answer is there will not be payback. So, the real answer is it depends on many factors, which is true for all things involving green/clean technologies.""

Sounds reasonable, right? The only problem is that the study he points to, and others, attempt to control for those variables — and make allowances for them. That’s why the ranges are so wide: from one to four years, or from two to eight. And Alexander’s claim doesn’t contain nearly the flexibility of his followup explanation. He said: ""It takes as much energy to make a solar panel as it likely generates in its entire life."" 
By saying ""as it likely generates in its entire life,"" Alexander suggests that he's talking about a typical example of solar panel output, not a fringe case with undefined ""other conditions.""

Thus, our ruling. Alexander’s own evidence says his view ""can be rejected,"" and a mainstream consumer publication call it ""simply a myth."" But he uses this long-debunked claim to help justify rejecting $13.9 million in federal funds for Floridians",False Pants on Fire,"September 28, 2010"
"""We've got to find 2 billion gallons (of water per day) between now and 2025.""","
Republican Agriculture Commissioner candidate Adam Putnam is sounding the alarm about a critical water shortage he says Florida will soon be facing.

""The most important issue facing Florida long term is water -- whether you want to plant an orange grove, build a subdivision, save the Everglades ... it all boils down to water,"" Putnam, a congressman from Bartow in Polk County, said on Sept. 9, 2010, during an editorial board interview with the St. Petersburg Times.

""We've got to find 2 billion -- find, create, make, obtain through conservation -- 2 billion gallons (of water) between now and 2025. Per day."" 
Putnam told the editorial board members assembled that the state needs to invest in alternative water supplies like reclaimed water, and create incentives for developers to invest in alternative supplies as well. The state must also advocate for more conservation and efficiency measures, Putnam said, and continue to invest in desalination facilities -- which turn salt water into drinking water.

He wrote a policy position paper on the state's water supply issues, which you can read here.

In this fact check we're drilling down on Putnam's basic assumption, that Florida needs to somehow develop an additional 2 billion gallons of water per day in the next 15 years. 
We turned to the state Department of Environmental Protection, the agency tasked to increase the state's available water supplies, for an answer.

Florida used an estimated 6.9 billion gallons of fresh water per day in 2005, the DEP said, citing the most recent U.S. Geological Survey report. By 2025, it is projected that the state will use 8.7 billion gallons a day. That's an increase of 1.8 billion gallon per day, or 27 percent. Close to what Putnam said. 
We should note that the projected is based on the assumption that the state's population will grow to almost 25 million by 2025. Currently, the state's population is estimated to be around 18.77 million. The projection also assumes that the government will be responsible for providing water for everyone in the state. Both those assumptions could, of course, change between now and 2025. 
""As Florida continues to grow, pressure is put on the water resources of the state and the need to ensure these resources are available for future generations becomes increasingly important,"" the state wrote in its 2010 Annual Report on Regional Water Supply Planning. ""Floridians have always enjoyed a quality of life that is inextricably linked to the health of our water resources. Tourists come here to enjoy pristine beaches, swim in our freshwater springs, and experience unique fishing opportunities. Florida's water resources also support large agricultural industries. If Florida did not maintain its high quality natural systems, the effects would be felt throughout the entire economy."" 
To be sure, the DEP and the state's five water management districts have been preparing for the uptick. The water management districts are required by law to develop and update regional water supply plans every five years.

And they have already identified, developed or are developing projects to help close the gap.

In 2005, the Legislature created the Water Protection and Sustainability Trust Fund and designated $100 million to be used to promote the development of alternative water supplies. The state set aside another $117 million over three years in 2006, 2007 and 2008. The Legislature stopped funding the program in 2009, the DEP said.

The investment, however, helped water management districts provide funding assistance for 327 water saving projects, which will help create approximately 761 million gallons a day of ""new water"" available for consumptive use. That's close to 40 percent of the water expected to be needed by 2025.

Most of the projects focus on adding reclaimed water capacity or demineralizing brackish groundwater.

The work already being done by the state and water management districts is an important caveat when considering Putnam's comments because he makes it sound like the state has to find 2 billion gallons of water a day by 2025. In reality, the state already has projects on the book that get the state a portion of the way there.

Yet, Florida has a ways to go. 
Putnam is right, based on the latest estimates Florida will use about 2 billion more gallons of water a day in 2025 than the state did in 2005. But the state and the five state water management districts have started planning for it, and already have identified water construction projects that will help meet some of the increasing demand",Mostly True,"September 10, 2010"
"""I’m the only one who's fought against developers draining the Everglades!""","
In his first television ad of the general election, released on Sept. 7, 2010, U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek tries to distinguish himself from his fellow Senate hopefuls, Republican Marco Rubio and the independent candidate, Gov. Charlie Crist.

The clip opens with Meek stepping into an airboat and zipping around the Everglades – an image that screams Florida. In his first claim on the 33-second video ""Only One,"" Meek boasts of being ""the only one who's fought against developers draining the Everglades!"" The ad goes on through a litany of claims: ""The only one against drilling before and after the BP spill. The only one against privatizing Social Security. The only one who's pro-choice, who took on George Bush, who's fought for middle-class tax cuts, against high credit card fees, and to raise the minimum wage.""

Such a wealth of fact-checking opportunities! We decided to start at the top, saving the Everglades. It seemed like such a bold claim that it warranted a closer look. 
We asked the Meek campaign to show us the proof that its candidate could lay claim to such bragging rights. Meek spokesman Adam Sharon noted that the Democratic contender had voted in favor of a 2007 bill that set aside funding for water resource construction and improvement projects, including $687.07 million for Everglades restoration. The Meek campaign also cited $135 million that Meek helped secure for Everglades Restoration in fiscal years 2009. These measures are clearly pro-Everglades but do they do much to keep developers out of the Everglades? We didn't see anything in the bills, and neither do others. 
""It has nothing to do with any restrictions on development in Florida,"" said Kirk Fordham, chief executive officer of the Everglades Foundation in Washington, D.C. 
Clearly, Meek is referring to his actions on federal legislation, and it isn't exactly a fair comparison. Former House Speaker Rubio and Gov. Crist aren't in the same position to vote; after all, they aren't federal lawmakers. ""They didn't vote in the same body so you can't compare their voting records,"" said Fordham.

Just as we had asked the Meek campaign to show us how he single-handedly stopped developers from draining the Everglades, we asked Crist and Rubio whether they've done anything to help the Everglades.

Crist spokesman Danny Kanner quickly pointed to the governor's 2009 bid to buy out U.S. Sugar Corp. and convert its 180,000-plus acres to reservoirs and pollution-treatment marshes. The original plan with its $1.75 billion price tag has since been scaled back to $197 million and 26,800 acres, but a new deal gives the South Florida Water Management District options to buy all or part of the land for up to 10 years.

Everglades advocates such as Fordham and Thom Rumberger, chairman of the Everglades Trust in Tallahassee, also point out that Crist has made key appointments favorable to the environment. Fordham noted how Crist -- compared to his developer-friendly predecessor, Jeb Bush -- appointed pro-environment types to the governing board of the South Florida Water Management District including Shannon Estenoz, Sandy Batchelor and Kevin Powers. Crist has also received some green recognition, including a ""Champion of the Everglades"" award in 2008 from Audubon of Florida.

As the Meek campaign was quick to point out, Crist signed Senate Bill 2080 in 2009, which stripped the water board's authority over issuing consumptive use permits and gave it to the board’s directors, a move that prevented the public from making decisions on who gets water, how much and from where. ""Everglades restoration depends on reducing the quantity of water taken from the environment,"" Audubon of Florida said in a statement May 21, 2009, that urged Crist to veto the bill.

Still, ""It would be hard to argue that Meek has a superior record to the governor,"" said Fordham, a major backer of the U.S. Sugar deal. ""I know Crist has a pretty solid record on protecting and restoring the Everglades.""

For his part, Rubio voted when he was in the House in favor of a 2008 bill that authorized issuing bonds for Everglades restoration. It also doubled the maximum annual issuance amount from $100 million to $200 million.

""The real work on the Everglades was being done at that time on the Senate side,"" said Eric Draper, executive director of the Audubon of Florida. ""The House was more in a position of going along. I would characterize (Rubio) as going along, not as providing leadership.""

For Meek to claim he is the only one among the three to stop developers from draining the Everglades is decidedly not true. The Meek campaign cited bills he backed as evidence that he was pro-Everglades, but neither of the two bills stopped developers from draining the Everglades. Similarly, Crist and Rubio have also taken steps to back measures that support Everglades restoration",False,"September 10, 2010"
"Proposed tax changes are a ""handout"" to BP.","On Sept. 2, 2010, the National Taxpayers Union -- a conservative advocacy group -- announced that it would be spending $4 million on an advertising campaign that targets higher energy taxes. Here's the narration of the TV ad: ""Our economy's hurting, but some senators want to weaken an industry creating jobs. America's energy industry supports 9 million jobs, but Congress may double-tax U.S. energy companies, helping foreign companies owned by China and Venezuela, even BP. New taxes will raise your gas prices, make us more dependent on foreign oil, and cost 600,000 American jobs. Tell Congress BP doesn't deserve a handout. No new American energy taxes."" At first, we thought this was an ad decrying the Democratic cap-and-trade proposal, a legislative effort to cap greenhouse gases that Republicans have consistently criticized as a tax on ordinary energy consumers. But that's not what the ad is about. Instead, NTU says the ad is about two changes under consideration by the Obama administration and the Democratic Congress -- rules for ""dual capacity"" taxpayers, and the Section 199 deduction. The ad is correct that the modifications being considered would primarily affect oil and gas companies. Even by the byzantine standards of tax law, these rules are highly arcane. So bear with us as we try to explain how they work and investigate whether the ad portrays them fairly. Our aim is to gauge whether the ad is accurate when it says that making these changes would amount to a ""handout"" to companies like BP. Let's start with the ""dual capacity"" rule. This rule stems from a tax code provision that lets U.S. taxpayers receive credit for taxes paid on income derived overseas, so income is not taxed twice. Say you're a U.S. oil company. You go to a foreign country to extract oil. You pay a 20 percent tax to that country on what you extract. When your U.S. taxes are calculated, you'll get a dollar-for-dollar credit for the taxes paid overseas. Where it starts getting complicated is that some foreign countries charge oil extractors a single payment that includes both the tax and a payment for the right to drill in the first place. So, rather than paying 20 percent tax on what's extracted, the company will have to pay more, because the rights to drill are included in the same levy. (The dual nature of these payments is the origin of the term ""dual capacity."") Whether the company considers this a tax or a royalty payment matters quite a bit for the U.S. company's tax bill because amounts considered to be foreign taxes provide dollar-for-dollar reductions in tax liability, whereas a royalty only permits a deduction, which is a significantly smaller tax benefit than dollar-for-dollar. So, the greater the amount that's considered a foreign tax, the larger the sum that can be deducted from U.S. taxes. Current U.S. tax law deals with this by trying to determine what part is the true tax (and thus eligible for a dollar-for-dollar tax credit) and what is being paid by the company for a specific economic benefit, such as the right to drill (which is only deductible as a business expense). This is a fairly easy process if the foreign country has a straightforward corporate tax structure. But it gets complicated if the country either taxes ""dual capacity"" taxpayers at a different rate than other corporate taxpayers or if it has no basic corporate tax rate at all. In such cases, U.S. companies have more flexibility to call the payments they've made ""taxes"" -- too much flexibility for some critics, who argue that it's an unnecessary loophole that drains the U.S. Treasury of taxes. That's why President Barack Obama, in his fiscal year 2011 budget, and some senators have proposed tightening the rules. We won't get into the guts of the proposed changes here, but the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress' official, non-partisan arbiter of tax policy changes, found that Obama's proposal would collect an additional $8.2 billion between 2010 and 2020. Oil and gas companies aren't the only sector that would be affected, but they are the main companies that will. Now for the second proposal -- eliminating oil and gas companies as beneficiaries of Section 199 of the tax code.  Section 199 is a deduction for companies that produce goods or software or undertake construction projects in the U.S. Passed in 2004, it replaced a previous tax benefit extended specifically to U.S. exporters, struck down as an illegal trade subsidy by the World Trade Organization. Under section 199, U.S. oil and gas companies can take advantage of a lower tax rate. According to Treasury Department testimony in 2009, making oil and gas ineligible is projected to increase federal revenues by $13.2 billion from 2010 to 2019. We won't address the ad's claim that these proposals could result in the elimination of 600,000 jobs, higher gasoline prices or greater dependence on foreign oil, since such estimates are speculative and ultimately not provable. Instead, we'll focus on whether the ad is justified in calling such changes a ""handout"" to BP or other foreign companies.

In the ad's defense, the changes would only affect U.S.-based companies, and by taking away a benefit from a U.S. firm, the government could, in a sense, be advantaging foreign-based firms.

Pete Sepp, NTU's executive vice president, said that the two tax provisions were created to take the sting off the U.S. corporate tax code. Because many of the United States' competitors do not tax the foreign earnings of domestic firms -- but we do -- deductions and exemptions like the two in question here help U.S. competitiveness. ""Taking away one or both these provisions for oil companies -- provisions that exist for a wide variety of firms -- will, in our opinion, necessarily increase the overhead of oil and gas firms (based) here. That means higher costs for those firms -- costs which foreign-based competitors like BP don't have to shoulder.""

Still, ""handout"" is a pretty strong word to describe what's being proposed. In Webster's New World Dictionary, the relevant definition of ""handout"" is ""a gift of food, clothing, etc., as to a beggar."" Allowing for some artistic license to exchange ""BP"" for ""beggar,"" we think the accuracy of ""handout"" depends on whether the government is affirmatively providing a direct benefit to BP. And it's not clear that the government would be doing this if it made these changes.

If the government were to pass these two policy proposals, it would certainly be taking away a benefit granted to U.S.-based oil and gas companies. But would taking away the two benefits from U.S. companies be equivalent to giving a handout to BP? We're not so sure.

Mitchell Kane, a professor at New York University Law School who specializes in international corporate taxation, said the use of the term ""handout"" in this context is ""highly misleading,"" noting that there would be no change at all to BP's tax liability. ""There could be competitive effects, but this is a highly speculative claim, and in any event is not what most people think of as a handout,"" Kane said. ""If your co-worker loses her job, and there is therefore less competition in the company for promotions and future raises, does this mean you have received a 'handout?'""

There's another reason to question whether BP's British owners are the only ones who would benefit if these provisions were to pass. In a globalized economy, some Americans would actually benefit, since foreign companies employ, do business with and pay quarterly dividends to lots of U.S. taxpayers. According to BP's website, it is the largest oil and gas producer and one of the largest gasoline retailers in the United States, as well as the largest non-U.S. company traded on the New York Stock Exchange. And U.S.-based subsidiaries of foreign companies, including BP's U.S. subsidiaries, qualify for Section 199 credits, which weakens the argument that BP would be a clear winner if these changes were made.

It's certainly understandable that U.S. oil companies doing business overseas would be opposed to these proposals -- and perhaps feel picked on, since both changes specifically target their industry. Still, we think the term ""handout"" in this context is questionable -- even hypocritical, since the tax policy the oil companies want to keep in place could easily be described as involving longstanding ""handouts"" for them",Half True,"September 10, 2010"
"Georgia's U.S. senators voted for legislation that would ""gut clean air protections and increase oil dependence.""","
Are Georgia's two U.S. senators too beholden to ""Big Oil"" companies?

That's the claim on a website created by Oil Change International, critical about the positions of some U.S. senators on some oil and energy issues. The site, www.bobbinginpetroleum.org, has images of 46 senators, including Georgia's Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson.

Make no mistake, Oil Change International has an agenda. It identifies itself on its website as ""a research and advocacy organization that exists to force progress in the energy industry towards an environmentally and socially sustainable energy future."" The website also proclaims that the tax-exempt organization ""campaigns to expose the true costs of oil and facilitate the coming transition towards clean energy. We are dedicated to identifying and overcoming political barriers to that transition.""

The website says Chambliss and Isakson have accepted a combined $331,000 in what it dubbed ""dirty energy contributions."" The largest contributor, about $128,000, was Atlanta-based Southern Co.

For visual effect, the heads and torsos of the two senators are floating in rubber duckies in oil-stained water. An oil barrel is in the background.

AJC PolitiFact Georgia certainly could not ignore an opportunity to dive deeper into this website. We also wanted to know if Chambliss and Isakson voted for legislation that ""gut clear air protections and increase oil dependence.""

We reached out to the offices of both senators to see if they disputed the claims against their bosses. Both defended their votes in favor of legislation the website criticized. Isakson's Senate seat is up for re-election on Nov. 2.

We decided to dig deeper into the claim about the resolution, since the staff of both senators seemed to have a larger beef with that.

The legislation in question was written by U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska. It aimed to prevent the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from formulating regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The first of the new regulations could take effect in 2011. Murkowski argued Congress needs more input in the process, but her bill failed by a 53 to 47 vote. If Murkowski's resolution had been approved, some activists argued it would have a negative impact on clean air regulations. Bobbing in Petroleum called the legislation the ""Big Oil Bailout.""

Chambliss and Isakson argued in support of the legislation largely on economic grounds. The legislation was a skirmish in the ongoing battle in Washington over efforts to pass sweeping energy legislation. The House passed a bill last year to establish a cap on carbon emissions, but the legislation has run into firm opposition in the Senate. Many Republican leaders say the so-called ""cap and trade"" legislation would become a job-killing tax. Pass the legislation, they argue, and you put Americans out of work.

""This backdoor attempt to regulate greenhouse gases will have dramatic negative effects on our manufacturing sector while also causing significant increases in the cost of power generation,"" Isakson said in a statement after the June 10 vote.

Chambliss said in a speech on the Senate floor that day that the EPA's actions would require more cash-strapped farmers to get federal Clean Air Act permits, hurting many of them financially.

So would the Murkowski bill ""gut clean air protections and increase oil dependence""?

First, we must go back to 2007. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 vote that the EPA must consider putting controls on carbon dioxide and other gases in automobile exhaust. The majority rejected arguments by the administration of then-President George W. Bush, a Republican, that the Clean Air Act does not treat carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases as ""pollutants,"" and thus does not give the EPA the authority to regulate them.

In September 2009, the EPA, under the administration of President Barack Obama, a Democrat, announced plans to require better gas mileage for cars and trucks and the first-ever rules on vehicle greenhouse gas emissions. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson wants to establish a greenhouse gas emission for cars and light trucks in model years 2012 to 2016.

Murkowski introduced her legislation in January to stop the EPA effort.

Stephen Kretzmann, who created the Bobbing in Petroleum site, said the EPA regulations would reduce automotive oil consumption by more than 1.8 billion barrels, citing comments Jackson made in a statement to a House of Representatives energy subcommittee.

""Eliminating the EPA standard would forfeit ... one-third of its greenhouse gas emissions reductions,"" Jackson said.

Kretzmann also noted a letter by former EPA Administrator Russell Train urging the Senate to vote down the Murkowski bill. Train said the legislation would roll back Clean Air Act protections.

""If Congress had removed EPA's ability to regulate greenhouse gases, industry would have been on more solid ground to challenge them in the future. And I have no doubt that they will, if given the chance,"" said Kretzmann, who said he's worked on energy and oil issues for nearly two decades.
 
Jonas Monast, who has expertise in federal climate protection policies, agreed Murkowski's legislation would adversely impact the EPA's ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. However, he said it would not impact U.S. Department of Transportation's ability to increase vehicle efficiency, a point that's been made by other nonpartisan observers. Cars, buses and trucks account for about half of all cancers attributed to outdoor sources of air toxins, federal officials say. The EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are working on a new rating system that rates the overall fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions of different vehicles to help consumers before buying a new car, SUV, truck or van.

Would the bill increase oil dependence?

""I don't think it's possible to predict at this point,"" said Monast, senior policy counsel at the Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Studies at Duke University.

Obama announced in May a plan to impose mileage and pollution limits on vehicles, particularly SUVs and trucks. Obama used the BP oil spill to highlight the need to rely less on fossil fuels. The EPA argued Murkowski's resolution would hurt the president's plan and continue America's dependence on foreign oil. Murkowski argued her resolution would not impact the federal Department of Transportation's ability to regulate fuel efficiency.

Every expert we talked to said the Murkowski legislation would hurt the EPA's efforts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. But the experts also said it would not impact federal transportation officials from moving forward with efforts to increase vehicle efficiency. Whether or not the bill would increase oil dependence is still debatable",Half True,"September 7, 2010"
"Ron Johnson is ""willing to hand over the Great Lakes to the oil companies.""","
As in the Gulf of Mexico, oil just won’t disappear from the U.S. Senate race in Wisconsin.

It’s a central part of an ad by U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, a Democrat locked in a tough re-election battle. Not only does the ad argue that Republican Ron Johnson wants to drill for oil in the Great Lakes, it says he’s ""willing to hand over the Great Lakes to the oil companies.""

For lake-loving Wisconsinites, the issue hits home.

The charge goes back to a statement that bubbled up when Johnson sat down for a wide-ranging interview with Wispolitics.com. Johnson, an Oshkosh businessman, was asked this question:

""Would you support more drilling in the U.S., continental, Great Lakes for example, if there was oil found there, and more exploration in Alaska, those kind of things?""

Johnson’s answer: ""The bottom line is, we are an oil based economy and there’s nothing we’re going to do to get off of that for many, many years. So we have to be realistic and recognize that fact. We have to get the oil where it is, but we need to do it responsibly, we need to utilize American ingenuity and American technology to make sure we to do it environmentally sensitively and safely.""

That’s where it began.

This is where it wound up:

The Feingold campaign issued a news release June 18 that said, ""when asked if he would support drilling in the Great Lakes, Johnson said: ‘I think we have to get the oil where it is.’ "" The release prompted some chatter in the blogosphere, though the issue remained low on the public radar screen.

And the Johnson campaign remained silent.

Then came Feingold’s TV ad. It showed a map of the United States and graphically transplanted the BP oil spill from the Gulf of Mexico to Lake Michigan shores. Meanwhile, Feingold is heard saying Johnson is ""willing to hand over the Great Lakes to the oil companies, threatening Wisconsin’s economy and a way of life for generations of Wisconsin families.""

To hear Feingold, one would think BP was ready to plop an oil rig just off the Summerfest grounds. So, we figured it was time for us to do a little drilling of our own to see if Feingold  hit the mark.

There is little doubt Johnson, a BP shareholder, has a ""Drill, baby, drill"" attitude. On Oct. 10, 2009 -- before he was a candidate -- Johnson told a tea party gathering in Oshkosh: ""I want oil companies to make enough money to continue to explore, drill, refine, and deliver gas to virtually every corner of America.""

That would presumably include the Great Lakes.

But Johnson’s campaign issued a statement July 12, four weeks after the Wispolitics.com interview, that left no wiggle room. It said: ""I would reject any and all efforts to drill in the Great Lakes.""

That statement was issued at 3:49 p.m., the day before the Feingold ad was launched. John Kraus, senior strategist for Feingold’s campaign, said the Johnson statement was issued about an hour after the Feingold campaign made its TV buy.

Coincidence, or was Johnson tipped off about the Feingold ad? You decide.

Johnson quickly launched his own response ad, which said in part: ""Ron Johnson opposes drilling in the Great Lakes and Russ Feingold knows it."" And Johnson and his campaign later argued there’s not enough oil in the lake to make drilling worthwhile and that it was too cold to do much drilling here anyway. Finally, six weeks after his initial response Johnson said he may have not heard ""Great Lakes"" included in the question.

In other words, it’s kind of a gooey mess.

Let’s clean it all up.

Feingold took an off-the-cuff statement by Johnson -- albeit one Johnson had a month to correct -- and made it the centerpiece of a TV ad that launched the day after Johnson had re-framed his views.   

Johnson has noted his support for more oil exploration. But the ad made a flat hand-the-lakes-over statement, ignoring Johnson’s expressed concerns for the environment. That’s not handing the lakes over to Big Oil. It was produced based on the original Johnson statement, but the ad remained on the air long after Johnson clearly said no to Great Lakes drilling. And Feingold is continuing to state on the campaign trail: ""It’s kind of reasonable to think that if (Johnson) had a chance to vote for drilling the Great Lakes, he’d be first in line",True,"September 3, 2010"
"""Since being elected, (Tom Barrett) has dumped 8.2 billion gallons of raw sewage into Lake Michigan.""","
Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker is raising a stink over sewage. It’s a tempting target, especially when torrential rains July 22 and July 23 forced the dumping of untreated sewage into Lake Michigan and thousands of homes were hit with flooded basements.

Walker, a Republican candidate for governor, is blaming his opponent, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, a Democrat, for dumping the sewage -- not only for the July overflows, but for releases going back to 2004, when Barrett was first elected.

On at least two occasions, Walker campaign manager Keith Gilkes blamed Barrett for the recent mess and previous overflows. On Aug. 5, Gilkes made the charge during a visit to the city by Lisa Jackson, head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. On Aug. 11, he made the same charge after local communities complained about a large water rate increase being proposed by Barrett’s Milwaukee Water Works.

With summer winding down, it’s a topic fresh in many people’s minds: torrents of water running through streets, the giant sinkhole on E. North Ave. that swallowed a Cadillac Escalade and the mounds of water-soaked junk carted from homes in the aftermath.  Five to eight inches of rain fell July 22 and July 23, according to the National Weather Service. Officially, 5.61 inches fell at Mitchell International Airport, the second highest daily rainfall on record for Milwaukee.

With so much rain, Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District reported it couldn’t treat 2.1 billion gallons of sewage and storm water, which ended up going in  the lake.

MMSD has done that every year, to varying degrees depending on the weather: When the deep tunnels run out of room and the sewage treatment plants on Jones Island and South Shore can’t keep up, the district shuts off access to the tunnels and sends untreated sewage into the lake. The overflows present environmental problems for the lake, but without them, sewage is more apt to back up into people’s basements. By law, the district is required to report the releases to the state Department of Natural Resources.

Going back to when Barrett was first elected mayor, and highlighting a campaign promise made in 2004, the Walker campaign said the sewage dumps are Barrett’s fault. ""Since being elected, he has dumped 8.2 billion gallons of raw sewage into Lake Michigan,"" Gilkes said.

That’s a lot of flushing, so we decided to look into the claims.  

First the number. The Walker organization used media reports from the overflows going back to 2004 and tallied up what went untreated.

We found Walker low-balled it. Had his campaign staff checked with MMSD - the totals are on the district’s website -- his people would have found that overflows actually totaled 10.4 billion gallons since 2004. Walker undershot the mark by 21percent.

Walker spokeswoman Jill Bader said her staff assumed news reports, including figures from Milwaukee Journal Sentinel stories, were comprehensive. But by using different news accounts from different sources to tally up the figures, their number was off. For instance, in 2007, the Walker campaign didn’t use news reports from the Journal Sentinel at all, and in so doing missed nearly 400 million gallons of overflows. After being contacted by PolitiFact Wisconsin, she said the campaign staff had recently come across the district’s higher figures.

Now, the discharges themselves.

Is it raw sewage? That term sounds like it’s all coming from toilets.  Actually, an estimated 95 percent is rainwater and runoff. Still, it’s untreated and therefore can be considered ""raw.""

Finally, what about Barrett’s role in all of this?

In a literal sense, he doesn’t have a hand in it. The city doesn’t operate Jones Island or the South Shore plant. The July decision to shut the gates to the deep tunnel system and start overflows was made by Kevin Shafer, MMSD’s executive director, in concert with his staff and Veolia Water North America, which operates the district’s waste water treatment system.

Shafer said he made his first decision at about 6 p.m. on July 22 for the combined sewer system covering portions of Milwaukee and Shorewood and again at 1 a.m. the next day for the separated sewer system. It’s the same procedure for all overflows.

""There is no contact with elected officials,"" Shafer said. ""It’s purely an operational/technical decision that I make.""

But Barrett bears some responsibility.

During his first campaign for mayor in 2004, Barrett was highly critical of MMSD and he vowed to fix the problem by demanding that the agency stop dumping raw sewage. ""The Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District must clean up its act,"" Barrett said during the campaign. A Barrett radio ad lamented that MMSD the previous summer had ""dumped 90,000 gallons of raw sewage into Lincoln Creek,"" which ultimately flows into the lake, and cited this as an example of the ""outrageous failures of the district.""

As mayor, Barrett controls seven out of the 11 members of the MMSD board. He has the ability through his appointments to influence policy and procedures.

The district plans to spend $1 billion by the end of the year to create new capacity and make other improvements to reduce overflows under a 2002 court-approved agreement between the DNR and MMSD. The new 27th Street tunnel project added 27 million gallons of capacity. A 7.1 mile long tunnel on the northwest side added 89 millions gallons of capacity.

The entire storage system can store 521 million gallons until MMSD can process it.

That means to handle the 2.1 billion gallons of overflow from the July storm, MMSD would need a system that is about four times larger. On the 27th Street tunnel project, the district said it spent $3 for every gallon of capacity. So if that cost held true, the price tag for an expansion able to handle 2.1 billion gallons would be about $6 billion.

James Fratrick, a watershed specialist for the  DNR, said that MMSD will never completely stop untreated waste from being released into Lake Michigan, and its state permit allows some emergency dumping to occur because zero discharge is not practical or required under federal law.

""With rainfall events like this, it’s not economically feasible,"" Fratrick said.

So there is some truth to Walker’s statement in that Barrett pledged he would stop the flows during the campaign and can influence the policies and procedures through his appointments to the board. But it’s an exaggeration to say that Barrett himself dumped the raw sewage into the lake after the extraordinary rainfall",True,"September 3, 2010"
"Kathryn Starkey ""only attended half of those meetings.""","
A new political mailer from the Committee to Protect Florida attacks State House District 45 candidate Kathryn Starkey of New Port Richey for her record on taxes, citing her role on a water district board and her support of the Penny for Pasco, a 2004 increase in the county sales tax.

The committee is headed up by Rockie Pennington, a political consultant for Richard Corcoran, one of Starkey’s two opponents in the Aug. 24 Republican primary. (Fabian Calvo is also on the ballot.)

""Taxin’ Kathryn,"" says the mailer sent in early August 2010. ""With Kathryn Starkey’s record on taxes here at home, how can we trust her -- or afford her -- in Tallahassee?""

We wondered, can you trust the mailer’s claims? We looked at three claims, and this Truth-O-Meter item tackles her attendance at meetings. Other items are here on her voting record for river board tax rates, and here on her actions involving the Pasco sales tax.

We looked at the claim that ""As a member of the Pinellas-Anclote River Basin Board, Kathryn Starkey had the opportunity to fight for lower taxes in 14 separate budget meetings between 2002 and 2008. But ... She only attended half of those meetings!""

Pennington said he based that claim on minutes from the basin board’s meetings. We took a look, too.

We looked at two budget meetings each year: June, when the basin board typically sets its preliminary tax rate, and August, when it takes a final vote. (In 2007, the final vote was taken in July.)

Starkey served on the board from June 2002 through April 2008, so we looked only at the 12 budget-related meetings that fell within that period. (Pennington, who put together his mailer a month ago, said he wasn’t sure why we came up with different counts for the meetings.)

Of 12 budget meetings she could have attended, Starkey attended seven (five of those seven were the final votes). That attendance record is more than half — by a hair",Mostly True,"August 13, 2010"
"Kathryn Starkey ""aided and abetted the continued taxation on residents’ properties over 70 percent of the time by seconding motions and voting to keep the millage rate the same.""","
A new political mailer from the Committee to Protect Florida attacks House District 45 candidate Kathryn Starkey of New Port Richey for her record on taxes, citing her role on a water district board and her support of the Penny for Pasco, a 2004 increase in the county sales tax.

The committee is headed up by Rockie Pennington, a political consultant for Richard Corcoran, one of Starkey’s two opponents in the Aug. 24 Republican primary. (Fabian Calvo is also on the ballot.)

""Taxin’ Kathryn,"" says the mailer sent in early August 2010 . ""With Kathryn Starkey’s record on taxes here at home, how can we trust her -- or afford her -- in Tallahassee?""

We wondered, can you trust the mailer’s claims? We looked at three claims, and this Truth-O-Meter item examines her voting record on setting tax rates. Other items are here on her attendance at river board meetings and here on her actions involving the sales tax.

After questioning Starkey’s attendance record as a member of the Pinellas-Anclote River Basin Board, the mailer says that when she did attend, ""Starkey aided and abetted the continued taxation on residents’ properties over 70 percent of the time by seconding motions and voting to keep the millage rate the same DESPITE skyrocketing property values that allowed local governments to pad their budgets.""

Here is what the minutes show.

Of the seven budget meetings she attended, the board voted six times to keep the tax rate the same. Starkey voted with her colleagues five out of those six times (She cast a dissenting vote in 2006). So overall, she voted over 70 percent of the time to keep the same tax rate.

All this came as taxable values were soaring in Pinellas and Pasco counties.

Between fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2007, when the rate stayed at 40 cents per $1,000 of assessed value, the total taxable values for the basin board went from roughly $48 billion to $81 billion in Pasco and Pinellas counties, according to Southwest Florida Water Management District.

By the time the board lowered the rate to 37 cents for fiscal year 2008, the total values were roughly $86.6 billion.

Simply counting votes misses an important fact, though. Starkey did make efforts to lower the tax rate.

In 2004, for instance, she made a motion to lower the rate to 39 cents. The motion died for lack of a second, and Starkey went along with the rest of the board to keep the tax rate the same.

And it was Starkey who took the lead role in 2006 when she again argued for lowering the rate, this time making a motion to set it at 37 1/2 cents.

The motion failed. She tried again, arguing for 38 cents. Her motion failed again. The board voted 3 to 2 to keep it at 40 cents, and Starkey dissented for the first time.

At the preliminary budget meeting in June 2007, Starkey made the motion to set the rate for the 2008 budget at 37 cents, which finally passed.

""Every year I tried to roll it back,"" she said, but didn’t have the votes.

Pennington’s mailer is technically correct: Starkey did go along with votes most of the time to keep the tax rate for the basin board the same, even as taxable values soared.

But it leaves out the important context that Starkey tried over three years to lower the tax rate",Half True,"August 13, 2010"
"Kathryn Starkey ""joined forces with liberal Democrats on a historic sales tax hike.""","
A new political mailer from the Committee to Protect Florida attacks State House District 45 candidate Kathryn Starkey of New Port Richey for her record on taxes, citing her role on a water district board and her support of the Penny for Pasco, a 2004 increase in the county sales tax.

The committee is headed up by Rockie Pennington, a political consultant for Richard Corcoran, one of Starkey’s two opponents in the Aug. 24 Republican primary. (Fabian Calvo is also on the ballot.)

""Taxin’ Kathryn,"" says the mailer sent in early August 2010. ""With Kathryn Starkey’s record on taxes here at home, how can we trust her -- or afford her -- in Tallahassee?""

We wondered, can you trust the mailer’s claims? We looked at three claims, and this Truth-O-Meter item examines her actions and stance on the Penny for Pasco sales tax. Other items are here on her attendance at river board meetings and here on her actions involving votes on river board tax rates.

The tax hike in question is the Penny for Pasco sales tax, a one-cent-on-the-dollar county sales tax increase to build new schools and roads, preserve land and buy public safety equipment. About 52 percent of voters approved the tax in March 2004. By the end of 2009, the extra penny had pulled in about $205 million.

The claim that Starkey ""joined forces with liberal Democrats"" to pass the tax has problems.

First, Starkey played no strong public role in selling the tax to voters. She publicly endorsed the Penny for Pasco during her successful 2004 campaign for School Board, but she never actively campaigned for it or joined the committee promoting it.

Second, where were the liberal Democrats? Pasco’s Citizen Committee, the political action committee that formed to promote the tax, had 14 key volunteers: 10 of them were registered Republicans, the Pasco Times reported then.

They included well-known Republicans Allen Altman, Joanne Hurley, Thad Lowery and Bill Phillips.

True, the tax got the endorsement of Pasco’s Democratic Executive Committee and not that of the county’s Republican Executive Committee.

But consider, too, the prominent Republican politicians who publicly supported the tax: Commissioners Ted Schrader, Ann Hildebrand and Pat Mulieri and then-commissioner Steve Simon, along with then-state representatives Ken Littlefield and Heather Fiorentino.

And don’t forget Pasco Sheriff Bob White, another Republican, who was quoted in the Pasco Times calling support of the tax a ""no-brainer.""

White said then that his remarks were aimed primarily at how the tax would help the school district, but his endorsement — however nuanced — was political gold for the tax’s backers.

One big selling point for Republicans: The sales tax would result in a property tax reduction on the school district side. (Incidentally, that is not unlike Corcoran’s platform in the House 45 campaign to eliminate property taxes and increase the sales tax.)

To be sure, there were Democrats who were very involved in the effort. They included Land O’Lakes lawyer Tim Hayes and, most visibly, Ray Gadd, who led the school system’s effort as a Pasco school district administrator at the time. Then-commissioner Peter Altman, a Democrat, was also a vocal supporter.

""I can’t think of a liberal Democrat who was involved,"" said Gadd, who, incidentally, has changed his affiliation to independent.

The strongest opponents of the tax included Republicans Bill and Ann Bunting, leaders in the local party. But even they acknowledge that they were more often fighting people with Rs, not Ds, after their names.

""I can’t for the life of me understand how those Republicans supported it,"" said Ann Bunting.
Pennington, Corcoran’s consultant, said he linked Starkey with the Penny leaders because her endorsement as a School Board candidate carried weight. He said he also thought Allen Altman, who helped spearhead the campaign, was a Democrat. (Wrong.)

Corcoran was equally mistaken that the tax was a strongly Democratic initiative. ""It was overwhelmingly pushed by Democratic leaders,"" he said. (He was also unaware that White — whom he now works for as a contract attorney — endorsed the Penny.)

A new tax may be often associated with ""liberal Democrats,"" but that wasn’t the case with Penny for Pasco, particularly when it came to those who were publicly pushing for it. In addition, Starkey was not a key promoter of the tax",False,"August 13, 2010"
"""In renewable and advanced energy manufacturing projects, Ohio now ranks first among the 50 states.""","
Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland is on a mission to prove that a traditionally blue-collar, manufacturing state can make the transition to become a leader in the futuristic green energy industry. And he is touting his leadership for bringing the state recognition.

""In renewable and advanced energy manufacturing projects, Ohio now ranks first among the 50 states,"" Strickland said during a July 6 speech at the Ohio Democratic Party headquarters in Columbus.

The governor said he was convinced when he took office more than three years ago that the right energy policies, coupled with Ohio’s manufacturing history and infrastructure, could be the foundation to build the state into an energy leader. And he rattled off a list of green energy accolades for the state, including this No. 1 ranking in renewable and advanced energy manufacturing projects.

But is it true?

Ohio got the ranking in July 2008 for bringing in more new facility projects than any other state between 2005 and 2007. Strickland took office in January 2007.

The ranking was contained in The Conway New Plant Report and reported in the July 2008 issue of SITE Selection magazine, an economic development trade publication. The Ohio Business Development Coalition touted the ranking in a news release in August 2008.

But the report and rankings have not been updated since 2008 and there are no plans to do so, said Adam Bruns, SITE Selection’s managing editor.  The magazine has moved on to analyzing, reviewing and ranking cities and states on other advanced energy-related projects, he says.

In some respects, that means Ohio could argue that it’s still No. 1 and Strickland would be correct.

But we think it’s a significant omission by the governor to not mention that the ranking is two years old, particularly when he is touting it as an example of successful policy. In fact, some of the accomplishments for which the state was recognized by SITE’s report actually occurred before Strickland took office",Half True,"July 30, 2010"
"""We caught (the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality) lying to us about the results of air quality studies in the Barnett Shale.""","
Speaking at the Texas Democratic convention last month, Sen. Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth, lambasted the state agency responsible for approving permits to pollute the air. 
""The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality — what a joke,"" she said during a speech to delegates June 26. ""In my district, we caught them lying to us about the results of air quality studies in the Barnett Shale. They are playing with the health and safety of our communities, and we are going to tell them that is not acceptable."" 
First, the basics: When we contacted Davis to elaborate on her statement, Davis said that ""we"" meant the public. 
But was TCEQ lying? The answer to that question is more complicated. 
From Dec. 15-17, TCEQ tested air samples collected at 126 natural gas production sites in Fort Worth for toxic pollutants. Natural gas drilling creates pollution from a couple sources, according to the Star-Telegram: the tank batteries that store wastewater and condensate — a light form of crude oil that often vents into the atmosphere — and the motors that drive pipeline compressors. Plus, drillers vent natural gas into the atmosphere when they complete a well. Fort Worth covers about 6 percent of the Barnett Shale, a natural gas field that covers more than 20 counties, according to the Star-Telegram. 
On Jan. 12, John Sadlier, deputy director of the office of compliance and enforcement at TCEQ, presented the results to the Fort Worth City Council. ""Based on this study, the air is safe,"" he said, reporting that the agency didn't find pollutants at levels that could cause health problems. 
Eight slides accompanying the presentation had a red disclaimer noting that the samples had not been collected, analyzed or reviewed following specific protocol for quality control. TCEQ spokesman Terry Clawson told us that the city had asked TCEQ to perform tests ""as quickly as possible"" using the agency's mobile laboratory. (The request came on the heels of testing in DISH, a nearby town, that revealed high levels of benzene and other compounds.) While the mobile lab enables results to be produced within hours after samples are taken, Clawson said, the testing didn't meet national standards. 
Davis pointed out that the slides shown to the city council clearly said that benzene didn't exceed the levels considered safe for both short-term and long-term health, instead of noting that the data to prove that wasn't available. 
On Feb. 3, someone filed a fraud complaint with the TCEQ chief auditor's office, alleging the agency's monitoring operation had knowingly reported ""inaccurate and misleading"" information based on inadequate testing methods for butadiene, isoprene and benzene. The office initiated an audit, reporting the results on March 25. 
According to the audit memo, shortly after the council presentation, Sadlier questioned the validity of the data and ordered further tests. TCEQ sent the air samples to its lab using a more sensitive analysis. On Jan. 22, those tests showed that several samples measured benzene, a byproduct of gas drilling known to cause cancer in humans, at levels that exceeded those considered safe for people's long-term health. TCEQ did not report the new results to council members. 
The memo said Sadlier ordered more tests in February. Once more, TCEQ detected benzene, but not at levels that exceeded state standards. Clawson told us those results were published in a report dated April 26. The report was shared with the city of Fort Worth and posted on the agency's website on May 21. Davis said that it was ""buried,"" so that someone visiting the site wouldn't know it was there unless they were looking for it. 
Still with us? On June 1, TCEQ released results from samples taken at two sites in late April — that would be the fourth round of tests — that again showed levels of benzene exceeding the state's long-term health standard. ""State officials have said the level is not enough to cause immediate health problems, but it could make people sick if they were exposed continually for several years. It also serves as an indication that more testing in the area is needed,"" according to a June 2 Star-Telegram article. 
Clawson told us that TCEQ later collected more samples at the two facilities and did not find benzene that exceeded short-term or long-term exposure levels. That report was published and distributed to the City of Fort Worth on July 7, he said. 
Clawson told us that the agency regrets ""the failure to communicate the results to the city in a more timely fashion."" However, he also said that during presentation to the Fort Worth City Council, ""we stated that tests found 'no cause for concern.' This statement was true then, and it is true today."" 
As for the fraud complaint against the agency, the March 25 auditor's report concluded that the information provided to Sadlier from the first round of tests ""while technically correct, could be considered to be misleading."" It did not find evidence that Monitoring Operation's management knew the information was misleading. Sadlier said he didn't know the equipment couldn't detect lower levels of benzene when he talked to city officials, according to a May 28 Dallas Morning News article. 
Just a few days after TCEQ posted the toxicology report online May 21, the Texas Observer broke the story about the fraud complaint and audit, prompting Davis to issue a press release blasting the agency for waiting ""four months to reveal these disturbing test results. The agency had determined the public had been exposed to elevated levels of benzene, and yet the public and their elected officials were not made aware of these exposures."" 
On May 28 Davis filed a 30-point open-records request, asking for all TCEQ documents and communications related to benzene and other potentially harmful chemicals that may, could be, or are found in the air above the Barnett Shale. 
In our conversation with Davis last week, she said that Mark Vickery, executive director of the TCEQ, had called her to apologize. ""He was very contrite, expressed great apology for not having revealed to me the information before,"" she said, adding that Vickery told her TCEQ didn't think the January test results posed ""a serious health risk and therefore did not disclose it."" 
Where does that leave us? 
First, TCEQ reported data that backed up the agency's claim that emissions from the Barnett Shale sites in Fort Worth were safe, but those tests could not measure lower levels of toxic chemicals. Subsequently, more sensitive tests have gone back and forth: some showed benzene levels exceeding the standard for long-term health effects and some did not. Until recently, the agency has not reported the results promptly. To Davis' point: TCEQ waited four months to alert officials of the January tests that detected elevated levels of benzene. 
Did the agency lie, as Davis claimed? Or simply fail to disclose — by TCEQ's own admission — in a timely fashion? 
""Hiding the truth is lying,"" Davis said",Half True,"July 25, 2010"
"House Republicans who complained they didn't have enough time to consider a constitutional ban against oil drilling ""shoved through a proposal in just a few days to open state waters to oil drilling.""","
The July 20, 2010, special session to consider a constitutional amendment banning oil drilling in state-controlled waters was full of drama and political theatrics, but ultimately little action. 
The session came and went in about two hours with the Republican-controlled House and Senate failing to even consider adding anti-drilling language to the November ballot. The House voted along party lines 67-44 to adjourn the session without action. The Senate voted 18-16 to adjourn.

None of it, however, stopped political leaders from both major parties, and independent Gov. Charlie Crist, from trying to score political points.

Among the near-constant volleys of accusations, name-calling and bickering, we found a statement from Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink particularly interesting.

Speaking to reporters before the Legislature convened the noon session, Sink launched a pre-emptive attack against GOP legislators.

""Today at noon, I expect to see the culmination of the complete failure of the Florida Legislature to be in tune with what's going on the real world of Florida,"" said Sink, a Democrat who is running for governor. ""In the same chamber, where House Republicans shoved through a proposal in just a few days to open state waters to oil drilling, those same Republicans will stand at their desks to claim they don't have enough time.""

During the 51 minutes of House debate before legislators adjourned, we heard from several Republicans about the need to deliberately and methodically consider the impacts of an oil drilling ban. House Speaker Larry Cretul, for instance, suggested the Legislature should consider whether to put a constitutional amendment on the ballot in 2012 -- in the calm after the crisis. 
""The fact remains that (Crist) has called us here at the last possible moment to consider a constitutional amendment for which he never proposed any language, and permitted far too little time for reflection and review,"" Cretul said. ""This is a terrible way to propose constitutional changes."" 
Was, as Sink suggested, that same line-of-thinking absent when legislators considered a proposal to allow drilling in state waters?

Sink spokeswoman Kyra Jennings pointed us to the House's oil drilling legislation in 2009 as proof.

That year, state Rep. Dean Cannon -- who is set to become Speaker -- filed a bill that would allow the governor and cabinet to award oil and natural gas leases in state waters between three and 10 miles offshore.

The bill passed the House 70-43 but stalled in the Senate.

From soup to nuts, how long did it take House legislators to consider and approve the measure?

The state keeps a thorough log that follows the progress of legislation. PolitiFact Florida went back to track HB 1219, the Cannon oil drilling bill.

The bill originally was filed on Feb. 26, 2009, but that's misleading. The original bill only asked the Department of Environmental Protection to develop a plan for the implementation of an oil and natural gas drilling program.

Cannon, of Winter Park, didn't unveil the final oil drilling language until April 20 (a Monday night), hours before it was scheduled to be considered by a House Policy Council. The Orlando Sentinel called Cannon's language a ""surprise,"" when it was introduced. The Pensacola News-Journal reported that it ""caught opponents off guard."" In an editorial, the St. Petersburg Times called the act a ""shameful"" oil drilling ploy.

The language, which was supported by oil drilling proponents such as the Associated Industries of Florida, passed out of the Policy Council 17-7. It was sent to the House floor the next day, a Wednesday.

From the Times editorial:

""Cannon sprang the radical idea to allow oil rigs within 3 miles of the coast in the eighth week of a nine-week legislative session. And he did it even as the House has failed to consider the governor's plan to foster renewable energy. Florida needs more than 10 days to consider changing a law that has protected its shores for decades, and the Senate and governor should reject it.

""Clearly, Associated Industries of Florida has been working with Cannon for weeks to try to reverse a 20-year drilling ban -- though Cannon unveiled it just 12 hours before it passed a House council Tuesday. A pollster hired to do a survey, an industry expert from Texas and an Orlando economist touting potential revenue all testified. Cannon contended HB 1219 is merely an attempt 'to have a mature, thoughtful conversation about what we want to do about this.' So why is the public just now hearing about it?""

Once on the House floor, HB 1219 was read three times as required. The first reading came on April 22 (a Wednesday), the second on April 24 (a Friday).

The bill was read a third time, and amendments were considered on April 27 (the following Monday). The bill passed at 4:40 p.m.

We should make clear that the Cannon legislation didn't directly allow oil and natural gas exploration in Florida waters; rather, it permitted the governor and cabinet to allow drilling. Another step would have been required.

Regardless, the bill language was first made public on a Monday night and initially looked at by legislators the next morning. It passed the the following Monday. Total time in the hopper: Five working days.

The special session to consider the oil drilling constitutional amendment was scheduled to last four days. Of course, it lasted just a few hours.

In chastising Republican lawmakers, state CFO Alex Sink said the House ""shoved through a proposal in just a few days to open state waters to oil drilling."" It took House lawmakers just five working days from first seeing the bill to passing it",True,"July 21, 2010"
"Russ Feingold ""voted against the law that protected our lakes"" and ""was the only Great Lakes senator to vote no.""","
The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is at the top of the news, but the political ripples are being felt far and wide. In Wisconsin, Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold and Republican challenger Ron Johnson have gotten into a bit of mudslinging over who would be better at protecting the Great Lakes from drilling.

Feingold started the war of words by charging in a 30-second ad that Johnson ""is willing to hand over the Great Lakes to the oil companies, threatening Wisconsin’s economy, and a way of life for generations of Wisconsin families.""

Johnson quickly shot back with a statement saying in part, ""I would not support any efforts to overturn the provision which outlaws drilling in the Great Lakes as Wisconsin’s next U.S. Senator. Let me repeat: I would reject any and all efforts to drill in the Great Lakes.""

Johnson drove home that theme in a 30-second television ad. In the ad, viewers see a car spinning its wheels in the mud.

""Twenty-eight years in politics and Russ Feingold’s stuck in the mud,"" the narrator says. ""Feingold started his campaign slinging mud at Ron Johnson. Ron Johnson opposes drilling in the Great Lakes, and Russ Feingold knows it. Drilling is already illegal in the Great Lakes, and Feingold knows that too. Because he voted against the law that protected our lakes. That’s right. Feingold was the only Great Lakes senator to vote no. Feingold played politics. Partisan politician Russ Feingold. Stuck in the mud.""

In this item, we won't get into the question of whether Johnson opposes drilling in the Great Lakes. But we thought we'd sort out whether Feingold had indeed voted against a bill to ban Great Lakes drilling.

The bill that Johnson's ad refers to is the Energy Policy Act of 2005. A provision of that law -- Section 386 -- reads, ""No Federal or State permit or lease shall be issued for new oil and gas slant, directional, or offshore drilling in or under one or more of the Great Lakes."" A check of the Senate roll call vote on the final version of that bill confirms that Feingold voted ""nay.""

Case closed? Not quite. The claim requires several caveats.

• Feingold wasn't voting against the bill because of the drilling ban. The bill in question was championed by President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, most congressional Republicans and some Democrats. Nineteen Democrats, six Republicans and one independent voted against the bill, which passed, 74-26.

At the time, Feingold cited several reasons for voting against the bill.

""This bill digs us deeper into a budget black hole,"" Feingold said, according to his home state newspaper, the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. ""It fails to decrease our dependence on foreign oil. It rolls back important consumer protections. And finally, it undermines some of the fundamental environmental laws that our citizens rely upon."" He also cited the bill's repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act, its changes to the Clean Water Act and its exemption of hydraulic fracking -- a controversial technique for retrieving underground natural gas -- from the Safe Drinking Water Act.

He most certainly didn't vote against it because it included a Great Lakes drilling ban. Quite the contrary: Feingold's camp points out that in 2001, the senator was an original co-sponsor of the Great Lakes Water Protection Act, which directed the Environmental Protection Agency Administrator to conduct a study on known and potential environmental effects of oil and gas drilling on land beneath the water in the Great Lakes. (The bill did not advance.) Feingold also sponsored or supported numerous other bills to protect the Great Lakes specifically and clean water generally.

The Johnson camp told PolitiFact that ""our ad never insinuates Sen. Feingold did not support a 2001 bill regarding Great Lakes or make any other statement about whether or not he supports drilling in the Great Lakes."" But we think a reasonable person could come away with the ad wondering whether Feingold is somehow opposed to a ban on Great Lakes drilling. And that would be incorrect.

That said, congressional bills often have hundreds or thousands of provisions. Most of the time, lawmakers who vote yes on a bill don't agree with everything in it, and when they vote for it because of the many things they do agree with, they must be prepared for critics to point out the discrepancies. So we think Johnson deserves some leeway for legitimately catching Feingold voting against something he says he supports.

• There wasn't just one law that curbed drilling in the Great Lakes. The ad says that Russ Feingold ""voted against the law that protected our lakes."" That makes it sound like there was one law that accomplished that purpose, and that Feingold missed his chance to support it. That's incorrect. There were actually four, one of which was permanent -- the one cited in the ad -- and three of which were temporary. All did essentially the same thing.

According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, ""Congress had enacted a temporary ban on any new federal and state permits for drilling under the Great Lakes in 2001 (P.L. 107-66; Title V, §503) and extended it to 2007. This temporary ban was in addition to several state bans on drilling in or under the Great Lakes.""

So we looked up the 2001 law to see whether Feingold voted for it. He did. (The bill passed overwhelmingly, 96-2.) Specifically, it was the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act of 2002, which included a provision that said that ""during the fiscal years 2002 and 2003, no federal or state permit or lease shall be issued for new oil and gas slant, directional, or offshore drilling in or under one or more of the Great Lakes.""

We also looked up the extension for 2004 and 2005, which passed as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution of 2003 -- a massive federal spending bill. In this case, Feingold voted no.

Finally, we looked up the law that extended the ban through 2006 and 2007. It was the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005. Feingold voted no on that one too.

So Feingold actually voted for one temporary ban and voted against three (two of them temporary, one permanent). All were buried in much broader bills, and his camp says he opposed those bills despite the drilling ban provision, not because of it. At the same time, even though he only batted one for four, Feingold has a right to say that in one case, he voted for a ""law that protected our lakes.""

• Feingold was not the only Great Lakes senator to vote no on the 2005 bill. Johnson cited yes votes by senators from Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But he excluded New York state, which borders Lake Ontario and Lake Erie. Both New York senators at the time -- Democrats Hillary Clinton and Charles Schumer -- joined Feingold in voting no. 
The Johnson campaign told PolitiFact that ""including or excluding two New York City senators as Great Lakes senators is subjective, and many government and academic sources do not group New York in the Great Lakes region."" They cited the Great Lakes Regional Water Program University of Wisconsin Extension (which defines the Great Lakes Region as ""Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin""), the Bureau of Economic Analysis (which defines the Great Lakes Region as ""Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin""), and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (which defines the Great Lakes Region as ""Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin""). 
But we think the implication that Clinton and Schumer somehow forfeit their right to represent residents on Lake Ontario and Lake Erie is ridiculous. In addition, if the campaign was going to use these three alternate groupings as gospel, they should have also eliminated Pennsylvania, which does not appear in any of the three they cite. But they didn't: The Johnson campaign's backup sheet for the ad cites Pennsylvania, but not New York.

This strikes us as cherry picking. We find no good rationale for excluding New York, so on this count, we find Johnson's ad clearly inaccurate.

So let's sum up. Feingold did vote against a bill that included the permanent ban on Great Lakes drilling, and also voted against two of the bills with temporary bans, though for reasons unrelated to the drilling ban provision. As a result, Johnson has some justification for saying that Feingold ""voted against the law that protected our lakes."" But the ad ignores that Feingold supported one of the temporary bans, and that he has a long record of protecting the environmental quality of the Great Lakes, including championing at least one bill that dealt directly with drilling. Meanwhile, we don't buy the campaign's rationale for excluding New York from the list of Great Lakes states. That fundamentally undercuts the ad's claim that Feingold was the only Great Lakes senator to vote against the 2005 bill",True,"July 19, 2010"
"""We had 2 percent of the global market (for advanced batteries) when he (Obama) started. We now have 16 percent, headed to 40 percent by 2015.""","
President Barack Obama has repeatedly stressed the need for the U.S. to get out front in the production of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. One of the main obstacles has been that few American manufacturers were producing advanced batteries to power those vehicles. 
The economic stimulus championed by Obama included $2.4 billion to spur the creation of electric vehicle battery and component manufacturing plants. And this week, the White House repeatedly boasted that those investments are starting to pay off.

Nine new battery plants have opened with the help of stimulus money, and the White House says four will be operational by the end of the year. The White House says higher-volume domestic manufacturing of advanced batteries will greatly reduce the cost of batteries -- which is crucial if electric vehicles are to become a viable option for car-buyers.

On ABC's This Week on July 11, 2010, White House adviser David Axelrod said the stimulus has made the U.S. a global player in the advanced battery market.

""He (Obama) is going on Thursday to Michigan to a plant that produces advanced batteries for electric cars,"" Axelrod said. ""We had 2 percent of the global market when he started. We now have 16 percent, headed to 40 percent by 2015, because we helped spur and leverage private investment, and that's what we want to do.""

That's quite a leap, and so we decided to check it out.

The first part of Axelrod's equation -- that the U.S. had 2 percent of the global market at the start of the Obama presidency -- is defensible. There wasn't much advanced battery production being done then, except for hybrid electric vehicles. And, at that time, according to a 2008 report from the Department of Energy, only one company was assembling batteries in the U.S. for mass-produced vehicles. They were making batteries for the Saturn Vue. The Ford Escape Hybrid was being assembled in the U.S., but the batteries came from Asia. In any case, that one company, Cobasys, commanded a 2 percent share of the batteries supplied in 2008, according to the report.

As for where Axelrod got the other figures -- that ""we now have 16 percent, headed to 40 percent by 2015"" -- the White House press office pointed us toward a Deutsche Bank study of announced capacity to produce lithium ion batteries. The study projected the U.S. would have 20 percent by 2012 and up to 40 percent by 2015.

Unlike Axelrod, the White House press office noted that these estimates are about capacity, not actual production.

The projection of capacity by Deutsche Bank ""pretty well matches with the other projections of announced capacity,"" said Mike Millikin, editor of the Green Car Congress.

""The Administration has certainly put its money toward boosting U.S. capacity,"" Millikin said. ""However, what ultimately matters is production and purchases.""

In fact, many industry experts say capacity will far exceed demand for, and production of, advanced batteries.

In April, 2010, Menahem Anderman, founder and chief executive of Total Battery Consulting, issued a report on plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) and electric vehicles (EVs) based on-site interviews with top technologists and executives at 20 major automakers and 15 current and prospective battery suppliers on three continents.

""The government’s stimulus money will create severe overcapacity from 2013 on,"" Anderman told PolitiFact. ""There is no market for the capacity planned.""

That's because demand for the cars is limited by high up-front cost and still-evolving battery technology.

""Unfortunately the mass EV and PHEV market at current gasoline pricing and battery technology status (cost, performance and life) will require unaffordable heavy subsidies to carmakers, battery makers and the consumer,"" Anderman said.

And because the market is so dependent on government subsidies, he said, it is risky.

""Our projections are that the combined EV/PHEV world new vehicle market will be on the order of 200,000 vehicles in 2015 and 1 million in 2020,"" Anderman said. ""The government-paid battery plants that are supposed to be operational by 2013 will be heavily underutilized for years; they will have enough capacity to support the 2020 U.S. market.""

""Indeed the U.S. will have many unutilized plants,"" Anderman predicted. ""The major Japanese players (Sanyo, Panasonic, Hitachi) hesitate to invest in EV batteries since they are skeptical about the EV market.""

Any suggestion that sales of actual batteries will follow announced planned capacity is naive, he said. Many companies that received stimulus money don't have a proven battery ready for mass production and are at least several years away from being qualified by major car companies. And with no experience running a high-volume automated Lithium Ion battery plant, Anderman said, most of the companies will face a slow and costly learning curve.

""Nobody can predict market share for 2015, but I will be surprised if U.S. will get much more than 10 percent,"" Anderman said. ""There are 5 major Japanese suppliers and two Korean that are 10 years ahead in manufacturing experience.""

The Freedonia Group, a Cleveland-based industry market research firm, estimated that in 2017, the U.S. will command 9 percent of the world market (dollar-wise) for lithium-based rechargeable batteries, including those for electric vehicles.

Our biggest issue with Axelrod's claim is that he mixes two different statistics. The 2 percent figure represents actual production; the 16 percent, going to 40 percent by 2015, figures are for capacity. Those are two different things.

In a July 15, 2010, speech at a new advanced battery factory in Holland, Mich., which was seeded with stimulus cash, Obama worded the statistic more carefully.

""Just a few years ago, American businesses manufactured only 2 percent of the world’s advanced batteries for electric and hybrid vehicles -- 2 percent,"" Obama said. ""But because of what’s happening in places like this, in just five years we’ll have up to 40 percent of the world’s capacity -- 40 percent.""

It takes a careful ear to discern that he's talking about two different statistics. And presented back-to-back, as they were, we think it's misleading.

In fact, here's how a White House press release about advanced battery investments in the stimulus stated the statistic this week:

""Pre-Recovery Act, the U.S. produced just 2 percent of the world’s batteries for advanced vehicles, but due to Recovery Act investments, the U.S. will have the capacity to produce 20 percent of these batteries by 2012 and up to 40 percent by 2015 - that’s a jump from 2 percent to 40 percent in a span of just five years.""

No, it's not a jump from 2 to 40. The 2 percent was a production number. The 40 percent is a capacity number. It remains to be seen how much of that capacity will be utilized. But most market analysts predict that the U.S. share of the advanced battery market -- actual sales of advanced batteries -- will be much lower than 40 percent",Half True,"July 15, 2010"
"Says Texas has one state inspector for every 4,500 oil and gas wells.","
Seeking a seat on the Texas Railroad Commission, Houston lawyer Jeff Weems said the commission’s in charge of making sure a disaster like the BP oil spill doesn’t happen in Texas. The Democratic nominee went on to tell the United Auto Workers caucus at the party’s state convention June 25: ""Right now, there is one inspector for every 4,500 wells. You can’t do that job."" 
Understaffing in the extreme? We wondered if Weems got that right. 
In e-mails, Weems told us he heard there’s one field inspector for every 4,500 wells from Paul Whitehead, who works in a commission office in Midland. Weems said that's higher than the 1-for-3,300 ratio he got earlier from ProPublica, which describes itself as ""an independent, non-profit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest."" ProPublica published an article in December 2009 saying the Texas commission had 83 field inspectors, ""meaning each person is responsible for almost 3,300 wells, many of them requiring several visits in a year."" 
It quotes Weems saying: ""It's one of the worst-kept secrets around the state that the wells that are ostensibly checked once a year aren't. They could double the number of inspectors and still be straining their staff to do their job."" 
Whitehead referred us to the commission’s Austin headquarters where spokeswoman Ramona Nye confirmed that of late, there are 86 inspectors for 394,365 oil and gas wells, including 282,150 active wells. As of May 28, 2010, these included 740 bay and 341 offshore wells in state waters, which extend about 10 miles offshore. Overall, that makes the inspector/wells ratio about 1-to-4,586. Agency charts show the number of wells under the commission's watch is up 11 percent from Jan. 24, 2003. 
The commission’s executive director, John Tintera, told us that the commission has sought additional inspectors, with mixed results. The Legislature nixed a request for seven inspectors in 2003, he said, but in 2009 it OK’d two new pipeline inspectors and authorized four more well inspectors, contingent on revenue from fees deposited in the state's Oilfield Cleanup Fund. However, the money needed to make the hires did not accumulate. Nye said the agency hasn't decided whether to request funding for more inspectors from the 2011 Legislature. 
In an e-mail, Weems was critical of the current staffing level: ""You cannot actively monitor that many wells - there is no way you can go by, inspect what is going on - check for leaks, condition of the premises, etc., except once every 3-5 years, and then only if you fly."" The commission's spokeswoman, Nye, said inspectors drive to well sites instead of flying. 
Tintera told us every well isn’t inspected every year; instead, inspectors focus on wells where there’s greater production or environmental sensitivity. He initially indicated the commission has enough inspectors to fulfill demands: ""What Texas needs is what we have."" 
Tintera later said the commission would ""welcome more resources, including inspectors. However, we recognize the budget constraints facing the state. Therefore the RRC prioritizes its inspections, uses outriders (inspectors who work from home) located near the oil fields they inspect to maximize efficiency, and has not included inspector positions in the hiring freeze that is currently at the agency."" 
All in all? Weems accurately recaps the number of oil wells per inspector in Texas",True,"July 15, 2010"
"""I have a record on the environment of creating green energy ... taking trash and turning it into cash.""","This one had us wondering.Vernon Jones, a Democratic candidate for Georgia's 4th Congressional District, discussed his environmental credentials at a recent candidate forum. He pointed to a program created during his days as DeKalb County's chief executive officer. In July 2005, the DeKalb County Board of Commissioners approved Jones' plan to convert methane gas into electricity from one of its landfills and sell it to Georgia Power.""I have a record on the environment of creating green energy by capturing methane gas at our landfills and selling it to Georgia Power and they in return selling it back as green energy -- taking trash and turning it into cash,"" Jones told the audience at the June 3 candidate forum in southeast Atlanta.It's been five years since the county government signed on with Georgia Power. So we decided to take a look at the initiative and see how it's working out. Is DeKalb, as Jones claimed, ""taking trash and turning it into cash""?First, a brief explanation on how this works. Landfill gas is largely composed of methane and carbon dioxide. By burning gas in boilers, Georgia Power can produce steam for power generation, according to its Web site. The company said the landfills can produce as many as 8 megawatts of electric power, enough to power eight Super Wal-Marts. More than 500 agencies across the nation have similar programs. DeKalb is doing it at the Seminole landfill, located near the county's southern edge.The environment is a big issue for Jones, who was CEO from 2001 through 2008. Jones won several awards for his efforts to preserve more green space in the county, primarily through a $125 million bond referendum that voters approved in 2001.Jones is also hoping to capitalize on a major concern in Georgia -- unemployment. His campaign slogan is ""Jobs First,"" and Jones is trying to convince voters that some of his economic development efforts, like the gas to energy program, are reasons why they should give him a shot in Washington. The state's unemployment rate in May was 10.2 percent. It was 9.5 percent a year earlier.In 2006, the county built a facility to convert the gas to electricity at a cost of $5.3 million. DeKalb has since spent $1.6 million on maintenance and operations, county spokeswoman Angela Walton said.And how much has DeKalb collected from the program? Walton said $3.9 million thus far. DeKalb projects it will collect nearly $1.1 million this year and slightly more in 2011.Some environmental protection groups, such as the Sierra Club, dispute the potential profit margin for DeKalb and other facilities that convert gas to electricity. They said the operating costs will eventually exceed profits when governments spend more money to pay for the environmental impact of methane -- which has high global warming potential -- leaking during the conversion process. (The Sierra Club said a higher percentage of methane leaks into the atmosphere when you convert gas to electricity.) The Sierra Club's board of directors voted last year to oppose the creation of any new landfill gas-to-energy facilities.""Methane is a dangerous gas that needs to be controlled,"" said Mark Woodall, the Sierra Club's Georgia chapter chairman. ""It doesn't need to be regarded as the answer to all renewable energy needs.""For the record, the Sierra Club has endorsed the incumbent congressman, Hank Johnson, in this race. Since 2006, DeKalb has spent about $6.9 million on the gas-to-electricity program. It has collected $3.9 million in revenue in that time span, with an estimated $2.1 million on the way in the next two years.Most business ventures have start-up costs, and DeKalb had some in this project. The revenue is on pace to soon exceed the start-up costs and expenses. DeKalb is, Jones said, converting ""trash into cash",Mostly True,"June 30, 2010"
"It was President Obama's ""inaction that caused over three weeks to go by before he even approved the governor's plan to protect our marsh.""","Many Republicans say President Barack Obama has moved too slowly in response to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., criticized the president's Oval Office speech and cited slow action in building sand barriers to absorb the oil.""Tonight the president actually said that he won't tolerate inaction,"" Scalise said on Sean Hannity's show on Fox News shortly after the speech on June 15, 2010. ""Yet it was his inaction that caused over three weeks to go by before he even approved the governor's plan to protect our marsh and put up those sand barriers which covered 25 percent of the plan that was submitted by our local leaders."" Scalise is referring to a plan proposed May 11 by Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal that the federal government build barrier islands of sand to intercept oil before it hit Louisiana's wetlands. The plan is based on the idea that oil is easier to get out of sand than wetlands, which are an important part of the state's ecosystems. (Read our previous ruling on Jindal's plan here.) We were interested in determining how long it took Obama to implement Gov. Jindal's plan. Now some people have questioned whether Jindal's entire plan could be completed quickly enough to capture the oil before it reached the wetlands. Some scientists have also warned that in the long term, the berms could do more harm than good. They could change coastal currents and further degrade the already extremely fragile coastline. Some suggested that construction of the berms could damage oil and gas pipelines and  that dredging the sand to build the berms could cause a change in water salinity that could harm  the fish population.Although Scalise refers to ""inaction,"" records indicate that federal agencies have been assessing the proposal since May 11.The Corps of Engineers says it received the plan at 11 p.m. on May 11. The Corps solicited interagency comments in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act, and provided those comments to the state of Louisiana. On May 14, the state resubmitted a revised plan based off of the comments. The Corps then solicited a second round of comments and began to discuss technical analyses with the state. On May 21 and May 24, the state submitted additional information, and on May 27, the plan was approved to build berms in six of the 24 proposed sections. On June 2nd, the White House approved of the idea that BP would pay and on June 3rd, BP agreed to pay the estimated $360 million cost. That certainly seems like quite a bit of action to us.According to Scalise spokesman Stephen Bell, Scalise was counting from May 11 to June 3, when BP agreed to pay, because the governor never planned to pay for the berms at the cost of the Louisiana taxpayers. According to that math, the time would be just over three weeks. But we think it's important to note that the Army Corps of Engineers approved Jindal's plan on May 27, two weeks and two days after he proposed it. And then it was June 3 when BP agreed to cover the cost. Scalise said President Obama's ""inaction ... caused over three weeks to go by before he even approved the governor's plan."" It's the word ""inaction"" here that is most troubling because it suggests nothing was going on when in fact something was happening to address Jindal's idea. Per protocol, the Corps solicited interagency comments, shared them with the state of Louisiana, received a revised plan, solicited comments on it and then approved the plan May 27.

"Canada ""does spills into their water to practice in the event that this would happen. That is not allowed in the United States.""","While discussing the continuing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico recently on Meet the Press, David Gregory asked Senator Mary Landrieu, ""Is there a problem here of a learning curve, Senator?"" Gregory added that ""we know the federal government's not equipped to stop the, the spill or plug the leak. You've got to have that level of expertise. But it does seem, and Thad Allen even referred to that in The Wall Street Journal this week, as if there is a learning curve because nobody's got the experience to deal with a large-scale spill like this."" ""We're all on a learning curve,'' Landrieu responded. ""I learned this week that Canada ... for instance, does spills into their water to practice in the event that this would happen. That is not allowed in the United States. Maybe we should think about that."" She added that ""this is like going through something where we've never had a fire drill."" We were curious about the two related claims: Whether Canada does such practice sessions in open water, and whether the United States does not. Canada does practice controlled oil spills in the open water. In a congressional hearing featuring Kevin Costner, the woman sitting to his left, Dr. Nancy Kinner, the co-director of the Coastal Response Research Center at the University of New Hampshire, mentioned that both Canada and Norway have controlled oil spills so that they can test new technologies. The United States does not share that capability with their neighbor to the north, according to Kinner. ""The United States is the only country that does oil spill R&D that has no opportunity to actually have on-water controlled spills to test technology,"" Kinner told members of Congress.  The Minerals Management Service confirms that ""the U.S. prohibits training with real oil in the open ocean or conducting testing of equipment, technologies or methodologies with real oil in the open ocean. In North America testing, training and research using real oil is conducted in test tanks and in laboratories."" According to the Evironmental Protection Agency, it is technically possible to obtain a permit to spill oil on the open ocean through the EPA, but that type of permit has not been granted for at least 20 years. As of now, the main training capability inside the U.S. is the National Oil Spill Response Research & Renewable Energy Test Facility, also known as Ohmsett. Real oil is used inside the training facility, but that is an enclosed system. The advantages of the Ohmsett system include the ability to control for all variables, allowing participants to test in a variety of different conditions. However, many experts, including Kinner, believes there is value to testing in the real world. ""I think we need to open up that possibility,'' she said, ""that we have small releases where we can have open water testing, outside of Ohmsett, to test the in real world conditions, instead of in a big test tank."" The U.S. does have the Ohmsett's testing facility, and MMS has participated in the open-water exercises in Canada and Norway, so Landrieu overstates the situation when she says it is the equivalent to never having a fire drill. Landrieu is right when she says that Canada practices in open water for oil spills, and that such testing is de facto prohibited here because the EPA has not issued a permit in two decades. Still, the application process does exist. It remains legally possible to ask for permission",Mostly True,"June 28, 2010"
"""Sen. George LeMieux voted to let oil companies off the hook and overturn pollution rules.""","In late June 2010, the Florida Conservation Alliance -- an affiliate of the League of Conservation Voters, an environmental group -- bought what it called a ""substantial"" amount of television time in the Tampa Bay area to run an ad critical of Sen. George LeMieux, R-Fla.

Here's the narration: ""It’s the worst oil disaster in American history, and Floridians are bracing for the consequences. But at a time when we need leaders who will fight for Florida’s economy and environment, Sen. George LeMieux voted to let oil companies off the hook and overturn pollution rules. Senator, when you fight to protect our coasts, we’re with you. But when you stand with Big Oil, you let us down. Call Senator LeMieux. Tell him not to disappoint us again, and to support a strong, clean energy future.""

The visuals were almost exclusively tied to the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico -- oil gushing underwater, soiled beaches, petroleum-soaked birds, the flaming Deepwater Horizon oil rig.

In this sense, the ad reminded us of one we rated recently that had been placed in several media markets by Americans United for Change, a liberal advocacy group. In both ads, the focus on the oil spill -- in both the narration and the visuals -- suggested to us that reasonable people would assume that the vote ""to let big oil off the hook"" would have something to do with the spill itself, such as a vote to limit BP's liability for paying damages.

In reality, both ads refer to a different measure in Congress -- one that has nothing directly to do with the oil spill itself.

The vote cited in an on-screen footnote was on a procedural motion to take up a joint resolution sponsored by Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. This measure would disapprove a rule submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency that classified greenhouse gasses as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act. That classification would allow the EPA to act to curb emissions by big polluters that could be causing global warming.

The resolution was the latest salvo in a fight between industry and environmentalists over curbing emissions. The EPA effort, blocked during the administration of George W. Bush, was revived after Barack Obama became president. The vote was seen as a key preliminary decision in advance of possible Senate consideration of a ""cap-and-trade"" emissions bill -- a major bone of contention between the parties.

Major oil companies could be at a competitive disadvantage if the EPA acts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, since burning oil and other fossil fuels produces a lot of carbon dioxide.

It's worth noting that the resolution failed, 47 to 53, so the Senate never really wiped out what the group terms ""protections that hold polluters accountable."" But there's little question that the vote was important. ""If ever there was a vote to find out whose side you are on, this is it,"" said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

But was it related to the oil spill? Not really. And to us, that makes it an example of an ad that isn't wrong, but is misleading.

This one deals with whether oil spills from tankers are far more common than ""very rare leaks"" from rigs or pipelines. We looked at a 2009 report produced by the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, that catalogs oil spills. Indeed, the number of spills from tankers in U.S. waters is nearly two-and-a-half times higher than those of offshore oil pipelines and oil platforms combined. Tankers also dump more than three times more oil. Two scientists who study the ocean and environment also confirmed that tankers are responsible for more spills. Here's how the numbers from the American Petroleum Institute break down:    U.S. offshore pipelines, 1969 to 2007: 506 spills, 182,355 barrels  p24    U.S. platforms, 1969 to 2007: 1,035 spills, 277,033 barrels p24    Oil tankers in U.S. waters: 3,774 spills, 1962 through 2007; 1,596,638 barrels p31U.S. Coast Guard figures on spills differ from API data but back up the overall point that tanker spills are far worse polluters than offshore oil pipelines or platforms. But are leaks from rigs or pipelines ""very rare""?  The petroleum industry's own figures indicate the U.S. has averaged more than 13 pipeline spills and 27 platform spills a year.

That's a bit lower than Markey's 25 percent. But we'll add that in 2006 and 2007, the U.S. share of world consumption was 24 percent, which is just a hair under the number Markey cited.All told, Markey would have been better off using Obama's formulation -- that the U.S. consumes ""more than 20 percent"" of the world's oil.

The most recent report of the Interior Department's Inspector General, released on May 25, 2010, found that employees of oil companies regulated by MMS footed the bill for a wide range of perks for employees of MMS' Lake Charles, La., district office. These included hunting and fishing trips; football games; and lunches. In a number of cases, the IG report named specific employees who acknowledged receiving gifts. This year's report followed a series of other IG reports that found a pattern of ethical violations -- including MMS employees' acceptance of free travel, sports tickets and ski outings -- in the agency's royalty-in-kind office. That office oversaw the collection of royalties from oil companies but did not do the kind of industry safety and environmental regulation that Obama was referring to in his Oval Office speech.Either way, this claim by the president seems to be based on solid evidence.• Were oil companies ""essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections""? There's also evidence that this happened, from testimony before a joint hearing conducted by the U.S. Coast Guard and the MMS after the spill began.In an account of the hearings, the Washington Post reported that the Deepwater Horizon oil rig that caught fire and sunk ""was registered in the Marshall Islands, a Pacific archipelago that like many jurisdictions, authorizes private organizations such as ... Det Norske Veritas to inspect vessels that operate under its flag. The owners of the oil rigs decide which of those organizations to hire, and they pay for the services.""The Post reported that when Thomas F. Heinan, deputy commissioner of maritime affairs for the Marshall Islands, was asked whether that arrangement presented a conflict of interest, he answered, ""In some persons' minds it might, but it's been a long-standing facility that's been in place for years.""The Post also reported that Coast Guard Capt. Verne B. Gifford testified that while the U.S. Coast Guard inspects oil rigs, ""it relies on the private inspectors to do the bulk of the work"" when those rigs are foreign-flagged. For those platforms, Gifford testified, the Coast Guard ""goes onboard the vessel just to verify,"" a process that ""usually takes maybe four to eight hours,"" the Post reported.This addresses inspections overseen by the Coast Guard, but there's also evidence -- somewhat less solid -- that something similar may have been happening with MMS, which was the main target of the president's comments.The IG report on MMS' Lake Charles, La., district office said that a confidential source ""told investigators that some MMS inspectors had allowed oil and gas production company personnel located on the platform to fill out inspection forms. The forms would then be completed or signed by the inspector and turned in for review. According to the source, operating company personnel completed the inspection forms using pencils, and MMS inspectors would write on top of the pencil in ink and turn in the completed form.""But while the confidential source's allegation was credible enough to include in the report, the IG's office stopped short of confirming the allegation, saying that their investigation of the original forms failed to assure them that the over-writing they found stemmed from fraudulent actions.• Were oil companies allowed to write their own regulations? This one is the murkiest of the three.In a May 10, 2010, article for McClatchy Newspapers, reporters Les Blumenthal and Erika Bolstad wrote that nearly 100 standards put together by the American Petroleum Institute -- the oil industry's trade group -- have made their way into federal offshore operating regulations. When we asked Blumenthal and Bolstad for their original source, they pointed us to a Jan 11, 2010, issue of the Federal Register.The Register -- the official daily listing of notices from federal agencies -- reported that the MMS ""is incorporating by reference the Eleventh Edition of the American Petroleum Institute's Specification for Subsurface Safety Valve Equipment (API Spec 14A) into its regulations."" It went on to explain that ""we currently incorporate by reference 97 private sector consensus standards into the offshore operating regulations.""We asked experts in federal regulation whether this sort of industry-agency collaboration was unusual, and whether it supported the president's assertion that the petroleum industry was writing its own regulations.James Gattuso, a senior research fellow in regulatory policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that this sort of technical standards-writing ""happens all the time."" ""It is quite common for regulatory agencies to adopt standards drafted, or already in use, in the private sector,"" he said. ""It is especially common in very technical areas where specific expertise in the technologies involved is needed. Agencies, of course, should be wary of self-serving or anti-competitive provisions in such standards, and should use their own judgment in adopting them. But that doesn’t make the use of such standards generally inappropriate.""Cynthia R. Farina, a Cornell University law professor and the principal investigator for the Cornell eRulemaking Initiative, agreed, saying, ""It's not unheard of for agencies to adopt voluntary consensus standards for the content of federal regulation.""It's also worth noting that the API's standards weren't slipped into federal rules at midnight in some smoke-filled room. The proposed rule was published on June 12, 2008, and for the next two months, the public had an opportunity to comment. Farina added that the regulation in question was put into place using a process that requires the Interior Department to consult with a variety of other government entities.As it turns out, only two entities did offer comments on this rule -- Baker Oil Tools and the Offshore Operators Committee. Farina calls this ""a huge problem with rulemaking in general. Certainly the absence of comments from environmentalists and neutral researchers in the area would exacerbate concerns about industry 'writing its own regulations.'""Still, MMS can't be blamed for poor response to its call for comments. That's why we think that while Obama was on solid ground with his accusations that MMS regulators were ""showered ... with gifts and favors"" and that oil companies ""were essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections,"" the notion that industry wrote its own regulations is not a slam-dunk. While Obama is technically correct that the oil industry did in several dozen cases ""write their own regulations,"" our experts agreed that industry/regulator collaboration is common across federal agencies, at least for technical matters, and that it was done in an open way that included the opportunity for public comment",Mostly True,"June 17, 2010"
"The White House has ""refused"" international help in dealing with the oil spill.","Florida Sen. George LeMieux continues to be a leading critic of President Barack Obama's handling of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.LeMieux, who was appointed to the Senate last year by Gov. Charlie Crist, has described Obama's response as ""dereliction of duty,"" and said Obama appears more interested in photo-ops than solving the crisis growing in the Gulf. LeMieux also has pressed the federal government to add more skimmer boats off Florida's coast to collect encroaching oil. Now, LeMieux claims that offers of assistance from foreign governments are going ignored by President Obama and his administration.LeMieux let out his frustration in a posting on Twitter.""State Department reports today 17 countries have offered 21 times to send aid, including skimmers,"" LeMieux wrote on June 15, 2010. ""Why has the White House refused help?""He repeated the same claim in a CNN interview on June 16.With such a scramble to contain the oil and prevent it from damaging Florida's beaches, we wondered if the federal government has been refusing offers of foreign aid.Since LeMieux says his information comes from the State Department, that's where we went to look.In a press briefing on May 19, reporters asked State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid of the possibility of international aid (The Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20). Duguid said that, at that time, 17 countries had offered some form of assistance.A reporter then asked why none of the offers had been accepted.""I don’t know that none of them have been accepted,"" Duguid said. ""I know that BP has accepted some directly without going to the U.S. The offers were mostly for booms and dispersants. There are some offers of support which come in the form of 'If you let us know what you need, we'll be happy to see if we can provide that.' There are others that were for equipment that the U.S. or BP had in supply at the time and was not running short. So there were different types of offers, and I have an understanding that BP may have accepted one or two. I don’t have the details of that.""So it was up to BP earlier? It’s not your decision?, a reporter asked.""The decision on what to accept is being done for the U.S. Government by the Coast Guard,"" Duguid said. ""They are the authoritative agency to make those decisions. BP, being a private company, can accept the help that is offered to it directly. We don’t control that. However, the expertise that is there in the Gulf is working very hard to try and contain this spill and to cap that – cap the well.""Another exchange between the State Department and reporters came a week later. State Department spokesman T.J. Crowley said 17 countries were still offering aid, as were four other entities -- the European Maritime Safety Agency, the European Commission’s Monitoring and Information Centre, the International Maritime Organization, and the Environment Unit of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the United Nations Environment Program.""My understanding is that two offers of assistance have been accepted thus far – I believe it's Mexico and Norway,"" Crowley said. ""Those offers were actually accepted by BP as part of this Unified Area Command. But we also are working internationally. I think there's assistance flowing in through private as well as public sources, so this is something that we continue to evaluate. But I would defer probably to the Coast Guard in terms of explaining the process.""A reporter then noted an apparent disconnect, with some governors calling for more booms while the federal government appears to be refusing some internationals offers for help.""Let me be clear, we are grateful for the assistance that we have been offered internationally,"" Crowley said. ""It is something that we evaluate every day. But again, I would defer to others, particularly the Coast Guard, to go through where they are in the process of evaluating particular offers.""Another series of questions followed June 9, and then again on June 14 and 15.On June 14, the State Department reported that booms from Canada had arrived in Alabama. Crowley then was asked to explain why it took weeks for some foreign offers of assistance to be accepted, and why others still hadn't.""First of all, the offers came in. Some of those offers were specific; some of those offers were general,"" Crowley said. ""Secondly, the United States Government was looking to see what are immediately available sources of relevant equipment and technology there in the Gulf region.""The State Department on June 14 released a list of the countries that offered to help -- Canada, Mexico, the Republic of Korea, Croatia, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Russia, Spain, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and Vietnam. That's 17 countries. The State Department also detailed what offers had been accepted.From Mexico -- Two skimmers and 13,780 feet of boom (accepted in early May).From Norway -- Eight skimming systems (accepted in early May).From Netherlands -- Three sets of Koseq Rigid Sweeping Arms, which attach to the sides of ships and gather oil (accepted on May 23).From Canada -- 9,843 feet of boom (accepted on June 4).On June 15, Qatar, the 18th country, offered chains of containment boom and Sweden followed up on an earlier offer to provide skimmers. State Department officials also started making a distinction about the aid -- it wasn't coming for free.""There have been some questions about these offers of assistance. For the most part, they are offers to sell supplies,"" Crowley said. ""And in determining whether to accept these offers, we look at the availability of domestic sources and also compare pricing on the open market. So that may be one of the reasons why, in some cases, we’ve been able to accept these offers and pursued them. In other cases, we’re holding them in abeyance as we continue to identify sources of important equipment that will be needed for this -- to handle this over the long term.""The Washington Post reported about the decision to accept or decline foreign aid in its June 15 edition, noting that the decision to accept foreign aid came after weeks of delay, and that foreign governments were unsure if they should contact the government or BP.In some cases, the Post reported, the administration rejected offers because they failed to meet U.S. specifications: For example, the private consortium that serves as Norway's spill-response team uses a chemical dispersant that the Environmental Protection Agency has not approved.Japan was offering protective booms and the Swedish Coast Guard was prepared to send three ships that can each collect 370 barrels of oil an hour. The Norwegian Coastal Authority, the Post reported, has approved sending nearly a third of the nation's spill response equipment to the gulf if asked. Let's tie this all together. The State Department has received official assistance offers from 18 countries and another four groups. Some of those offers are vague, others are specific. Most all of them are offers to sell equipment or use the equipment.The State Department has accepted the offers of four countries -- Mexico, Norway, Netherlands and Canada -- and says it is reviewing and considering other offers. That's in contrast to LeMieux's statement, which is that the White House has ""refused"" international aid.But it's also clear the United States has either struggled to act on offers of foreign aid, or that processing the requests has been delayed. Japan, Sweden and Norway are all prepared to send resources or manpower to the Gulf should the U.S. sign off. Other countries also are willing to help, but have been kept on the sidelines",True,"June 16, 2010"
"""Right now every single one of the (oil) companies here today and dozens of others are drilling for free in the Gulf of Mexico on leases that will cost American taxpayers more than $50 billion in lost royalties.""","The ongoing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has focused attention on a wide range of problems with the nation's regulation of how oil and other natural resources are extracted. One of those issues has to do with how much oil companies are paying the federal government for the right to drill offshore.At a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy and Environment on June 15, 2010, Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., the subcommittee chairman, took aim at the oil companies whose executives were assembled as witnesses at the hearing.One of the claims Markey made was that ""right now, every single one of the companies here today and dozens of others are drilling for free in the Gulf of Mexico on leases that will cost American taxpayers more than $50 billion in lost royalties.""We decided to see if Markey was right.At first, we thought Markey was saying that no oil company pays anything for the right to drill in the Gulf. But we knew that was not true. In a previous item we noted that the Minerals Management Service -- the office in the Interior Department charged with regulating natural-resources extraction on federal lands as well as collecting the resulting royalties -- took in just under $10 billion in royalties and other revenues in 2009, placing it in the top 10 government offices for generating federal revenue.According to MMS, Gulf of Mexico revenues for oil alone for 2009 amounted to more than $61 million for Louisiana, $1.4 million for Mississippi and more than $285,000 for Alabama.But when we took a closer look at Markey's words, we realized that he was referring to a dispute over oil lease contracts from the Clinton era. These involve two related issues. One concerns drilling leases signed in 1998 and 1999. The other concerns drilling leases signed in 1996, 1997 and 2000. It gets complicated, so bear with us.In order to promote the extraction of certain kinds of natural resources, the Interior Secretary may exercise powers under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 to grant royalty relief to drillers. In the mid 1990s, when the latter law was passed, fossil fuel prices were low, so certain types of drilling projects seemed uneconomical without government assistance. The subsidies took the form of relieving companies from having to pay federal royalties on the resources they extracted.For 1996, 1997 and 2000, the lease contracts were written in such a way that the royalty relief disappeared once the market price of oil rose above a certain level. When the price reached that level, the companies would have to start paying a royalty. But the contracts for leases agreed to in 1998 and 1999 did not include any provisions for price triggers. So regardless of how high the market price rose, no company holding a lease that was signed in one of those two years would ever owe the government a dime in royalties.During the George W. Bush administration, MMS belatedly tried to persuade leaseholders to agree to pay royalties once a price trigger was reached, and the department had some success renegotiating the contracts. But many oil companies rejected MMS' proposals to insert a price trigger.In 2008, the Government Accountability Office -- the nonpartisan, investigative arm of Congress -- estimated that upwards of $1 billion in revenues had already been foregone from the 1998 and 1999 leases. It also cited a variety of scenarios that would suggest that the loss over 25 years from the 1998 and 1999 leases could total between $4.3 billion and $14.7 billion.But remember those accurately worded contracts from the 1996, 1997 and 1998 leases? Well, it turns out they're not locked down either.In 2006, Kerr-McGee, an energy company later purchased by Anadarko Petroleum Corp., sued the government, arguing that none of the price triggers from 1996, 1997 and 2000 were valid. In 2007, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana sided with Kerr-McGee, and in 2009, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit agreed. In September 2009, the federal government, in a brief written by Solicitor General Elena Kagan (now a Supreme Court nominee), asked the Supreme Court to take up the case. But it declined, effectively letting the lower court's decision in favor of Kerr-McGee stand.We should mention that it's possible that Congress could legislate a remedy that forces the oil companies to pay royalties despite what the contracts say and what the courts have ruled. In fact, efforts to do just that are under way, and they may get a boost from popular anger over the oil spill. But the chances of such a law being enacted are only speculative at this point, so, in addition to the lost royalties from 1998 and 1999, it seems reasonable for Markey to add in the lost royalties from all five years, as he seems to have done.And how big are those three additional years worth of royalties? When the GAO surveyed the data in 2008, the agency suggested that the government would have to refund more than $1 billion in royalties already collected, in addition to forgoing billions of dollars more that had been expected to materialize over the next 25 years. Reports by the GAO and the Congressional Research Service, Congress' nonpartisan research arm, offered wildly varying estimates, from a low of almost $16 billion to a high $60 billion.The fact is, forecasting the market price of energy -- not to mention the future production from drill sites -- as far as 25 years into the future means that even the best experts can make little more than educated guesses. Oil prices in particular are notoriously volatile even in the short term, much less on the scale of a quarter century.In the report, GAO itself urged the utmost of caution in assessing these various scenarios. The ranges for lost revenue ""should not be viewed as probabilistic estimates of what actual forgone royalties will be, or even firm boundaries within which forgone royalties will fall. Rather, the scenarios reflect reasonable possibilities based on recent experience and possible future prices.""So where does this leave Markey's comment? It's on the right track, but we do have some quibbles with it.First, he would have been better served if he'd chosen his words more carefully. We think a reasonable person hearing his statement -- but unaware of the controversy over the lease language -- would come away thinking that no oil company pays a dime for anything it pumps out of the Gulf. In reality, the companies pay tens of millions of dollars a year just to extract oil in the Gulf alone.Second, we believe Markey cites the $50 billion figure a little too blithely. He picked a number on the high end of an estimate range that will be subject to lots of cross-cutting influences over the next quarter-century -- first and foremost the volatile price of oil. If he'd said ""leases that could cost American taxpayers more than $50 billion in lost royalties"" -- rather than ""will cost"" -- he would have been on much safer ground.In an interview, Markey's office noted that the comment we fact-checked was an opening statement that summarized topics the hearing would address, and that lawmakers and witnesses proceeded to cover the topic of lost royalties in greater detail later in the hearing. They added that in Markey's view, the higher range of the estimate seems more likely based on their reading of oil price trends.But they acknowledged that the estimates are just that -- estimates and overall, we think many listeners would come away with the impression that the federal government was not getting any royalties when, in fact, the companies pay tens of millions of dollars a year just for drilling in the Gulf. In our view, Markey's comment, while broadly accurate, would have benefited from better specificity",Half True,"June 16, 2010"
"""While Exxon Mobil has 40 pages on its media response strategy, its plan for resource protection is only five pages long and its plan for oil removal is just nine pages long.""","At a Congressional hearing looking at how oil companies respond to oil spills, here was an unlikely claim: Exxon Mobil's emergency plan for dealing with an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has 40 pages on how to deal with the media, but only nine pages on how to clean up a spill.The statement sounded improbable to us. Isn't answering media questions easier than cleaning up a major oil spill? So we decided to check it out. The hearings, held June 16, 2010, were aimed at letting members of Congress grill the oil executives on their plans, and they were held by the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee chaired by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif. Another Congressman, Bart Stupak, was particularly concerned about how similar the clean-up plans of all the major oil companies seemed to be. ""It could be said that BP is the one bad apple in the bunch,"" Stupak said. ""But, unfortunately, they appear to have plenty of company. Exxon and other oil companies are just as unprepared to respond to a major oil spill in the Gulf as BP.""He singled out Exxon Mobil, though, for particular criticism. Unlike the rest of the companies, Stupak said, Exxon Mobil devoted 40 pages to how to handle the media, everything from suggested statements to pre-written press releases to instructions on directing questions about global warning and the Exxon Valdez spill to corporate headquarters. ""While Exxon Mobil has 40 pages on its media response strategy, its plan for resource protection is only five pages long and its plan for oil removal is just nine pages long,"" Stupak said.""If a public affairs officer is asked about criminal charges, the plan instructs them to say, 'We believe that there are no grounds for such charges. This was clearly an accident and we are working to respond to the immediate needs of the incident,' "" the Michigan Democrat added. ""That talking point is ready to go before a hypothetical incident even occurs, before Exxon Mobil could have any idea of whether it was actually an accident or if there are any grounds for criminal charges. In short, Exxon Mobil has meticulously anticipated virtually every conversation that the company might need to have with the media in the days following an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.""The committee released the reports of the companies as part of their investigation. So we reviewed Exxon Mobil's 663-page plan to see if Stupak's description was accurate or exaggerated for effect. First, we'll look at the section on how Exxon handles the media. It starts on page 557 with Appendix K and continues to page 596. That's 39 pages. And just as Stupak said, it contains detailed outlines for roles and responsibilities involving the media. Questions about global warming and the Exxon Valdez are categorized as including ""sensitive corporate issues"" that should be handled by Exxon headquarters.""Category D requires referral to EMCorp for response and should not be included in press releases or response statements issued from site/region or Functional HQ,"" the document said. The appendix also includes sample press releases and suggested statements for an index of topics. Yes, it does have the pre-written denial of grounds for criminal charges. So Stupak is right about the press section of the document. BP's media section, by the way, is only six pages long. Chevron's is five pages, ConocoPhillips' is five pages and Shell's is four pages.Next, we looked at Section 13 in the Exxon plan, which is ""Resource Protection Methods."" It runs from pages 330 to 334, which is five pages. It includes a list of things the company might do to protect wildlife, everything from the deployment of several types of booms, using chemical dispersants and ""in situ"" burning (burning oil to prevent spreading) to removing sea turtle nests and playing the recorded sounds of live birds. We also looked at Section 15, ""Oil and Debris Removal Procedures."" It runs from pages 350 to 358, or nine pages. It includes some of the same elements as the previous section, including the use of booms, chemical dispersants and burning.So Stupak is largely correct in his descriptions. We did notice that a few of the elements described in those sections, though, were explained in greater length in other sections of the report. There are an additional seven pages on wildlife rehabilitation, an additional 23 pages on using chemical dispersants, and another 14 pages on burning. So that's an additional 44 pages.We asked Exxon Mobil for a response on Stupak's charges, but we didn't hear back. During the hearing, Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson didn't directly address why the media section was so long. But he did defend the fact that all of the oil companies' plans are highly similar to BP's plan.""You know, the aspect of the plan, the cookie-cutter characterization, should not come as much of a surprise, because the industry has relied on sharing of resources -- boats, booms, skimmer equipment. And in working with the Coast Guard and federal agencies, what we really should have is a unified plan. Because it doesn't matter whose well has the problem, when it has the problem, we need to be able to respond with everything we have available. So those plans look the same because in fact they call upon the same resources to respond,"" Tillerson said.In rating Stupak's statement, we find he is largely accurate in his description that the Exxon Mobil plan ""has 40 pages on its media response strategy"" while its plan for resource protection ""is only five pages long and its plan for oil removal is just nine pages long."" We did notice that other sections of the plan expand on some of the topics listed in resource protection and oil removal. Nevertheless, Exxon's media plan is highly detailed and lengthy, particularly when compared with the other oil company plans and other sections of its own report",Mostly True,"June 16, 2010"
"Since 2000, ""the Texas clean air program achieved a 22 percent reduction in ozone and a 46 percent decrease in NOx emissions.""","It's Gov. Rick Perry vs. Washington again, this time in a battle over Texas' compliance with the federal Clean Air Act. A day after the state filed suit to stop the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from taking over parts of the state program that issues permits for companies to foul the air, Perry touted afresh Texas' progress in reducing pollution levels. Since 2000, Perry said in a press release issued Tuesday, ""the Texas clean air program (has) achieved a 22 percent reduction in ozone and a 46 percent decrease in NOx (nitrogen oxide) emissions."" The same statistic was cited by Perry in a May 28 letter to President Barack Obama and mentioned in news accounts such as a New York Times article published online June 9. Sounds good, but what do the figures mean? And does the state deserve credit for improvements? First, let's look at the basic science. A goal of the federal Clean Air Act is to reduce the levels of what EPA calls ""commonly found air pollutants."" Among those is ground-level ozone, which forms when nitrogen oxide emissions mix with volatile organic compounds in the presence of sunlight and heat. Common sources of nitrogen oxides: cars and trucks, power plants and industrial boilers. EPA sets limits on the concentration of ozonethe primary component of smog, in the air. Areas that fail to meet the standard are designated in ""nonattainment."" Under the Clean Air Act, the state is required to submit plans to EPA that outline how it will clean up areas and meet the federal standard. Katherine Cesinger, a spokeswoman for the governor's office, said Perry's May letter to Obama focuses on ozone levels and nitrogen oxide emissions because ""ozone is the only thing that we are in nonattainment for the state. And NOx is a precursor to ozone, so it makes sense to highlight that."" Experts agreed with that reasoning. David Allen, a professor of chemical engineering at the University of Texas, said: ""Controlling NOx emissions is, in general, the most effective strategy for reducing ozone in Texas. So, the governor was right to focus on NOx."" The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality provided us with data showing a 46 percent reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxide from industrial sources such as chemical plants, refineries and electric utility plants between 2000 and 2006. Considering the drop through 2008, the decrease was even bigger: 53 percent. However, industrial sources account for only about a fourth of NOx emissions in Texas. Most come from road vehicles, ships and airplanes, as well as smaller sources such as gas stations and dry cleaners. Susana Hildebrand, TCEQ's chief engineer, told us Perry referenced industrial sources of pollution because that's mainly what the state regulates; the federal government regulates mobile sources. Considering all sources of nitrogen oxide emissions, the total fell 26 percent between 2002 and 2008. (The reduction since 2000 was not available.) As for ozone itself, establishing that statewide measure is complicated. There are about 70 regulatory ozone monitors in Texas, primarily in urban areas, almost all located on or east of the Interstate 35 corridor. The statewide measure is the three-year average of ozone levels from sites with some of the highest readings. TCEQ said it believes the sites were all in Houston or Dallas. The data show a 22 percent reduction in ozone between 2000 and 2008. In short, said UT's Allen, Perry's ozone figure is in line with what the agency and university researchers have found. ""All of these measurements paint a consistent picture. Ozone concentrations are going down across the state,"" he said. Still, some parts of Texas have struggled to meet federal ozone standards. Three regions are currently designated in nonattainment under a limit set by EPA in 1997: Dallas-Forth Worth (nine counties), Houston (eight counties), and Beaumont-Port Arthur (four counties). According to TCEQ, the Beaumont area is being reclassified as in compliance and the Houston area met the standard for the first time in 2009. But a tightening of EPA standards, expected in August, will likely put several more areas, including the five-county Austin region, out of compliance. Next, to what degree were the reductions in ozone and NOx achieved by the state's ""clean-air program""? Allen said that it's difficult to say ""quantitatively"" whether federal or state regulations were primarily responsible. Indeed, we found disagreement among experts on that front. Hildebrand, of TCEQ, said state efforts deserve full credit for the industrial NOx emission reductions, pointing to initiatives designed to bring regions into compliance with federal ozone standards. An example: the Mass Emissions Cap and Trade program, in place in Houston since 2001, which limits NOx emissions from large sources. But Neil Carman, clean air program director of the environmental group Sierra Club of Texas, said the federal government deserves the vast majority of the credit for reducing industrial NOx pollution because state actions have been driven by the Clean Air Act. And vehicle emissions, which are regulated by the feds and are a greater source of NOx pollution than industrial sources, have gone down as well -- 40 percent by TCEQ's measure between 2002 and 2008. Hildebrand acknowledged that has helped improve Texas' ozone picture. Al Armendariz of Dallas, administrator of EPA's multi-state Region 6, which includes Texas, credited all levels of government with hastening the ozone improvements, especially in Dallas and Houston. As examples, he pointed to enforcement actions taken against industry by the federal government that led to facilities' agreeing to major cuts in emissions, as well as state initiatives. The state touts incentive-driven programs such as its Emission Reduction Plan, which has spent more than $760 million since 2000 to help companies retrofit or replace more than 12,000 diesel vehicles with cleaner-burning ones. Despite the ozone improvements, a report released April 28 by the American Lung Association ranked the Houston area as the seventh-worst in the nation for ozone pollution and Dallas-Fort Worth 13th. (The worst six places for ozone were in California.) Of the 30 Texas counties graded by the lung association on their ozone pollution, 21 -- including Travis -- received F's. So how does Perry's statement hold up? The governor accurately cites recent improvements in the state's ozone levels. As for the NOx emissions contributing to ozone levels, his statistic refers to only one source -- industrial -- which he did not note. Nearly three-quarters comes from other sources. Whether the state gets the credit for those improvements is another issue. Even if TCEQ is responsible for the drop in industrial NOx emissions, federal efforts -- namely vehicle emission regulations -- also have helped lower ozone levels. Significantly, the state's ozone-related programs exist to help Texas comply with federal expectations",Half True,"June 16, 2010"

""The problem for Democrats is that debating the Democrat cap-and-trade bill might not fit neatly into the White House messaging plan, since it’s been widely reported that a major part of the Kerry-Lieberman bill was essentially written by BP. This is clearly an inconvenient fact: an administration that seems to spend most of its time coming up with new ways to show how angry it is with BP is pushing a proposal that BP helped write.""

McConnell touched on a lot of points in this excerpt, but the one that most interested us was whether ""a major part of the Kerry-Lieberman bill was essentially written by BP.""

When we asked McConnell's office for evidence to support this charge, a spokesman provided us with links to several news reports. These stories -- published over the past few months in the Washington Post, in the Capitol Hill newspaper The Hill, and in the energy-and-environment trade publication Greenwire -- offer ample evidence that BP was involved in the long-running negotiations over the bill, and that the company spoke favorably about the measure as it was being drafted.

The articles indicated that BP, along with Shell, ConocoPhillips and the Edison Electric Institute, would ultimately endorse the measure. In fact, one article specifically noted that BP CEO Tony Hayward -- not yet the internationally known face of the disaster -- gave a speech at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in March in which he ""indicated he was encouraged"" by the Kerry-Lieberman effort.

Aides to Kerry and Lieberman do not dispute that BP was involved in the negotiations, along with many other parties.

""The senators met with more than 60 of their colleagues and all involved stakeholders, including environmentalists, religious leaders and the business community,"" said Whitney Smith, a spokeswoman for Kerry.

""The senators worked with a diverse set of colleagues and stakeholders to develop their discussion draft,"" added Lieberman spokesman Marshall Wittmann. ""They met with the CEOs of Shell, BP and Conoco because their industry will be regulated under the bill and it was important to ensure that the bill's approach to transportation emissions would reduce oil dependence. They also met with members of the business and environmental community in an effort to ensure that the bill met all of their goals: to grow the economy, create jobs and clean our air.""

But it's one thing for a company's representatives to meet with Congressional aides, make the company's case and suggest that they may endorse a bill. It's another to actually write legislation. On this point, Kerry and Lieberman's offices are clear: ""Senators, not any industry, wrote this proposal, and any suggestion to the contrary is false and politically motivated,"" said Smith, the spokeswoman for Kerry.

Let's delve into the evidence.

On March 24, Houston Chronicle energy blogger Tom Fowler reprinted a ""discussion draft"" by BP that advocated several policy positions related to hydraulic fracking. That's a technique that allows energy companies to unlock natural gas by injecting chemicals into underground reservoirs. Critics have suggested that the procedure risks tainting adjoining water supplies, and they have urged lawmakers to establish tight controls on the process.

As reprinted in Fowler's blog, the ""discussion draft"" argued that ""governments and industry have critical roles toward continuing to assure the public that hydraulic fracturing operations are effectively managed and regulated and that human health and the environment are protected."" Among other things, the draft sought to maintain ""the confidentiality of trade secret information.""

However, this language was not included in the draft bill that Kerry and Lieberman released a month later. Quite the opposite: The bill draft said that ""a hydraulic fracturing service company shall disclose all chemical constituents used in a hydraulic fracturing operation to the public on the Internet in order to provide adequate information for the public and state and local authorities"" -- a much more stringent standard than that sought by BP.

It's also worth noting that the BP ""discussion draft"" was not even intended to be actual language in the bill. Rather, it was intended as language for a ""Sense of the Senate"" resolution, which, unlike the law itself, is not binding.

BP also sought a federal pre-emption for automobile tailpipe emissions, said Jeremy Symons, senior vice president at the National Wildlife Federation. That means that BP wanted the federal government to set a universal standard for emissions, rather than having states set their own levels, which could allow some states -- especially California -- to set stricter limits. Such a policy has been a longstanding item on the industry's agenda for climate change regulation.

In this case, too, the Kerry-Lieberman draft bill specifically maintained the right of states to set emissions limits, leaving BP's idea on the cutting-room floor.

And BP and other players in the industry proposed increasing gasoline taxes at the pump rather than curbing vehicular emissions through a direct cap, said John Coqueyt, a legislative specialist with the Sierra Club, an environmental group. After making progress initially, this idea was abandoned in the Kerry-Lieberman draft, Coqueyt said.

""On the one hand, BP did have substantial input into the Kerry bill,"" said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign at the Center for Auto Safety. BP, other oil companies, the Edison Electric Institute and other industry groups ""submitted much language and many ideas. Some are probably recognizable in the current bill. ... But I don't think it is accurate to say that BP essentially wrote a major part of the bill.""

We agree. There's no question that BP, by taking a cooperative stance with Kerry and Lieberman rather than an adversarial one, had the opportunity to float its ideas during the legislative drafting process. And by dangling the possibility that the company might back the bill -- which would provide the senators with politically valuable support on a complicated and contentious bill -- BP and other energy companies wielded some leverage in the drafting process. In fact, many on the left -- not just conservatives like McConnell-- are disappointed that Kerry and other Democratic supporters of climate change legislation worked with oil companies, including BP, while crafting the bill. But saying that the senators listened to BP's case is not the same as saying that ""a major part"" of the bill ""was essentially written by BP.""

In fact, looking at three BP-pushed initiatives that have come to light shows that none were included in the current draft of the bill, which suggests that the senators and their aides were hardly captive to BP. It may be revealing that one day after the statement we're checking, McConnell had toned down his description of BP's role. In a floor speech on June 10, 2010, McConnell said, ""Some favor the Kerry-Lieberman cap-and-trade bill, a significant portion of which, by the way, has been pushed by the oil company BP."" If he'd simply said ""pushed"" the day before, he would have been pretty close to being accurate. But McConnell went much further when he said that BP had ""essentially written"" a ""major part"" of the bill",False,"June 14, 2010"
"""Rick Perry attempted to fast-track unnecessary coal-fired power plants, which degrade air quality and would cost billions. Fortunately, a court stopped him.""","
Bill White, the Democratic nominee for governor, recently blasted his opponent's environmental record, saying in a May 17 press release: ""Rick Perry attempted to fast-track unnecessary coal-fired power plants, which degrade air quality and would cost billions. Fortunately, a court stopped him."" 
We wondered if White's salvo is on target. 
Some history: Perry issued his so-called fast-tracking order Oct. 27, 2005, ""to encourage diversity of energy supply."" The order told the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, which is responsible for judging requests for permits to pollute the air, to ""prioritize and expedite the processing of environmental permit applications that are protective of the public health and environment and propose to use Texas' natural resources to generate electrical power."" 
The order, issued as natural gas prices climbed and after Hurricane Katrina disrupted natural gas production, shortened administrative hearings on permits, which normally took about a year, to six months. At the time, Perry said he was hoping to spare electricity consumers from rate shocks due to the surging price of natural gas. 
A few months later, TXU Corp., a Dallas-based energy company, announced plans to double its power production by building eight coal-fired units. Company executives were joined by Perry at their April 2006 press conference, according to the Dallas Morning News. The company, which had submitted a permit application for two new coal-units in July 2005 and had plans to build another unit permitted by the state in 2003, said it would cost $10 billion to complete all 11 units. TXU also promised to cut emissions of pollutants including sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide and mercury by 20 percent, saying it would spend $500 million on equipment to control pollution at three of its existing coal-fired units in Texas. 
In a Sept. 8, 2006, press release, Perry defended his order and TXU's proposal, saying ""the TXU plants are important to diversifying our energy supply so Texans do not face rate shock every time natural gas prices spike up."" 
TXU was then the state's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, one of several greenhouse gases widely thought to be fueling global warming. The utility acknowledged the proposed plants would emit 78 million tons of carbon dioxide per year, in addition to the 55 million tons per year company plants were already emitting, according to the Morning News. 
Where was White as Perry aligned with TXU? As Houston's mayor, White opposed the eight proposed units as a member of the Texas Cities for Clean Air Coalition, which was formed by then-Dallas Mayor Laura Miller in August 2006 to challenge coal-fired power plant pollution. In September 2006, the Houston Chronicle quoted White saying: ""We need to make sure that power plants built for today have minimal emissions and contributions to global warming, the greenhouse gases, where we will see increasing regulation in this country, and in other countries, in the future."" 
TXU and anti-coal groups faced off for and against the proposed plants, while four groups consisting of people living near proposed plant sites sued Perry, calling his executive order unconstitutional. And in February 2007, a state district judge blocked it, saying Perry overstepped his constitutional authority in ""directing a hearing officer to hold a hearing and reach a decision by a particular deadline."" The judge issued an injunction that restored power to administrative law judges to delay a hearing on TXU's permit application. The judges then postponed the hearing until June of that year. 
Next came a big twist. In the following months, TXU was bought out by private owners, who quickly withdrew requests for permits to build eight of the 11 coal-fired units. In June 2007, the commission granted a permit for the two surviving units, going against an administrative judge's recommendation that the agency reconsider its approval after TXU failed to prove that technology to be used at the plant would effectively control emissions. 
Of late, Texas utilities — not including Luminant (formerly TXU) — are seeking permits for five more proposed coal-fired and petroleum coke-fired plants. 
So, Perry issued his speed-up order, which was canceled by a judge, as White says. Also as he says, the 11 coal-fired power units that TXU wanted to construct were expected to cost billions. 
Finally, let's circle back to White's contention that the plants were unnecessary. That's debatable. 
In 2006, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which manages the power grid that serves most of Texas, forecast that the state needed fuel diversity to offset its dependence on natural gas, and new sources of energy to keep up with electricity demand — a tenet of Perry's 2005 order. 
However, anti-coal opponents who led the lawsuit against Perry's order argue that even if the state needed to generate more electricity, it should have come from cleaner energy sources such as wind power. Nathan Melson, president of Citizens Organizing for Resources and Environment, a nonprofit that organized in 2006 against TXU's proposed coal-fired plant in Savoy (about 70 miles north of Dallas), and one of the groups that sued Perry said: ""We've all got to have electricity and we all have to live, but we ought to be looking at other technology out there."" 
Another indicator: Whether electricity demand would have been met without the requested plants. Generally, ERCOT says, a reserve margin of at least 12.5 percent above the state's peak electricity demand is necessary to spare Texas customers frequent power outages. 
Theresa Gage, an ERCOT representative, told us she didn't know of any instance when ERCOT has operated below the reserve margin. ""However, in 2006, projections showed that by 2009, with no new generation brought online... ERCOT would drop below the 12.5 percent margin,"" she said. ""The 11 TXU plants — the three that were built and the eight that were not — would all have contributed to pushing the reserve margin to and above 12.5 percent."" 
In the meantime, other power sources have filled the gap. Some 127 units have come online since 2006, adding 14,494 megawatts of power to the state's grid. About half of the added capacity is coming from wind energy, which generates 7,318 megawatts of power, trailed by gas (4,251 megawatts) and coal (2,913 megawatts). 
""We're where we need to be,"" Gage said. And On White's campaign spokeswoman Katy Bacon said that because Texas has generation capacity greatly exceeding ERCOT's recommended reserve margin, the state never needed the eight plants contemplated by TXU. 
In contrast, Catherine Frazier, a spokeswoman for Perry's campaign, said that ""construction of some of those (TXU-sought) plants is precisely why we're not looking at power shortages today."" The three TXU coal-fired units that ended up getting built provide a combined 2,141 megawatts of power, according to ERCOT. ""If you remove them from the calculation, then we are below the 12.5 percent margin starting in 2013, and below the 10 percent margin by 2015,"" Frazier said, citing ERCOT's projections. 
Unsaid: One of those units Frazier referenced had a permit two years before Perry issued his order and TXU had already applied for permits for the other two. His order didn't affect the first plant, but the other two stood to benefit from the expedited process, according to the TCEQ. 
Where does all this leave White's statement? 
Perry tried to speed up the environmental-permitting process for utilities and his order was later blocked by a court. Also, those plants would have cost billions. 
Whether the plants were unnecessary, as White puts it, depends on whose argument rings your bell. White is right in that plants fueled by other sources helped satisfy the state's electricity needs. Yet he's wrong if the few coal-fired plants that were completed helped Texas avoid a demand crisis. We're calling it a draw",Mostly True,"June 7, 2010"
"Says EPA regulation of greenhouse gases will endanger 575 Texas dairy facilities, 58 swine operations, 1,300 corn farms and 28,000 beef cattle operations.","Todd Staples, the state agriculture commissioner, this year joined Gov. Rick Perry and Attorney General Greg Abbott in objecting to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency designating half a dozen greenhouse gases as endangering public health. Staples says on his campaign website, which we visited in late May, that he’s fighting the December “endangerment” finding because the consequences would be disastrous for Texas farmers who, he implies, would suffer from government monitoring and regulation of gases emitted by animals and equipment. “Companies that will be endangered in Texas include 575 dairy facilities, 58 swine operations (and) 1,300 corn farms,"" Staples says. ""No industry is more threatened than the cattle industry. If this rule is implemented, an estimated 28,000 beef cattle operations in Texas will fall under EPA regulation.” Milk, pigs, corn, cows – the feds whuppin' all these grown-in-Texas products? We wondered if Staples plows a straight row. Cody McGregor, Staples’ campaign manager, said the commissioner, a Republican seeking re-election, derived his Texas figures from a July 2008 letter written by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in response to the EPA’s draft advance notice to regulate greenhouse gases. In its letter, the USDA said that if greenhouse gas emissions were regulated under the Clean Air Act, numerous farms then not required to seek gas-emission permits would be so burdened. The 1970 act directs the EPA to establish air quality standards; the law requires the agency to concentrate on major polluters, which are defined as those that emit more than 100 tons of unhealthful pollutants a year. The  USDA letter says that even “very small agricultural operations"" would fall in that category: ""For example, dairy facilities and farms with over 500 acres of corn may need to get a Title V permit. It is neither efficient nor practical to require permitting and reporting of (greenhouse gas) emissions from farms of this size. Excluding only the 200,000 largest commercial farms, our agricultural landscape is comprised of 1.9 million farms with an average value of production of $25,589 on 271 acres.” O June 23, 2009, Staples sent a letter to Lisa Jackson, the EPA administrator, objecting to the greenhouse gas endangerment finding. That letter says that based on the USDA’s herd and acreage estimates, Texas in 2007 had approximately 575 dairy facilities, 28,000 beef cattle operations, 58 swine operations and 1,300 corn farms that met the “regulatory threshold.” So, Staples aired his Texas estimate nearly a year ago based on the USDA’s assessment of the impact of EPA plans to regulate greenhouse gases drafted about a year before that. Presuming his math is solid, we wondered if the nearly 2-year-old concerns shared by USDA still hold. To our queries, Staples did not say precisely why or how the EPA's permitting will endanger the Texas operations he tallies. In Washington, EPA spokeswoman Catherine Milbourn looked over the information provided by Staples’ campaign. She said the analyses reflect expectations about the EPA’s plans that are no longer valid because the EPA effectively excused farms from complying with the requirements cited in the USDA’s letter. EPA spokesman Brendan Gilfillan followed up with an e-mail: “These types of doomsday scenarios are simply untrue. EPA issued a rule that would specifically ensure small businesses and farms are shielded from clean air act permitting for” greenhouse gases. The EPA’s May 13 final ""tailoring rule,"" a descriptive reflecting the agency's decision not to impose the same pollutant thresholds on greenhouse gases that were spelled out for pollutants in the Clean Air Act, specifies the types of entities that will initially have to toe the line on greenhouse gas emissions. An accompanying fact sheet states: “Facilities responsible for nearly 70 percent of the national (greenhouse gas) emissions from stationary sources will be subject to permitting requirements under this rule. This includes the nation’s largest (greenhouse gas) emitters—power plants, refineries, and cement production facilities. Emissions from small farms, restaurants, and all but the very largest commercial facilities will not be covered by these programs at this time.” At this time? The fact sheet says the EPA is committing to additional rule-making by July 2012 which may discuss “whether certain smaller sources can be permanently excluded from permitting.” Permits for smaller sources of any type won't be required until at least April 30, 2016, the agency says. In a May 13 blog post headlined ""EPA Greenhouse Gas Rules Likely Target for Suits,"" Legal Times magazine in Washington notes that the Clean Air Act requires entities that emit 100 to 250 tons of pollutants per year to get government permits to do so. Because greenhouse gases are emitted in much larger quantities than traditional pollutants, the 100 to 250 ton threshold would require permits for small farms, restaurants and apartment buildings, for example. In raising the threshold, the agency is admitting the absurdity of applying the lower limits to more prevalent greenhouse gases, the blog says. McGregor of Staples’ campaign conceded the EPA's May 13 rule excludes farms. McGregor said, however, that what the EPA says today ""can likely change tomorrow."" He pointed us to an online analysis of the rule by Washington lawyer Richard Stoll, whose clients include industrial operators including Portland cement manufacturers. Stoll told us he expects the rule to be challenged in federal court because the pollutant thresholds in the rule are far above what the Clean Air Act mandates. More broadly, Stoll said, the EPA wants Congress to pass laws related to greenhouse gas regulation; one way of touching off such action is to issue rules likely to be tossed in court. “There is a good chance that the DC circuit (court) will throw that regulation out and then all of a sudden EPA is going to be confronted with having to do something about all these farms and everything (else),” Stoll said. “There’s grounds to be fearful here.” However, Stoll said, should the EPA ever get to the point of requiring farmers to monitor and report on localized gas emissions, Congress almost certainly will intervene. ""If all of a sudden you’re having farmers worried about monitoring cow farts, Congress will be all over this,"" he said. ""It might not be immediately; it could be a damn mess for a while."" Shannon Goessling, executive director and chief legal counsel of the conservative-leaning Southeastern Legal Foundation, which has challenged the endangerment finding, contends the EPA had another reason for excusing farms and other small businesses from greenhouse gas regulation: The government hopes they will drop their resistance to the endangerment finding. There's another legal view. Melinda Taylor, former director of the Environmental Law Clinic at the University of Texas School of Law, agreed with Stoll that the EPA wants Congress to step in and take on greenhouse gas emissions. But, she said, it’s also likely the EPA would prevail in court if its May 13 rule is challenged. Generally, she said, “courts will not substitute their own judgment for that of an agency.” Besides, she said, “farmers have always been very successful in making the case they can’t comply with regulations that would be onerous and inordinately costly to them — to the detriment of the environment, I might add.” Phew. Where does all this leave Staples’ statement? The commish had a basis for his numbers in the 2008 USDA letter. But his assumption that farms would be subject to the regulations expired when the EPA issued its final rule weeks ago. Since, Staples has neither adjusted nor reasonably explained his outdated complaint",False,"June 7, 2010"
"""Barbara Boxer's worried about the weather"" instead of terrorism as the biggest threat to national security.","The latest ad from California Senate candidate Carly Fiorina -- who is running in the Republican primary to take on incumbent Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer -- mocks Boxer for saying in 2007 that ""one of the very important national security issues frankly is climate change.""
 
After playing a clip of Boxer's statement, Fiorina faces the camera and responds, ""Terrorism kills, and Barbara Boxer's worried about the weather.""
 
No one doubts that Boxer made the comment. But we wanted to check the context of Boxer's remark and see if Fiorina was quoting it accurately. We examined three elements:
 
• How well-accepted is the idea of climate change as a national security threat?

Sufficiently well-established to have been been promoted by both the Pentagon and CIA.
 
A Quadrennial Defense Review Report issued by the Department of Defense in February 2010 states that ""assessments conducted by the intelligence community indicate that climate change could have significant geopolitical impacts around the world, contributing to poverty, environmental degradation, and the further weakening of fragile governments. Climate change will contribute to food and water scarcity, will increase the spread of disease, and may spur or exacerbate mass migration."" It concludes that ""while climate change alone does not cause conflict, it may act as an accelerant of instability or conflict, placing a burden to respond on civilian institutions and militaries around the world.""
 
Meanwhile, on Sept. 25, 2009, the CIA announced the launch of a Center on Climate Change and National Security. According to a CIA press release announcing the launch, the center's charter ""is not the science of climate change,"" but rather ""the national security impact of phenomena such as desertification, rising sea levels, population shifts, and heightened competition for natural resources.""

So while there is certainly room for disagreement about how big a national security threat climate change will ultimately be, Boxer is hardly advocating a fringe theory. The notion that climate change will be significant is being discussed at the Pentagon and the CIA.

• Is it fair to say that Boxer's concern about climate change amounts to being ""worried about the weather""?

This comment conflates two concepts that people often confuse, but are actually quite different.

""Weather"" refers to daily variations in sun, precipitation, wind, heat and cold. ""Climate,"" by contrast, refers to typical atmospheric patterns over a much longer time scale. The Merriam-Webster online dictionary defines ""climate"" as ""the average course or condition of the weather at a place usually over a period of years as exhibited by temperature, wind velocity, and precipitation."" A more lighthearted explanation is ""climate is what you expect; weather is what you get.""

We asked 10 experts -- a mix of governmental and academic climate scientists, broadcast meteorologists and climate policy specialists at think tanks -- whether there is a broad consensus among their peers that weather and climate are different concepts. They all agreed that there is.

""There is no debate between scientists and meteorologists, as the terms 'weather' and 'climate' are not interchangeable,"" said Drew Jackson, a former meteorologist with KPTV-TV in Portland, Ore. ""Scientists, meteorologists and climatologists fully understand that.""

The closest that one of our experts came to detecting some justification in Fiorina's conflation of the two fields came in comments by Samuel Thernstrom, a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. He noted that climate change does cause changes in weather, meaning that Fiorina's statement is ""not necessarily inaccurate."" But even he added that her phrasing in the ad ""is pejorative and arguably misleading,"" and we agree.

• By focusing on the threat of climate change, did Boxer somehow ignore the issue of terrorism?

We should begin by noting that Boxer chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which gives her a key perch for discussing environmental issues. She's also on the Foreign Relations Committee, but does not sit on either Homeland Security or Armed Services, two panels that more directly address terrorism.

In addition, it's not clear to us that having concern over climate change and terrorism are mutually exclusive. Still, we think it's valid to review Boxer's record on terrorism.
 
Critics point to her 2007 vote against a supplemental funding bill for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as evidence she is soft on terrorism. Boxer said she voted against it for tactical reasons -- she and some of her fellow Democrats were seeking to tie further war funding to a more explicit troop withdrawal date. The critics also cite her votes against $86 billion for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2003, as well as her vote against the use of military force in Iraq in 2002.

At the same time, opponents accuse Boxer of being soft on the treatment of terrorism suspects. In 2006, for example, Boxer voted to preserve habeas corpus rights for Guantanamo detainees. She also voted in 2006 against extending the wiretapping provision of the PATRIOT Act.

On the other hand, Boxer's campaign offers a number of initiatives she's made on terrorism, including:
 
• Leading a bipartisan coalition in 2002 to pass an amendment allowing commercial airline pilots to carry guns in cockpits and providing flight crews self-defense training. She also wrote a law to put more air marshals on high-risk flights, such as the nonstop cross-country flights that were hijacked on Sept. 11.

• Voting for President Barack Obama's economic stimulus package, which included more than $300 million to strengthen port security, public transportation security and railroad security. It also included $680 million to strengthen border security and $1 billion for airport security.
 
• Cosponsoring of the Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions Act, to give the president expanded authority to impose new economic penalties on foreign firms involved in the export of gasoline and other refined petroleum products to Iran.
 
• Voting in 2009 for a war supplemental spending bill proposed by Obama to fund a troop surge in Afghanistan. ""I am voting for this bill not because I want the U.S. to remain bogged down in two wars but because I want to give this administration, the Obama Administration, the resources it needs to successfully end the wars starting with the war in Iraq,"" Boxer said in a floor speech. ""Furthermore, I do not support an open-ended commitment of American troops to Afghanistan, and if we do not see measurable progress, we must reconsider our engagement and our strategy there.""
 
• Voting in 2007 to implement the 9/11 Commission report.

• Supporting a bill to establish a global strategy to defeat al-Qaida in 2008. So to recap, Fiorina is guilty of a major distortion here. Boxer brought up climate change and said it was ""one of the very important national security issues,"" but Fiorina ignores that wording and portrays it as if Boxer cited it as the only priority. In addition, Fiorina casts climate change as something you need to pack an umbrella for, or that prompts you to curse at the TV weatherman -- which strikes us as not only a trivialization of climate change but also a failure to distinguish between two well-established scientific specialties. She also ignores Boxer's lengthy record supporting bills against terrorism",False Pants on Fire,"June 4, 2010"
"""The Interior Department has only 30 days to review an exploration plan submitted by an oil company. That leaves no time for the appropriate environmental review. The result is, they are continually waived.""","As anger grows over the massive, uncontained oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the procedure for issuing federal drilling permits for the Gulf Coast has begun to attract intense scrutiny. During a May 27, 2010, press conference, President Barack Obama -- under pressure for the failure to stem the underwater leak -- laid a large portion of the blame on the existing law that governs the permitting process, as well as the regulations to implement that law, which were drawn up by the Minerals Management Service, the Interior Department office that oversees oil and gas leases.""What's also been made clear from this disaster is that, for years, the oil and gas industry has leveraged such power that they have effectively been allowed to regulate themselves,"" Obama said. ""One example, under current law, the Interior Department has only 30 days to review an exploration plan submitted by an oil company. That leaves no time for the appropriate environmental review. The result is, they are continually waived. And this is just one example of a law that was tailored by the industry to serve their needs instead of the public's. So Congress needs to address these issues as soon as possible, and my administration will work with them to do so.""We wondered whether the president is correct that the law mandates such a short period for an environmental review.The law in question is the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The law was originally passed in 1953, though the amendments relevant to the Obama's statement were added in 1978.Under the law, a proposal to drill must pass through several stages before it can be approved. First, the Interior Department must choose the locations it will open to leasing. Then, the department puts those areas up for lease. Once a lease is purchased by an energy company, the leaseholder must submit an ""exploration plan"" to the Interior Secretary before exercising its right to drill. Interior Department regulations specify that the regional supervisor of MMS has 15 working days after receiving a proposed plan to rule a submission packet complete. At that point, a 30-day clock starts ticking. If the secretary finds problems during this period, modifications can be ordered or, if modifications are insufficient to solve the problem, the lease can be canceled. But if the secretary finds the plan acceptable, it must be approved within that same 30-day window.So Obama is correct about the law's 30-day limit. He's also correct that complete waivers of environmental impact reviews are common. The Interior Department says that in recent years, MMS has granted 250 to 400 waivers annually for Gulf of Mexico projects alone. (The department was unable to provide PolitiFact with the number of cases in which a waiver was not granted.) The Deepwater Horizon project had been given a ""categorical exclusion"" from detailed environmental review more than a year before the disaster occurred -- a decision that is supposed to be granted to projects that are expected to have minimal environmental impact.Meanwhile, on Obama's assertion that 30 days is too short a window to conduct a credible environmental review -- much less a plan to respond to a major malfunction -- many experts we spoke to agreed with the president. In general, then, Obama's statement is on target. But we think it's worth noting that the 30-day limit is not the only factor that explains the failure of MMS to study the environmental impact of Gulf of Mexico projects.The exploration plan Obama referenced is not the only environmental study that is supposed to be conducted during this process. Studies are also required when the lease locations are chosen and when the leases are sold, and they don't have statutory time limits.Critics say that, in their current form, these earlier-stage studies do not include enough detail on the specific drilling locations to qualify as a full-scale environmental assessment. But if MMS -- or Congress, or the industry -- had wanted to beef up these earlier studies as a way of getting around the 30-day limit, they could have done so. But they never did. In their absence, the courts have sometimes stepped in: In 2009, a federal appeals court threw out the initial five-year leasing plan for drilling in Alaska's Chukchi Sea, citing shortcomings in the plan's environmental assessment.Holly Doremus, a law professor at the University of California-Berkeley who has studied the MMS permitting process, called it ""a bit disingenuous"" for Obama to focus solely on the 30-day limit.""The categorical exclusion has never been formally justified by the short time line, and so far as I know MMS has never -- until after this blow-out -- asked Congress for more time to review exploration plans,"" she said in an interview. ""I think rather that MMS has thought, and acted, as if it didn't need to do detailed environmental review at the exploration plan stage"" because it does them at the two earlier stages. ""If that review were more thorough, and considered true worst-case scenarios, it might well be the case that 30 days would be enough to look at the environmental impacts of exploration in a particular location,"" she said.Meanwhile, some say that Congress ought to shoulder a portion of the blame for letting an inadequate permitting process fester for more than 30 years.""If that is too short for a review, then Congress should change it,"" Gary Wolfram, an economics and public policy professor at Hillsdale College. ""My suspicion is that, as with all central planners, Congress doesn’t know the proper amount of time it takes to review a project.'' Belatedly, Congress -- prodded, also belatedly, by the Obama administration -- is looking to change the rules. On May 11, 2010, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar released a legislative package that includes a proposal to eliminate the 30-day deadline. ""Changing this 30-day mandatory deadline to a 90-day timeline that can be further extended to complete environmental and safety reviews, as needed, would provide MMS more time to conduct additional environmental analysis on an exploration plan,"" the department said in its announcement.Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, sought to attach the change to a supplemental spending bill before the congressional Memorial Day recess, but the effort was unsuccessful. Supporters vow to push on. ""I am not aware of any pending free-standing legislation on this, but I do know that Congress will revisit the topic when it gets back,"" said Bill Wicker, a spokesman for Bingaman.Ultimately, Obama was correct on everything he said about the law -- the 30-day limit, the difficulties of conducting a full study in that time frame, and the frequent waivers. But we're marking him down slightly for implying that the 30-day limit tied the administration's hands. If the administration had wanted to change MMS procedures short of rewriting the law, it could have done so by proposing more stringent requirements for the other environmental assessments undertaken during the permitting process, which are not time-limited under the law. And it could have pushed earlier to rewrite the law",Mostly True,"June 1, 2010"
"The federal government only ordered BP to pay ""to do one of those six segments"" of sand barriers for Louisiana.","Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal lamented the federal response to the state's plans to erect sand barriers to keep oil out of marshlands in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster.Jindal talked about a meeting he had had with President Obama where Jindal explained what the state wanted from the feds.""The area we spent the most time was on our plan, the state's plan, to build sand booms to keep this oil out of our wetlands. Now, we have said for weeks now we'd much rather fight this oil on a sandy barrier island than fighting inside our wetlands. We've got miles and miles of these islands that have been eroded by Katrina, by storms, and over time. We proposed a plan, 24 segments, to rebuild, to refortify these islands. After weeks -- and if they'd approved this when we first asked, we could have built 10 miles, 10 miles of sand barriers.""Host Jake Tapper interjected here: ""The president says that more is not always better, and the Army Corps of Engineers took the request seriously, evaluated it, decided it was okay for certain areas, but they didn't necessarily think immediately the plan that was suggested was the right plan. Is that not a fair response?""""Yesterday, the Army Corps of Engineers approved 6 segments out of 24, over 40 miles out of 100,"" Jindal replied. ""But here's where our concern was: The federal government only ordered BP to pay for to do one of those six segments. That's 2 miles out of 100. Our message to the president today was: Make BP pay for this. The federal government shouldn't be making excuses for BP. This is their spill, their oil. They're the responsible party. Make them responsible.""We wanted to check Jindal's claim that the federal government only ordered BP to pay ""to do one of those six segments."" The Obama administration has said over and over that the oil company BP will pay for the clean up, and we wondered how to reconcile that with Jindal's statements.It turns out that Jindal is right about BP paying for one of six segments of sand barriers, but there's more to the story. As Tapper's comment suggested, the feds aren't so keen on the idea of building sand berms. Federal agencies are chiefly concerned that they can't be constructed quickly enough to intercept the oil, and that they will divert money and attention from other efforts.Nevertheless, on Thursday, May 27, 2010, U.S. Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen said the government would give permission for the construction of six barriers and authorize BP to pay for one, as a test to see if the barrier plan is feasible. That one barrier would cost $16 million and be paid for by BP or the federal Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund.""Louisiana's original proposal called for the dredging of more than 92 million cubic yards of material over a six to nine month period to build temporary barrier islands,"" said a statement issued by the Deepwater Horizon Unified Command. The group approved a more limited project because ""implementation of the proposal in all areas approved by the Army Corps of Engineers, in the midst of an active spill, would not be prudent or provide effective protection—especially considering the complications of a major construction project occurring in the midst of a response encompassing more than 20,000 personnel and 1,300 vessels.""The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers listed 33 separate conditions that had to be met, including protections for navigation channels and wildlife.Allen said the approval was meant as a test case. ""There are a lot of doubts whether this is a valid oil spill response technique, given the length of construction and so forth,"" he said. ""But we're not averse to attempting this as a prototype."" Some environmentalists also criticized initial proposals for dredging sand for the barriers too close to shore, according to a report in the Times-Picayune newspaper. After changes were made to address those concerns, the cost estimates for the barriers rose from $250 million to $350 million.The state government could move to build the barriers with state money, but Jindal has rejected that idea without a guarantee of reimbursement.So Jindal is right that the federal government has authorized payment for only one of six barriers. But he leaves out the fact that the government has doubts about the plan and whether it will work or not, and the first barrier is meant as a test case",Mostly True,"June 1, 2010"
Halliburton gave Dick Cheney a $34 million payout when he left the company to join the presidential ticket.,"The oil-services and infrastructure giant Halliburton is a favorite target for critics of former Vice President Dick Cheney, who used to be the company's CEO. During the presidency of George W. Bush, the company's Iraq War-related contracts attracted wide attention. Now, the company's role in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has brought Halliburton back into the headlines.

During a May 20, 2010, appearance with Jay Leno on the Tonight Show, MSNBC host and political commentator Chris Matthews revived the Cheney-Halliburton connection while discussing the spill.

At one point in the interview, Leno said, ""All right, a lot going on in politics with this BP thing. This is the one-month anniversary. Where are we? Who’s the lying scum here?""

Matthews responded, ""Yeah, it’s the scariest thing I’ve ever seen, and, you know, I don’t know where to start. I mean, Halliburton. Sound familiar? Cheney. Cheney was head of Halliburton. When he got to be vice president, when he was signed for vice president, the oil company gave him a $34 million signing bonus to become vice president of the United States.""

We'll grant Matthews some artistic license with his comment. We know he doesn't mean that Cheney literally got a signing bonus for becoming the vice presidential candidate, as a newly signed free agent would in baseball. But we thought it was worth checking whether Cheney did in fact end up with a $34 million payout when he stepped down as CEO to join Bush on the ticket in 2000. We looked at a personal financial disclosure form that Cheney signed on Sept. 1, 2000. This is the filing made once someone joins a national presidential ticket. It represents the candidate's holdings and income as of August. In the portion addressing Cheney's compensation from Halliburtion, the file lists the following categories and dollar amounts as of that date:

• Salary/bonus (gross): $4,721, 947
• Deferred salary: $1,042, 441
• Senior executive deferred compensation contributions: $654,804

Meanwhile, on May 15, 2001, Cheney also signed a second disclosure form that is supposed to update the August 2000 filing so that it covers the full year. In this filing, Cheney disclosed the following Halliburton income:

• Salary/bonus (gross): $821,896
• Elective deferred salary: $403,166
• Stock equivalent unit bonus: $396,213
• Senior executive deferred compensation contributions: $53,692
• Elective deferred salary lump sum payout: $1,140,160
• Restricted stock imputed income: $7,560,000
• Nonqualified stock option income: $21,964,254
• Senior executive deferred compensation payout: $2,797,128

However, we were unclear about whether the totals from the May 2001 filing, which amount to $35.1 million, should be added to those from the August 2000 filing, which amount to $6.4 million, or whether the amounts in the two filings overlap somewhat. Experts we spoke to expressed uncertainty on this question as well. So we decided to take the most cautious approach and only use the numbers from the second filing, which covers the whole year.

That still leaves a total of $35.1 million earned from Halliburtion reported on the May 2001 filing. Of that total, just over $800,000 represents salary and bonus, which Cheney would have earned regardless of whether he joined the ticket or not. Many of the other categories were subject to some calculation and/or negotiation, as would happen in the case of any CEO who left a position early, so it seems fair to call the rest of the income he received an exit package.

So, if you subtract the salary and bonus from the larger amount, voila -- you get $34 million and change. So Matthews is right.

A footnote: Cheney's timing was impeccable. As the disclosure forms indicate, he held a large number of stock options, which means he had been given the right to purchase shares of the company for an old (and, hopefully for the holder of the options) lower price than the current market value. When the holder chooses to exercise those options, they can buy the shares at the low price and then sell them at the market price, pocketing the difference.

It's not clear when Cheney sold his stock options, but it likely was within weeks of his being named to the ticket -- a period when Halliburtion shares hit their 2000 peak, in the low-to-mid $50 range. By November 30, 2000, the stock had fallen to $33 a share. If he'd waited until then to sell, his payday would have been one-third lower, or roughly $14 million rather than $22 million.

But Cheney does appear to have had timing on his side, so we find Matthews' statement -- that Cheney had a payday of $34 million -- to be accurate. If anything, it may have been a bit low",True,"May 24, 2010"
"Louisiana gets ""not one single penny"" from Gulf Coast offshore oil revenues.","In the wake of the BP oil leak disaster, offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico has come under intense scrutiny. On May 11, 2010, as Congress held hearings on the incident, Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La. -- whose state has so far been most directly threatened by the slick -- discussed the issue with MSNBC's Ed Schultz. Landrieu, who has often been an advocate for the energy industry in the Senate, told the liberal talk show host, ""I can promise you, no one's going to let the industry skid. We're going to make BP pay. And, I might say, and you know because you've heard me say this before, when will America realize that the Gulf Coast states need revenue-sharing? Do you know how much money the federal treasury gets from this industry every year? An average of $5 billion. Do you know how much money Louisiana gets? Not one single penny."" Landrieu's statement was so forceful -- that Louisiana gets ""not one single penny"" -- that we thought it deserved a fact-check. Before we get to that question, let's first look to see if she was correct about the federal treasury's take. It turns out that Landrieu is basically right. For 2009, the Minerals Management Service -- the office in the Interior Department that collects revenues from energy production -- sent $5.7 billion directly to the federal treasury. But is the Louisiana share of offshore oil royalties really zero, as Landrieu suggested? It's a bit complicated, but the truth is the state makes millions. Here's the breakdown: • For the first 3 miles out from the shoreline, Louisiana -- like other states -- gets to keep 100 percent of any royalties produced by oil and gas drilling. In the most recent year available, 2008, this amounted to $275 million. • Between 3 and 6 miles from the shoreline -- a federally owned band formally known as the 8(g) area -- the federal government sends 27 percent of the royalties to Louisiana. The reasoning is that federal drilling in this area sucks out some of the oil from deposits that span the 3-mile dividing line between state and federal ownership, so these payments are meant to compensate for the lost revenue to states. In 2009, they totaled $22 million and they're estimated to be $32 million this year. • Beyond 6 miles from the shoreline is considered federal territory. For new drilling projects, states get a 37.5 percent share directly to their treasuries and an additional 12.5 percent for state land and water conservation fund projects. The 37.5 percent figure alone amounted to $6.3 million for Louisiana's treasury in 2009, with additional estimated amounts of $558,000 in 2010 and $476,000 in 2011. Existing drilling projects do not currently provide royalties to the states -- a sore point for Louisianans. (More on that later.) And some bonus money that's an indirect result of oil and gas operations off its shores: Louisiana gets a share of the Coastal Impact Assistance Program, a federal program funded by a one-time appropriation of $1 billion distributed between from 2007 to 2010. This money is dispersed to Gulf Coast states, except for Florida, in an amount roughly proportional to the amount of offshore production in federal waters off their shores. Through this program, Louisiana has taken in a share of the $1 billion appropriation. The grand total that Louisiana receives in a typical year is difficult to compute because of big variations in oil prices and other factors, but we feel safe in saying it's in the tens of millions of dollars every year, and depending on how you slice the numbers, possibly hundreds of millions of dollars. Either way, it's not accurate to say that Louisiana received ""not one single penny,"" as Landrieu did. (We ran our findings by both Landrieu's office and by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and they agreed that our reporting was accurate.) So what's behind Landrieu's claim? She has long argued that the state gets far less than it deserves from the proceeds of offshore drilling. Before passage of the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 -- a bill that Landrieu championed -- Louisiana indeed got no financial benefit from federal wells further than 6 miles from its shores. And even that bill didn't go nearly as far as Landrieu wanted. Because only revenues from new projects are included initially, the payments to Louisiana will be relatively modest through 2017 -- a year outside the ""budget window,"" which is a common trick for lawmakers to make bills seem less expensive than they actually are. After that, the payments get quite large, as royalties from existing projects kick in. Louisiana could reap some of an estimated $385 million in 2017 and a share of up to $630 million in later years. Not seeing those big amounts materialize sooner has been a continued source of irritation for many Louisianans, including Landrieu. Reasonable people can disagree over how much Louisiana deserves to receive from drilling off its shores, but even if Landrieu has a point that her state is getting a raw deal over royalties, it is clearly incorrect for her to say that the state gets ""not one single penny"" from offshore drilling",False,"May 13, 2010"
"Says the EPA ""outsourced the scientific basis for its greenhouse gas regulation to a scandal-plagued international organization that cannot be considered objective or trustworthy.""","Greg Abbott, the Texas attorney general seeking re-election this year, announced a state challenge in February to a judgment that greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide endanger the health of Americans. At a Feb. 16 press conference, Abbott also said the Environmental Protection Agency, which issued the endangerment finding, ""outsourced the scientific basis for its greenhouse gas regulation to a scandal-plagued international organization that cannot be considered objective or trustworthy."" We saw his statement in a press release issued that day by Gov. Rick Perry, who attended the news conference with Abbott. We wondered if Abbott's salvo, echoed at an April forum by a delegate for Perry's campaign, accurately captured the EPA’s approach. Some background: The EPA’s finding, issued in December, came out after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that greenhouse gases are air pollutants covered by the federal Clean Air Act and that the agency must determine whether or not emissions of greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles cause or contribute to air pollution which may endanger public health or welfare. The EPA said its scientific conclusions were based on work by three groups: the U.S. Global Climate Research Program, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the National Research Council, which synthesize thousands of studies, conveying a consensus on what scientific literature shows about climate, according to the agency. ""No other source of information provides such a comprehensive and in-depth analysis across such a large body of scientific studies, adheres to such a high and exacting standard of peer review, and synthesizes the resulting consensus view of a large body of scientific experts across the world,"" the agency said. ""For these reasons, the (EPA) administrator is placing primary and significant weight on these assessment reports in making her decision on endangerment."" The report adds that EPA scientists previously gave ""significant input"" to the groups. The state’s 38-page petition for the EPA to reconsider its finding says that rather than do its own assessment, the agency's ""administrator outsourced the actual scientific study, as well as her required review of the scientific literature necessary to make that assessment."" ""That is, EPA’s conclusion depended on summaries of existing reports that were provided by third parties,"" the petition states, ""rather than on an analysis that was within EPA’s own quality control."" Also, the petition says, the groups that the EPA cites for scientific back-up interweave; two have quoted the third, which is misidentified in Abbott's petition as the United Nations International—it’s actually Intergovernmental—Panel on Climate Change, which we delve into below. First, we tried to ask the EPA about the outsourcing descriptive. Spokeswoman Catherine Milbourn pointed us to an EPA website that calls the science behind greenhouse gas pollution ""settled""; it says too the finding drew upon the works of ""highly respected, peer-reviewed sources"" around the globe plus hundreds of thousands of public comments. So the EPA acknowledges leaning on others' existing research, which it considers tip-top sound. What of the second part of Abbott’s statement--that EPA leaned on a scandal-plagued international organization that cannot be considered objective or trustworthy? He’s referring to the Geneva-based IPCC, which became the leading international body for the assessment of climate change after its formation more than 20 years ago by the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization to ""provide the world with a clear scientific view on the current state of climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic consequences,"" the panel says online. In 2007, the panel shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore, the former vice president with a long interest in global warming. The Norweigan Nobel Committee said the panel created ""an ever-broader informed consensus about the connection between human activities and global warming. Thousands of scientists and officials from over 100 countries have collaborated to achieve greater certainty as to the scale of the warming."" Its 2007 review of research, cited by the EPA, was its latest look at climate science over all. Another is due in 2014. The Fox News Channel has reported that the panel's ""reputation for accuracy and fairness, to a large degree, was responsible for building a consensus around the world that global warming was both real and a potentially devastating phenomenon largely caused by man."" Of late, however, the panel has drawn fire, mainly from skeptics that the planet is rapidly heating. The latest outcry emerged after e-mails surfaced last year involving scientists including researchers at the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom, many of whom have participated in IPCC work. The e-mail back story (detailed by PolitiFact here): On Nov. 20, more than 1,000 e-mails and 3,000 documents came to light. Dating as far back as March 1996, they include exchanges between scientists indicating shaky practices, intentions to withhold public information and even, in one instance, a desire to punch a critic. Over all, though, the Pew Center on Global Climate Change found  the e-mails largely routine and innocuous, writing: ""Although a small percentage of the e-mails are impolite and some express animosity toward opponents, when placed into proper context they do not appear to reveal fraud or other scientific misconduct."" In December, PolitiFact rated False a statement by Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, saying the hacked e-mails debunked the science behind climate change. At a hearing, Inhofe later asked Lisa Jackson, the EPA’s administrator, about the agency leaning on flawed science from the IPCC. Jackson disagreed the panel was discredited, according to video posted online by C-SPAN. ""It’s important to understand that the IPCC is a body, that it follows impartial and open and objective assessments,"" she said. The state's petition for reconsideration mentions the e-mails, noting that Phil Jones, director of the Anglia-based climate research center, was the lead author of the IPCC's 2007 report's ""Summary for Policy Makers,"" and his research is cited 39 times (in 21 chapters) in the panel's report. The petition says the Anglia center is the primary provider of temperature readings used in the IPCC report. So what? So, the state says, the panel's conclusions are flawed because they rely on data from scientists with an agenda, some of them exposed in the e-mails. ""Dr. Jones and his colleagues were far from objective,"" the petition states. ""To the contrary, there is overwhelming evidence of outcome-oriented conduct that severely undermines the objectivity of their scientific research."" The petition specifies scientists whose impartiality the attorney general questions. To plumb Abbott's point, we reviewed news and opinion articles about the panel and its 2007 report shared by his office. Some highlights: The report misstates the year by which Himalayan glaciers are expected to melt (an error, for which the panel offered a correction this year, that looks like a typo); incorrectly overstates how much of Holland rests below sea level; doesn't support an assertion that global warming could soon cut rain-fed north African crop production in half; and includes a statement about rain forests in South America shrinking for lack of rain that might not be proving out. Broadly, critics including some American scientists have called for the panel to open its next report to doubts about the science and to scientists who point out uncertainties. Separately, an arm of the United Nations agreed in February to review the panel; a report is expected in August. Achim Steiner, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme's Governing Council, was quoted in The Telegraph newspaper saying the IPCC faced a crisis of public confidence. Amid the hubbub, there's no sign of nations forsaking the panel. Two leading British and American scientists have been among onlookers to stress that nothing has undermined the panel's 2007 conclusion that human activities are almost certainly contributing to global warming. Robert Watson, environment minister for the British government and a former head of the IPCC, was quoted by The Telegraph saying: ""It is concerning that these mistakes have appeared in the IPCC report, but there is no doubt the earth’s climate is changing and the only way we can explain those changes is primarily human activity."" Ralph Cicerone, president of the National Academies of Science and chairman of the National Research Council, wrote in Science magazine that the exposed e-mails ""raised concern about the standards of science and has damaged public trust in what scientists do."" Yet his ""reading of the vast scientific literature on climate change is that our understanding is undiminished by this incident."" Later, Cicerone was quoted telling scientists they need to redouble their efforts to share the implications of climate change with the public. ""A lot of what we need to do,"" he said, ""is translate basic information into terms the public can understand."" At the same meeting, Jerry North, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, was quoted saying there ""has been no change in the scientific community"" in the consensus that global average temperatures have been steadily climbing since the mid-20th century. John Nielson-Gammon, the Texas state climatologist, recently told us he believes about 95 percent of what the panel concludes. ""It’s probably as good as it gets in terms of a comprehensive analysis done by scientists of a comprehensive... far-reaching issue,"" he said. ""If you're going to rely on something external, that’s the document to rely upon."" Where does all this leave Abbott's statement? True, instead of producing on its own research, the EPA instead relied on the work of three other entities. But calling it ""outsourcing"" is highly misleading because it suggests the agency was shirking its duties. It wasn't. In choosing to use the work of those agencies, particularly the IPCC, the EPA was relying on a large international group of scientists that has reached consensus from thousands of studies. That's a far more comprehensive review than anything the EPA could have done. Abbott also overreaches saying the panel is scandal-plagued and can't be considered objective or trustworthy. Yes, the stolen e-mails have raised questions about a small number of scientists, but the e-mails have not undercut the validity of the panel's main findings. Bottom line: There's a small bit of truth in Abbott's claim, the part that the EPA is relying on outsiders. But his statement is misleading because he implies the EPA has shirked its duties when in fact it is relying on three groups that have synthesized thousands of scientific studies -- almost certainly far more work than the EPA could ever do itself. And yes, the e-mails have raised questions about the work of a clutch of scientists, but they have not put a significant dent in conclusions reached by the IPCC",True,"May 10, 2010"
"""Incoming House Speaker Dean Cannon and incoming Senate President Mike Haridopolos have said they plan to champion efforts next legislative session to allow oil rigs off Florida's coast.""","With a massive offshore oil spill threatening the ecosystems of Florida and other Gulf coast states, a liberal public interest group is attempting to use the environmental disaster in its fight against new drilling near Florida's shores.Progress Florida, a group based in St. Petersburg, is asking leading Florida legislative Republicans to abandon all plans for drilling in state waters, which are 3 to 10 miles off the coast.""Incoming House Speaker Dean Cannon and incoming Senate President Mike Haridopolos have said they plan to champion efforts next legislative session to allow oil rigs off Florida's coast,"" a news release said. The release included an open letter to Cannon and Haridopolos: For the past year, you've relentlessly championed efforts to allow oil rigs as close as three miles from our coast. The human, environmental and economic catastrophe happening now in our Gulf shows the folly of that effort. Although you've expressed new concerns in light of this tragedy, neither of you have publicly abandoned your effort to pass legislation next year that would sell off Florida's coastal waters to British Petroleum, Exxon, Chevron and other oil companies.It's been reported in the media that you want to further study what happened in the Deepwater Horizon accident, as if there is a possible cause that would make drilling in Florida's state waters still Okay? As many experts told you before this massive spill, it's not a matter of ""if"" there will be an oil spill catastrophe, but ""when."" As concerned Floridians, we demand to know, ""YES"" or ""NO"", do you still plan to allow oil drilling off Florida's coast? For this item, we decided to check Progress Florida's claim that Cannon and Haridopolos have said they plan to push drilling legislation when they come to power in the 2011 legislative session. So let's explore where the two incoming leaders stand on drilling.Cannon, R-Winter ParkIn 2009, Cannon filed a bill in the Florida House that would have permitted the state to lease drilling areas (at $1 million per application) that are 3 to 10 miles off Florida's coast. The bill passed the House but failed in the Senate.He brought the bill back in 2010 with provisions that would give the military veto power over drilling leases (it uses the Gulf of Mexico for training exercises) and would prevent, Cannon said, visual impact to Florida's beaches. But without support in the Senate, the bill again died.Before the spill, Cannon said he intended to try a third time in 2011, when he is speaker.On April 17, Cannon stopped the drilling discussion for the year, but said the bill would return. ""What we will do today is leave this issue in the best posture it can be -- in a position that reflects our collective work and our collective concerns,"" Cannon said. ""So when the time is right -- hopefully that is next year -- we take that issue up and deliberate further."" After the spill, however, Cannon called for a timeout.""Until we have all of the facts and all the answers about what happened and why, we shouldn't move forward,"" Cannon said on April 27.And on May 2: ""'I think it definitely is a game changer.""Haridopolos, R-Merrit IslandHaridopolos, the incoming Senate president, also has been a proponent of oil drilling in state waters. ""We will enhance Florida’s economic sovereignty by considering legislation that would allow the state’s Cabinet officials to open the waters off of Florida’s west coast to oil and natural gas production,"" Haridopolos wrote in an editorial published Sept. 24, 2009. ""Florida can no longer afford to sit idly by as competing Gulf Coast states, and even foreign nations, reap the Gulf’s economic benefits. We can’t count on Washington to understand our energy needs, and Floridians need to take steps to reclaim our economic independence.""Haridopolos published a pre-session constituent survey that he said found that 76.7 percent support legislation to allow offshore oil drilling on the Gulf Coast of Florida. The poll was unscientific.Haridopolos also filed legislation in the Senate in 2010 that would have allowed drilling in state waters. The only reason it didn’t move, the St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald reported, was because of opposition from President Jeff Atwater. Like Cannon, Haridopolos has made offshore drilling a priority for Florida's 2011 session, hoping money from oil leases could bring new sources of revenue to Florida.That may not change, even in the wake of the spill.""Anytime you look at any exploration, whether it's energy or space, there are inherent risks,"" Haridopolos said in Florida Today on April 28. ""We just saw 29 miners killed in West Virginia, getting coal.""Next year, we want to know what happened in Louisiana -- was it sabotage, human error, how could it be prevented,"" Haridopolos said. ""This is a big change in policy and something like this gives us pause.""On the same day in the Sarasota Herald-Tribune Haridopolos said: ""One incident should not put the idea to death.""The ruling Florida Progress claims that both have said they plan to bring up oil drilling during the 2011 session, allowing drilling perhaps as close as 3 miles from Florida's shore.

"""Brazil got off oil in the last 30 years.""","A potential ecological disaster in the Gulf of Mexico led to a spirited debate on U.S. energy policy on ABC News' This Week.

Liberal commentator Bill Maher lamented the fact that both major political parties, including President Barack Obama, have supported offshore oil drilling in recent years instead of being more aggressive about renewable energy.

""Where is the other side on this? I could certainly criticize oil companies and I could criticize America in general for not attacking this problem in the '70s. Brazil got off oil in the last 30 years; we certainly could have,"" Maher said.

Maher said Obama seems to be backpedaling on offshore drilling since the spill, adding ""I hope there's a flip-flop I can believe in there.""

Conservative columnist George Will challenged Maher about Brazil. ""Could you just explain to me in what sense has Brazil got off oil?""

""I believe they did,"" Maher said. ""I believe in the 70's they had a program to use sugarcane ethanol, and I believe that is what fuels their country.""

""I think they still burn a lot of oil and have a lot of offshore (drilling),"" Will said.

""Can we have judges factcheck this on Brazil?"" Maher said a few moments later. ""I don't think I dreamed that on Brazil.""

With an invitation like that, how could we resist? So we dug into the research on Brazil and energy.

Brazil does produce a lot of sugarcane ethanol, as Maher said.

""Brazil is one of the largest producers of ethanol in the world and is the largest exporter of the fuel,"" according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, an independent agency within the U.S. Department of Energy that collects and analyzes energy information.

Additionally,  more than half of all cars in Brazil are flexible-fuel capable, which means they can run on 100 percent ethanol or an ethanol-gasoline mixture.

By contrast, the best numbers we found for the United States is that there are approximately 8 million flexible-fuel vehicles, which would translate to roughly 3 percent of all vehicles. (We would caution that even that number might be deceptive, as the U.S. Department of Energy warns that ""many FFV owners don't know their vehicle is one."")

But even though Brazil aggressively uses biofuels, and invests quite a bit in hydroelectric power, it still produces and consumes a lot of oil.

In 2008, Brazil ranked No. 7 on the list of the world's countries that consume the most oil, using about 2.5 million barrels per day. In first place was the United States at 19.5 million barrels per day, followed by China, Japan, India, Russia, and Germany, according to the Energy Information Administration.

Brazil also produces a lot of oil through drilling near its coasts. In recent years, Brazil's state-controlled energy company Petrobras announced a major new find of oil in some of the deepest waters where exploration is conducted, some 7,000 feet below in the Atlantic Ocean. The find is expected to make Brazil even more important in the oil export business. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that Brazil will become a net exporter of oil this year, even before the new fields are tapped.

Getting back to our factcheck, Maher was likely remembering Brazil's aggresive efforts to promote ethanol, and certainly Brazil has outpaced the United States in getting flexible fuel vehicles on the road. But Maher said, ""Brazil got off oil in the last 30 years."" Actually, Brazil still consumes a great deal of oil. It's also embarking on more offshore drilling in some of the deepest waters for exploration. Brazil is hardly ""off oil",False,"May 2, 2010"
"Alaska's Prince William Sound ""is pristine now.""","With 200,000 gallons of oil a day spewing from an exploded oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, forming a slick the size of West Virginia and threatening the coastline of Louisiana, radio pundit Rush Limbaugh said there's no need to panic, that ""the ocean will take care of this on its own if it was left alone and was left out there. It's natural."" And to prove his point, Limbaugh pointed to the restoration of Alaska's Prince William Sound, which was devastated by an oil spill from the Exxon Valdez 21 years ago. ""They were wiping off the rocks with Dawn dishwater detergent and paper towels and so forth,"" Limbaugh said on his April 29, 2010, radio show. ""The place is pristine now."" Government officials involved in the cleanup say the conditions are long way from being pristine, which is defined as ""completely free from dirt or contamination."" Despite the beautiful scenery and wildlife in full view in Prince William Sound, a report from the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council released last year on the 20th anniversary of the spill stated, ""one of the most stunning revelations of Trustee Council-funded monitoring over the last 10 years is that Exxon Valdez oil persists in the environment and in places, is nearly as toxic as it was the first few weeks after the spill."" The Trustee Council, formed by the Alaska government to oversee the restoration of the injured ecosystem, concluded the oil is decreasing at a rate of 0 to 4 percent a year, and ""at this rate, the remaining oil will take decades and possibly centuries to disappear entirely."" We asked Craig Tillery, deputy attorney general for the state of Alaska, about Limbaugh's comment. Tillery, a who has served as counsel to the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council, said it depends on how you define pristine. ""The vast majority of oil that landed in Alaska is gone,"" he said. But the government dug hundreds of test holes and found pockets of ""still fresh-looking oil that is still toxic to the marine environment."" In all, they estimated 23,000 gallons (of the 11 million gallons spilled by the Exxon Valdez) remains in isolated pockets of some beaches. ""It's buried, you wouldn't see it,"" said Tillery. ""It looks pristine, but it's not pristine if your definition is that there's no oil left."" And that oil is still getting into the environment, he said. Sea ducks and sea otters are still exhibiting signs of exposure to oil, he said. And animals such as sea otters, which dig for clams, have released some of the oil trapped under the ground. Most of the wildlife has recovered from the spill, Tillery said, but you also need to consider what you don't see. ""You don't see as many killer whales as you did before the spill,"" he said. ""You don't see herrings in the numbers you did before the spill. On the surface, you'd probably say this looks pretty pristine. Underlying that, though, there is still evidence of the spill."" ""There are beaches where you can turn a shovel and still find oil,"" said Stan Jones, director of external affairs for the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens Advisory Council. Prince William sound has ""mostly recovered visually,"" Jones said, but to call it pristine is an ""overstatement."" Dr. Jeffrey Short, who was the leading chemist for the governments of Alaska and the United States following the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, led a series of studies on the unexpected persistence of the oil. In a Q & A with the environmental group Oceana, with whom he is now employed, Short stated, ""We found that it (oil) lasted a lot longer than we thought in some locations and it was much better preserved than we thought it would be. In some places the oil hadn't degraded much beyond the first couple months after it had spilled."" We asked Short about Limbaugh's comment and he said that while it's fair to say most of Prince William Sound has recovered from the impact of the Exxon Valdez, ""there are some places where the oil continues to linger."" In fact, the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council has a link on its website to its ""Report on Recent Lingering Oil Studies."" ""At the time of the spill, most scientists believed that, within a few years, the process of weathering would either break down and decompose the oil, or would cause it to turn into a form of asphalt that would have little potential to release toxic components into the environment,"" the report states. ""Contrary to these expectations, oil persists at some sites in Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska in a relatively unweathered and potentially toxic condition."" ""Organisms that use the intertidal were severely affected by the spill and continued to show adverse effects from exposure to oil for many years after the spill. These effects manifested themselves in reduced survival rates and diminished populations. In recent years, however, there is evidence of improvement. The extent of oil exposure appears to be diminishing in most species, and there is evidence that the populations of some species are beginning to increase."" That sounds encouraging. But it doesn't change the fact that, despite outward appearance, 21 years after the Exxon Valdez spill, Prince William Sound is not pristine. You may not be able to see it, but scientists and anyone willing to turn over rocks with a shovel attest to the fact that thousands of gallons of oil remain buried in some beaches, and the oil continues to adversely affect the environment",False,"April 30, 2010"
"""The governor switched his position once again on offshore oil drilling.""","Many Republicans believe that Charlie Crist's decision to run for the U.S. Senate as an independent, no-party candidate, helps the Democrats chances in November.But it also means Democrats may have to outmaneuver Crist for some traditional Democratic voters.Leading Democrat U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek started to lay that groundwork within hours of Crist's announcement on April 29, 2010. In an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Meek said Crist's position against offshore oil drilling has vacillated over the years, while Meek's position has never changed.""I've been consistent as relates to being against offshore drilling in Florida,"" Meek said. ""I can't say that (for) every candidate in the race. It was (a) news flash as of two days ago that the governor switched his position once again on offshore oil drilling.""Oil drilling is certainly a timely topic. On March 30, President Barack Obama proposed to open vast expanses of water along the Atlantic coastline, the eastern Gulf of Mexico and the north coast of Alaska to oil and natural gas drilling. Three weeks later, on April 20, an explosion and fire on a drilling rig resulted in a massive oil spill that threatened several Gulf Coast states. The spill has forced many to rethink the benefits of offshore drilling -- including Crist.The key to Meek's claim is how often, and how much, Crist has changed his position.As a candidate for governor in 2006, Crist was unequivocal that he would never support oil drilling off Florida's shores. Crist even evoked childhood memories of cleaning birds after an oil spill in Tampa Bay, the St. Petersburg Times' Steve Bousquet reported. Crist expressed opposition to drilling throughout his career, from state senator to education commissioner to U.S. Senate candidate to attorney general. A sampling: But in 2008, with gasoline prices hovering near $4 a gallon and Crist being mentioned as a possible vice presidential candidate for a ticket that would popularize the phrase ""drill, baby, drill!"", Crist backed off his previous unflinching opposition. On June 18, 2008, Crist said: ""We have to be sympathetic to the pocketbooks of Floridians and what they're paying at the pump for gas and balance that with any way that our state might be able to contribute in terms of resources to have a greater supply and therefore lower prices,"" Crist said. ""I think an open-minded person understands that we ought to at least study (offshore drilling)."" The next week Crist delivered a keynote address at a global climate change summit in Miami. ""We must have an open discussion – without compromising Florida’s sensitive ecosystems and natural beauty,"" Crist said of offshore drilling. ""As I stated last week, only when we are able to do so far enough from Florida’s coast, safe enough for our people and clean enough for our beaches, should we consider increasing our oil supply by drilling off Florida’s shores. Let me repeat that – far enough, safe enough and clean enough.""Crist said options now needed to be studied, but largely stayed away from offering specific proposals.That so-called study period ended with the April 20, 2010 spill.After flying over the gulf and seeing the spill firsthand, Crist withdrew his support for any form of drilling off Florida's coasts.""It could be devastating to Florida if something like that were to occur,"" Crist said. ""It's the last thing in the world I would want to see happen in our beautiful state. Crist also repeated the criteria laid out in his 2008 climate change address, saying the gulf spill proved drilling isn't yet far enough away, clean enough, or safe enough.""Clearly that one isn't far enough and that's about 50 to 60 miles out, it's clearly not clean enough after we saw what we saw today - that's horrific - and it certainly isn't safe enough. It's the opposite of safe,"" Crist said.We should note that Meek has largely opposed increased offshore drilling. Meek was one of 100 U.S. House members in 2003 to sign a letter urging Congressional leaders not to open Florida's coastline to offshore drilling. He signed a similar letter in 2005, and in 2006, voted against a proposal to allow oil and gas exploration within 50 to 100 miles of most coastlines, and within 234 miles of Tampa Bay. He did, however, release a tepid endorsement/criticism (it's hard to tell) of Obama's March 2010 drilling proposal. Read it here.Now back to Meek's claim against Crist. Meek said Crist's positions has changed ""once again"" on offshore drilling. That means at least twice.On a very basic level, Crist was opposed to oil drilling until 2008, then open to it, and now opposed again. That's two changes of positions as Meek suggests. But a more nuanced reading of Crist's statements on offshore drilling produces a slightly different interpretation. Crist was first opposed to oil drilling, then open to it if was proven safe. The April 20, 2010 spill convinced him it wasn't, and as a result, Crist again became opposed.We don't think that's necessarily the same as two flip flops. Crist decided to to explore the possibility of offshore drilling in 2008 after years of rejecting it out of hand (flip 1), but ended that examination after seeing the devastation in the Gulf of Mexico after the April 20 spill. That might be one and a half, but that's not a second flip",Half True,"April 30, 2010"
"""Obama did not open new lands to offshore drilling – all of these areas were already open for drilling once Congress and President Bush lifted the moratorium in 2008. Instead, President Obama yesterday announced what areas he would CLOSE to offshore drilling.""","UPDATE: This item was originally attributed to House Republican Leader John Boehner because we found this news release on his website. But after we published it, Boehner's staff pointed out to us that it actually originated with the Republicans on the House Natural Resources Committee. So we are republishing the item and attributing it to them. Our analysis and ruling has not changed. A few weeks ago, President Barack Obama announced that he's going to open up new areas for offshore drilling.But according to conservative members of Congress, he's actually closing them.Here's such a claim in a news release from the Republicans on the House Natural Resources Committee. ""Obama did not open new lands to offshore drilling – all of these areas were already open for drilling once Congress and President Bush lifted the moratorium in 2008. Instead, President Obama yesterday announced what areas he would CLOSE to offshore drilling.""The claim has been made by other Republicans, including former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin who said at the April 9, 2010, Southern Republican Leadership Conference that, ""after inheriting a good pro-development GOP plan, that opened up both coasts for drilling, the Obama administration halted development."" So yeah, we're confused.Obama's March 31, 2010, announcement about offshore drilling didn't come as too much of a surprise to those who have been following the issue closely. During the campaign, Obama went from being staunchly against the idea of allowing more drilling to saying he would be open to the prospect, a shift for which we gave him a Half Flip. So, when he said on March 31, 2010, that he'd be allowing new drilling, we made the call that he hadn't drifted too much from where he'd ended up at the end of the campaign.Here are the basics of Obama's plan, which lasts from 2012 through 2017: • The coasts of Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and part of Florida's eastern seaboard will be open to ""exploration, study and potential development."" • The northern coast of Alaska in the Chuckchi and Beaufort Seas will also be open to study and potential development. • The Bristol Bay area off of the southern coast of Alaska in the North Aleutian Basin is now protected by a presidential memorandum until 2017. Investigating whether the Republicans are right about Obama's drilling proposal requires a little history.In 1981, Congress authorized an annual offshore drilling moratorium, which was renewed regularly until 2008. Included in that ban were almost all of the Pacific and Atlantic coasts as well as parts of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1990, former President George H.W. Bush imposed an executive moratorium that overlapped with the areas prohibited from drilling under the congressional ban.In 2008, former President George W. Bush lifted his father's ban on drilling. And in the same year, amid high gas prices and election pressures, Democratic leaders allowed the nearly 30-year-old ban on drilling to lapse. Shortly before Bush left office, the Minerals Management Service of the Department of Interior issued a new five-year leasing plan that proposed opening up areas in the Pacific, Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico to new drilling. Also included in the proposal were Bristol Bay as well as the Chuckchi and Beaufort Seas.So, Obama was left with a drilling plan from the former administration, and choices to make as his administration crafted its own energy policy. Under the Bush plan, those areas would have been opened quickly with only a short period of time for citizens, lawmakers and others involved in the process to vet the proposal. So, on Feb. 10, 2009, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar decided to extend the comment period on the new plan for another 180 days. During that time, Salazar held public meetings in the areas that would be impacted by the new drilling. And that brings us to March 31, when Obama announced that he would be allowing new drilling. Looking at his plan -- and the proposal Bush put on the dockets right before he left office -- it's clear that Obama decided to move forward on some parts of the Bush proposal, including drilling in the Atlantic, but scrap other parts, such as drilling in the Northeast and in Bristol Bay.So, generally speaking, the Republicans are correct that the areas where Obama is proposing new drilling were already open when Bush and Congress lifted the bans in 2008. But there is one area that is part of Obama's proposal that was not protected by either ban. It's a swath of ocean in the eastern Gulf of Mexico that is off limits until 2022 as part of the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006. Congress will have to rescind this law in order for drilling to take place there. The Republicans on the committee also said that the only news in Obama's drilling announcement is what areas he plans to close to drilling. Indeed, Bristol Bay has been closed to drilling until 2017 by presidential memorandum. But areas off the coast of California, for instance, have simply not been included in Obama's current drilling plan, which lasts until 2017. So, they're not officially closed, just off the table for now. Republicans also point out that most areas in Obama's plan will be studied for potential drilling first, which could slow the entire process. In theory, some of those areas may never be leased at all, but that remains to be seen.Let's recap: There is some truth to the Republicans' assertion that Obama hasn't opened new areas to drilling given the Bush proposal that was already on the books. But he overlooked the patch of ocean in the eastern gulf that was not part of Bush's plan and is in Obama's proposal. On their second point, the Republicans are also on less than solid ground. Indeed, Bristol Bay -- which likely would have been leased for drilling under the Bush administration -- is closed to drilling, at least until 2017. But other areas not included in Obama's current five-year drilling plan, such as areas in the Pacific, are not technically closed; they're just unavailable for the time being",True,"April 23, 2010"
"People ""can't go fishing anymore because of Obama.""","Since President Barack Obama took office, he's been accused of overturning a number of all-American traditions, including Christmas trees at the White House and gun rights.Now, Obama apparently wants to ban a popular American pastime: fishing.On his March 9, 2010, talk show, Rush Limbaugh claimed that, ""fishing is on the verge becoming a privilege controlled by Barack Obama."" He went on to say that he's only had a few experiences with the sport, but that, ""I know a lot of people, former professional athletes, who go into shock after hearing they can't go fishing anymore because of Obama.""Like so many claims we check at PolitiFact, this one was messy. It started, of all places, with a story from ESPNOutdoors.com, was picked up by conservative bloggers, and then made its way to Limbaugh's radio show and other outlets including Glenn Beck's evening program on Fox News. In the process, the story changed.So, we'll do our best to sort through the rhetorical rubble.To support his claim, Limbaugh points to an article that appeared on ESPNOutdoors.com on March 9, 2010. The article, written by Robert Montgomery, reported that, ""The Obama administration will accept no more public input for a federal strategy that could prohibit U.S. citizens from fishing the nation's oceans, coastal areas, Great Lakes, and even inland waters."" This quote was pulled from the Web site of left-wing media watchdog Media Matters. Montgomery later changed his column, so the original language is no longer on the ESPNOutdoors site. But more about that later.Montgomery was writing about Obama's Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force, a 24-member group headed by the chair of Obama's Council on Environmental Quality. In June 2009, Obama created the task force to develop a national policy to protect, maintain and restore oceans, coasts and the Great Lakes. He asked the group recommend a framework for improved stewardship and effective coastal and marine spatial planning; the group released a draft of its recommendations in December 2009. Among other things, it recommends creating nine regional planning areas to carry out the framework. In plain English, the Obama administration is drafting new plans for waterway conservation. ""Spatial planning"" is jargon for making sure that waterways are being used in the most economically and environmentally friendly way, explained Beth Lowell, federal policy director for ocean conservation group Oceana. If a body of water has no biological value, perhaps it's best used for a wind farm, she gave as an example. Or if there's a vulnerable coral reef in the area, the framework will help sort out what kinds of fishing can be done on the surface so as not to disturb the ecosystem below.So, the framework may mean changes in fishing practices in some areas, depending on the location, the local economy and specific ecological problems. Indeed, the draft framework states that plans ""are expected to vary from region to region according to the specific needs, capacity, and issues particular to each region."" Almost instantaneously, conservative bloggers picked up on Montgomery's story. Michelle Malkin wrote, ""Sacrificing jobs for the green agenda. Conducting Kabuki theater on public input. Business as usual for the Obama White House.""And from Gateway Pundit: ""Obama’s latest assault on your rights– He wants to ban sport fishing. Barack Obama has a message for America’s 60,000,000 anglers – We don't need you."" The meme found its way to the desks of Limbaugh and of Beck, who implied on his March 10, 2010, show that Obama was banning fishing by executive order.""Obama will no longer listen to the public as he tries to prohibit U.S. citizens from fishing on some of the nation's oceans, coastal areas and Great Lakes and even some inland waters,"" he said. ""No more fishing. . . . Some environmentalists want to save the fish. Forget about the frickin' fish! People are losing their rights.""(We should point out that Obama has not banned fishing through executive order, so Beck is wrong on that point.)The firestorm prompted ESPNOutdoors executive editor Steve Bowman to issue a statement on the story. He wrote that the news organization should have made it clear that the story was an opinion column in a series of stories on the implications of Obama's new task force. ""While our series overall has examined several sides of the topic, this particular column was not properly balanced and failed to represent contrary points of view,"" Bowman wrote. ""We have reached out to people on every side of the issue and reported their points of view -- if they chose to respond -- throughout the series, but failed to do so in this specific column.""Media Matters also noted that the first paragraph of Montgomery's story now reads that the administration's plan ""could prohibit U.S. citizens from fishing some of the nation's oceans, coastal areas, Great Lakes, and even inland waters."" (The emphasis is ours to show the difference between Montgomery's first and second iteration of the column.)The column still fails to mention that the administration has made no final decisions on the recommendations. And while the framework could change some fishing practices as Lowell points out, the draft proposals do not say anything about banning recreational fishing as the column implies. Here's what Christine Glunz, spokeswoman for the White House Council on Environmental Quality, had to say about the issue: ""The draft reports issued by the Ocean Policy Task Force have involved extensive stakeholder input and public participation as they were being prepared, which has included the interests of conservationists and the recreational fishing community. These draft reports are not map-drawing exercises, they do not contain a zoning plan, and they do not establish any restrictions on recreational fishing or on public access, nor make any judgments about whether one ocean activity or use is better than another.''And Eric Schwaab, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's assistant administrator for fisheries, simply stated in a March 10, 2010, statement that ""the Ocean Policy Task Force has not recommended a ban on recreational fishing."" Like many things we check at PolitiFact, this claim is like sausage: It went in the meat processor that is the Internet as one thing and came out quite different. An opinion piece that argued Obama's effort could ban some fishing was chopped up, reprocessed and put back together as a claim that Obama wants to ban all fishing. In fact, the draft framework says nothing about banning fishing. Limbaugh has taken an early discussion about the use of waterways and twisted it to make it sound like Obama is outlawing a popular pastime. While the panel's recommendation could change fishing practices in some areas, the framework is still in draft form; the administration has not made any final decisions on what the framework will look like. But Limbaugh is grossly distorting the truth",False Pants on Fire,"March 17, 2010"
"""Mayor White has major stake in Barnett Shale production company.""","
Gubernatorial hopeful Bill White doesn’t shy away from energy issues — after all, he was mayor of Houston, a city that many oil and gas companies call home, and was deputy energy secretary for about two years during the Clinton administration.

More unusual by Houston — and Texas — standards, White touts initiatives undertaken during his six years as mayor to reduce the amount of toxic chemicals emitted by Houston's petrochemical industries.

But now Farouk Shami, White's leading Democratic opponent, is trying to use an energy issue against the former mayor, touching on concerns among residents and officials about the environmental and health effects of drilling in populated areas of the Barnett Shale, a natural gas field that stretches west and south from Dallas and covers more than 20 counties.

Shami released a statement Feb. 9 with this headline: ""Mayor White Has Major Stake in Barnett Shale Production Company."" In it, Shami concluded that ""it's a conflict of interest at best and utter hypocrisy at worst.""

First things first. Is White really connected to a company drilling for natural gas in the Barnett Shale?

Shami’s statement links White to the drilling through the former mayor’s ownership of stock in Exxon Mobil Corp., based in Irving. The oil giant is in the process of buying Fort Worth-based XTO Energy Inc., one of the leading producers of gas in the Barnett Shale. XTO says on its Web site that the area accounts for more than 20 percent of its total oil and natural gas production, and it has plans to expand its drilling there.

Shami's press release says White ""has at least $2.2 million invested in oil and gas stocks, with a substantial position in the giant Exxon Mobile"" (sic).

Asked how it calculated the size of White's investment, Shami's campaign provided a chart based on a federal financial disclosure form White filed in May 2009 when he was a candidate for the U.S. Senate. The campaign counted 14 energy companies in White’s portfolio during 2008, including Exxon and ConocoPhillips. Then it added up the reported values of White’s energy stock holdings.
 
Therein lies a problem. Instead of exact dollar amounts, the disclosure form lists a range of values for each stock, and some are pretty wide. For example, the reported value of White’s investment in BJ Services Co., an oil and gas services company on whose board he sits, is between $500,001 and $1 million – a difference of a half-million dollars. Totaling the high numbers yields $2.2 million; using the low numbers, $1 million.
 
In text with the chart, the Shami campaign used different language from the press release, which states that White has ""at least $2.2 million"" invested in oil and gas companies. The chart wording states White has ""as much as"" that amount.

A more definitive measure of White's holdings came from his campaign, which said his oil and gas stocks were worth $1.1 million to $1.3 million in 2009. They are in several accounts personally managed by White and account for about 25 percent of his total portfolio.

The White campaign said the candidate has owned Exxon stock for more than five years and disclosed to us the number (700) and value (about $45,000) of the shares. Since Exxon is valued at about $310 billion, White owns far less than 1 percent — a figure that Katy Bacon, a spokeswoman for the White campaign, suggested does not constitute the ""substantial position"" in Exxon that Shami claims.

Besides, Exxon’s $31 billion purchase of XTO, announced in December, is still pending, subject to approval by XTO stockholders and the Federal Trade Commission. That means that as of right now, owning stock in Exxon does not equal owning stock in XTO.
 
However, we discovered White does have an interest in Barnett Shale drilling through another company in his portfolio. According to the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, ConocoPhillips — in which White reported owning stock valued between $100,001 and $250,000 in 2008 — is currently active in the Barnett Shale through a subsidiary, Burlington Resources.

So much for assessing White's stake in the Barnett Shale. A more problematic issue is whether the investments constitute a conflict of interest, as Shami claims.

During the debate, both Shami and a reporter asked White whether he supported a proposed moratorium on new drilling in the Barnett Shale. White said he did not, arguing that emissions and other violations should be addressed on a case-by-case basis. ""I think it would be unfair to shut down operations of all operators based on what some operators do,"" he said.

In the news release, Shami, who is in favor of a moratorium, says that ""it’s disturbing to think Mayor White’s conflict of interest could be putting people’s lives at risk.""

Brian Roberts, a professor of government at the University of Texas, said the ethical concerns raised by Shami are speculative and could become an issue only if White, as governor, were to participate in decisions related to oil and gas. But Roberts said the regulation of those industries largely belongs to the Railroad Commission, whose members are elected.

Putting aside the conflict issue, where does this leave us?

Shami is correct that White has a financial interest in Exxon, as well as other oil and gas companies. And it's true that Exxon is acquiring XTO, a $27 billion company that's a big player in the Barnett Shale. But Shami's assertion that White's $45,000 investment in Exxon constitutes a ""major stake"" in XTO is off the mark.

Though we found that White has a larger interest in ConocoPhillips, which owns another company drilling in the Barnett Shale, that too is a tiny piece of a multinational oil company's action",True,"February 22, 2010"
"Houston is ""the third-most toxic city in the United States of America.""","
Houston businessman Farouk Shami, running for governor, turned to his leading Democratic foe on Monday night and leveled a foul charge.

In a televised debate, Shami told Bill White, the former Houston mayor: ""Our city is the third-most toxic city in the United States of America.""

White didn’t take issue with Shami’s description, but it was news to us. We decided to check into the Bayou City’s ""ick"" ranking.

Shami’s campaign said the candidate based his statement on a 2009 article in Forbes magazine putting Houston behind only Atlanta and Detroit for toxicity among major U.S. cities.

The magazine said it based its rankings of the nation’s 40 largest metropolitan statistical areas on data provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

""We counted the number of facilities that reported releasing toxins into the environment,"" the magazine said, ""the total pounds of certain toxic chemicals released into the air, water and earth, the days per year that air pollution was above healthy levels, and the number of times the EPA has responded to reports of a potentially hazardous environmental incident or site in each metro area's principal city.""

Its article states Houston's residents live with with air that's far filthier than it should be.

""Facilities in Houston released 88.7 million pounds of toxic chemicals in the environment in 2007,"" the magazine says, ""and the former site of a methanol fire and chemical explosion number among the city's 50 sites necessitating an EPA response. Factories that serve the local petrochemical industry emit benzene and 1-3 butabeine, toxins proven to be particularly harmful, that the area's intense sunlight and lack of wind keep trapped in the local area's atmosphere.""

Jim Lester, vice president of the Houston Advanced Research Center, a Woodlands-based nonprofit group that studies and promotes sustainable development, is quoted saying Houston has become ""one of the favorite places in the world for doing air-quality science."" He saw that as a boon: ""The more people understand about it (air quality), the more changes are likely that will take us in a positive direction.""

When we reached Lester, he revisited pollution levels reported by industries and posted online by the EPA. In 2007, Harris County industries reported either releasing or disposing of 36.1 million pounds of toxic chemicals, while industries around Detroit in Wayne County nearly matched that dubious achievement, reporting the disposal or release of nearly 30 million pounds of toxic pollutants.

Shami correctly referred to a recent national comparison",True,"February 9, 2010"
"The Climatic Research Unit e-mails show that the science behind climate change ""has been pretty well debunked.""","The newest tool in climate skeptics' arsenal: a series of  hacked e-mails  from the Climatic Research Unit, a branch of the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom.

The correspondence, which was stolen from CRU's server sometime around Nov. 20, has some saying that the scientific underpinnings of climate change are false.

When asked on Dec. 7, 2009, about the Environmental Protection Agency's recent announcement that it will now consider carbon dioxide a pollutant, a move that clears the way for stricter regulations of the greenhouse gas, longtime climate change critic Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., had this to say on CNN's  The Situation Room  :

""We see that that science [behind the announcement] has been pretty well debunked,"" he said referring to the e-mails. ""I remember a long time ago ... I made a speech on the Senate floor where I talked about all these scientists coming in, talking about how they can't get their side on there and the science is all rigged. ... Sure enough, what is happening today in this whole debate is just what we said was happening four years ago.""

Specifically, Inhofe was talking about data that the EPA used to form its decision. It came from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a scientific body that ""reviews and assesses the most recent scientific, technical and socioeconomic information produced worldwide relevant to the understanding of climate change."" Thousands of scientists contribute data to the organization voluntarily, including scientists at CRU, the group whose e-mails were hacked.

We've been following the complicated e-mail controversy for weeks, but there have been a number of issues that make fact-checking claims about the issue difficult. To start, the e-mails were obtained illegally, which raises questions about their validity. Some e-mails simply demonstrate a professional rivalry between scientists, a phenomenon that's nothing new to the profession. Scientists are disputing the meaning of some of the language in the e-mails. Finally, CRU has announced that it is conducting its own investigation into whether data were tossed out or otherwise manipulated unethically; that investigation is not complete.

We do know that these e-mails clearly demonstrate some petty professional backstabbing and a degree of skepticism within the CRU circle about opinions that do not match their own.  Read our story on the e-mail controversy  .

We also know this: The e-mails do not prove that climate change is a hoax.

Here's why: Independent of CRU's data, agencies and academics all over the world are coming to essentially the same conclusion: Climate change is happening.

Just take a recent report issued by the  United States Global Research Program  , an arm of the government that, since 1989, has been coordinating and integrating federal research on changes in the global environment and their implications for society. The report states that ""global warming is unequivocal and primarily human-induced. ... Warming over this century is projected to be considerably greater than over the last century. The global average temperature since 1900 has risen by about 1.5ºF. By 2100, it is projected to rise another 2 to 11.5ºF.""

There are other ways to quantify these changes. NASA, for instance, tracks data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado at Boulder to see how temperatures are affecting the arctic. The most recent data show that 2009 marks the third-lowest Arctic sea ice minimum on record.

Similarly, data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration show that sea levels over the past 100 years are rising at an average rate of 1.7 millimeters annually, ""which is significantly larger than the rate averaged over the last several thousand years. Since 1993, global sea level has risen at an accelerating rate of around 3.5 mm/year. Much of the sea level rise to date is a result of increasing heat of the ocean causing it to expand.""

And here's an important point on NOAA's Web site:

""A number of agencies around the world have produced datasets of global-scale changes in surface temperature using different techniques to process the data and remove measurement errors that could lead to false interpretations of temperature trends,"" the Web site says. ""The warming trend that is apparent in all of the independent methods of calculating global temperature change is also confirmed by other independent observations, such as the melting of mountain glaciers on every continent, reductions in the extent of snow cover, earlier blooming of plants in spring, a shorter ice season on lakes and rivers, ocean heat content, reduced arctic sea ice, and rising sea levels.""

In short, temperatures are rising.

So, to say that the CRU e-mails debunk the science supporting climate change leaves out the important point that CRU isn't the only organization looking at the issue. Indeed, there are reams of data that show temperatures are increasing and that greater concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are largely to blame",False,"December 11, 2009"
"""President Obama's proposal calls for serious cuts in our own long-term carbon emissions,"" but China and India will still be allowed to increase their emissions.","On Day 2 of the climate talks in Copenhagen, Denmark, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin decided to weigh in.

Her op-ed, published in the Dec. 9, 2009, edition of the  Washington Post  , enumerated her concerns about a series of e-mails that skeptics say show disagreement over the seriousness of climate change and President Barack Obama's plan to pledge to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent below 2005 levels. We wrote  a separate story on the e-mails  . Here, we'll look at the emissions questions.

Palin argues that developing countries, like India and China, should at least be equal partners in the effort to slow global warming; it's unfair for the United States to shoulder the burden. ""Unlike the proposals China and India offered prior to Copenhagen -- which actually allow them to increase their emissions -- President Obama's proposal calls for serious cuts in our own long-term carbon emissions,"" she wrote.

Is that really what is happening? On Nov. 27, 2009, China announced it will lower emissions 40 to 45 percent below 2005 levels by 2020.

That may sound like a lot, but it's important to read the fine print here. China is talking about lowering carbon intensity. It's a measurement of how much energy it takes to produce a given amount of economic output. Climate experts say this means emissions from China will likely continue to grow along with its economy, but not as quickly as they would have otherwise.

""Let's say you commit to an intensity target of -6% per year in carbon/GDP,"" wrote climate scientist Jonathan Koomey, professor at Yale University’s School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. ""If your GDP grows at 10% per year, that means your carbon emissions will still grow 4% per year. So you're improving your carbon efficiency but absolute emissions are still increasing.""

Indeed, China's GDP is growing rapidly. In the third quarter of this year, it grew 8.9 percent, likely bringing the total annual growth to 8 percent.

On Dec. 4, India offered a similar proposal. Officials there say the country is prepared to cut carbon intensity from 20 to 25 percent by 2020. It's a landmark announcement for India; traditionally, the country has argued that it cannot afford to curb greenhouse gas emissions. But like China, India's economy is growing rapidly, and with it its carbon emissions.

Obama, on the other hand, is arguing for a cut large enough that the United States would see an absolute reduction in emissions, explained Koomey. (Obama's plan to trim emissions by 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 is part of a cap-and-trade change bill pending in the House of Representatives. A Senate bill would require a 20 percent cut.) Koomey, like many climate scientists, say overall cuts -- even from developing countries -- are necessary to really slow down climate change. While the United States' proposed cuts are more stringent than those proposed by China or India, they're less aggressive than the 25 to 50 percent emissions reduction scientists say countries must adopt to hold global average temperature increases to about 2 degrees Celsius.

So, where does that leave Palin's claim? She's correct that China and India's plans will allow them to increase emissions, while the United States would have to cut back",True,"December 11, 2009"
"The ""post-Soviet industrial meltdown is responsible for most of the progress in reducing carbon emissions that Europe is able to claim.""","This week, world leaders are meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark, to try to hammer out a global climate accord.
 
Washington Post  columnist Eugene Robinson had this to say about the upcoming summit in his Dec. 1, 2009, column:
 
""When the Copenhagen climate summit convenes next week, the European nations that have led the crusade against global warming will be able to report that the continent has met the targets for carbon-emission reductions set in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. There may be shoulder dislocations from all the self-congratulatory back-patting,"" Robinson wrote. ""But the Kyoto targets were well on the way toward being met before they were even established. The targets are based on 1990 emissions levels -- after the Soviet Union and the East Bloc had been fouling the air for years with their antiquated, carbon-spewing heavy industries. When the communist regimes -- and their creaky economies -- collapsed in a heap, emissions from the former Soviet-dominated zone fell by nearly 40 percent. ... This post-Soviet industrial meltdown is responsible for most of the progress in reducing carbon emissions that Europe is able to claim.""
 
Like Robinson, we expect the next 10 days to be full of complicated discussion about carbon emissions and reductions -- and a lot of boasting by the United States, Europe and other countries about all they're doing to slow climate change. So his claim about emissions reductions in former Soviet territory intrigued us.
 
But before we dig into this statement, a little background on the meeting in Copenhagen will be useful. It's arguably the most important climate gathering since 1997, when participating countries adopted the Kyoto Protocol in Kyoto, Japan. Collectively, 38 industrialized countries -- otherwise known as Annex B countries -- committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 5 percent below 1990 levels. At the time, 15 of those countries were members of the nascent European Union. The rest included Canada, Australia, and a handful of Eastern European countries recently liberated from the former Soviet Union; the protocol refers to these nations as ""economies in transition.""
 
The United States never ratified the treaty. In fact, according to data from the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Web site -- an international treaty written in 1992 meant to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations  -- our emissions have increased 17 percent over 1990 levels.
 
The protocol went into force in 2005, and it expires in 2012. So, world leaders are gathering in Copenhagen with the hope of laying the groundwork for the next round of emissions reductions. However, it's unclear what will actually be accomplished at the meeting. Congress has been  slow to act  on a  cap-and-trade bill  , which was initially considered the United States' strongest bargaining chip. And negotiations haven't been helped by news of hacked e-mails between climate scientists at Climate Research Unit that skeptics say  show disagreement  on the seriousness of global warming.
 
Historical data from the UNFCCC show that greenhouse gas emissions in Eastern Europe dropped dramatically after the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991. For example, Ukraine's annual carbon dioxide emissions dropped from 715 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 1990 to 426 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 1994.
 
All the experts we spoke with agreed this drop was due to the collapse of the Soviet Union. They also told us that a specific drop of ""nearly 40 percent"" was also in the ballpark. We asked Robinson, and he pointed us to  this post  on the Green Grok, a respected blog about environmental issues maintained by the Nicholas School of the Environment at Duke University, that includes a chart of emissions reductions derived from the most recent UNFCCC data. Indeed, in 2007, emissions from eastern European countries were still about 37 percent below 1990 levels, according to the blog.
 
They agreed that Robinson's second point -- that the ""post-Soviet industrial meltdown is responsible for most of the progress in reducing carbon emissions that Europe is able to claim"" -- has some truth to it. But they also told us that the story is more complicated than Robinson makes it seem.
 
Emissions in Europe have fallen for several reasons, said Michael Levi, director of the program on energy security and climate change for the Council on Foreign Relations. For example, during the 1990s, the United Kingdom switched from coal energy to natural gas, which helped trim emissions. And Europe's population has remained relatively flat.
 
But more importantly, Europe has had some pretty serious policies in place to reduce emissions, Levi said, including a carbon trading plan and incentives for alternative energy production.
 
""Overall, [Robinson's] point is correct, but it's overstated,"" he said.
 
Prasad Kasibhatla, associate professor at Nicholas School, agreed.

""The essence of the claim by Eugene Robinson is indeed correct,"" he wrote us in an e-mail. ""According to the latest year of reporting (2007), emission reductions in the EU-15 were driven largely by large reductions in Germany and the U.K. Part of the large reductions in Germany were driven by reunification with East Germany and part of the large reductions in the U.K. were driven by switch from coal to natural gas due to reforms of energy markets.""

Those variables paired with new climate change policies have reduced emissions in Western European countries by 4 percent, according to UNFCCC data.

In an e-mail, Robinson agreed that he may have glossed over that point.

""The EU countries did reduce emissions by 4 percent; I gave them credit for holding emissions down but perhaps not enough credit for the actual reduction.""

We also think it may have been more accurate for Robinson to clarify that the ""Europeans"" included the transitioning economies from the former Soviet bloc.

But Robinson argued that his overall point stands.

""The point I was trying to make, and I still believe it's valid, is that the Soviet bloc collapse created a huge, one-time fall-off in emissions that makes the numbers look better than they otherwise would against the Kyoto targets,"" he wrote.

With that point, we concur. Our experts tell us that it's widely understood that the fall of the Soviet Union meant major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. But they also said that Robinson glosses over important points in his statement, including that many European Union countries have taken key steps to slow climate change",Mostly True,"December 9, 2009"
"""The Congressional Budget Office -- supposedly non-partisan -- estimates that in just a few years the average cost to every family of four (from cap and trade) will be $6,800 per year.""","Critics of the Democratic cap-and-trade proposal have many complaints about the plan, but their biggest is cost. They say it will cost so much that it will be a significant burden on a typical American family.

The latest variation of this comes in a chain e-mail that contends the cap-and-trade plan will require more energy-efficient homes (a claim we rated  Pants on Fire  ). The e-mail says, ""The Congressional Budget Office -- supposedly non-partisan -- estimates that in just a few years the average cost to every family of four will be $6,800 per year. No one is excluded.""

We've spent a lot of time  looking into claims  about how much the cap-and-trade plan could cost families, and one thing's for certain: There's no consensus. The Environmental Protection Agency says it could cost as little as $80 per year while the conservative Heritage Foundation says it could cost as much as $1,241 annually in higher energy bills.

We've explained the pros and cons of the various estimates in those previous items, so here we're going to look into the chain e-mail's claim that the CBO estimates cap-and-trade will cost a family of four $6,800 a year.

The bill in question is called the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009. It is sponsored by Henry Waxman of California and Edward Markey of Massachusetts, and aims to reduce carbon emissions 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Companies, particularly utilities, would have to either buy pollution credits or adopt cleaner technology.

Critics say that either way, the cost of energy will go up, and that cost will be passed on to the consumer.

The CBO is a key player because it is a widely respected nonpartisan branch of Congress that calculates cost estimates. In June 2009, the CBO released an analysis of the House bill, saying that the economywide cost of the cap-and-trade program in 2020 would be $22 billion -- or about $175 per household. The individual cost would vary depending on your wealth. Low-income consumers could expect to save $40 a year because of credits from utilities, while high-income consumers would see a net cost for energy of $235 to $340 annually. It's also important to note that the costs are expected to vary year to year because of the way the law would be phased in. The CBO chose 2020 as a milestone for its analysis because it's a point at which the program would have been in effect for eight years, giving the economy and polluters time to adjust. But had the CBO chosen a later date, the cost per family may have been higher because the government would gradually be charging polluters more.

We traced the $6,800 estimate back to a report from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that has been very critical of the cap-and-trade plan. In the report, the group criticizes the CBO for failing to consider the harm that the cap-and-trade plan could do to the economy. The conservative group says the law could cause companies to produce less, which would reduce the GDP in 2020 by $161 billion in 2009 dollars. By 2035, it would be $650 billion lower, which works out to about $6,800 per family of four per year.

So the chain e-mail has taken the estimate from a conservative think tank and falsely attributed it to the CBO, a nonpartisan branch of Congress. There are many legitimate questions that can be raised about the cost of cap-and-trade, but it's simply incorrect to say the CBO came up with the $6,800 figure",False,"November 27, 2009"
"Under the cap-and-trade bill, homes would have to be retrofitted to meet energy and water efficiency standards before they could be sold.","
Here's one way to get our attention.

 

Send us a chain e-mail with this subject line: ""We don't make this up.""

 

The e-mail, which we have received in several forms over the past few months, has to do with a cap-and-trade bill making its way through Congress and how it would treat energy efficiency in existing homes.  

 

According to the e-mail, ""Beginning 1 year after enactment of the Cap and Trade Act, you won't be able to sell your home unless you retrofit it to comply with the energy and water efficiency standards of this Act. H.R. 2454, the 'Cap & Trade' bill passed by the House of Representatives.""

 

""A year from now you won't be able to sell your house,"" the e-mail goes on. ""Yes, you read that right. The caveat is (there always is a caveat) that if you have enough money to make required major upgrades to your home, then you can sell it. But, if not, then forget it.""

 

Home sellers will require a government license to put their home on the market, according to the letter.

 

The claim has gone viral on the Internet, and versions of it have been repeated by Republican lawmakers, including

House Republican Leader John Boehner

. Our friends over at FactCheck.org

looked into

Boehner's claim over the summer and found it to be false.

 

We've explored many aspects of the bill, including

how much it would cost

and whether it would

create or cut jobs

. So here we will examine what the bill says about making existing homes more energy efficient.

 

Here's how cap-and-trade would work. Under House legislation, the target of the chain e-mail's criticism, the government would be required to set an overall cap on carbon emissions in an effort to slow climate change. More specifically, the bill aims to lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Companies would either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits -- also known as allowances -- to continue polluting. Initially, most allowances would be given out free. But eventually companies would have to buy those permits from the government.

 

There's lots of language in the bill regarding building efficiency.

 

Section 201, for instance, requires building energy codes for new homes to be 30 percent more efficient than current standards when the bill goes into law and 50 percent more efficient by 2016. States and local governments will be responsible for enforcing the new codes, but will receive government allowances to cover the cost of developing and adopting the improvements. And Section 202 of the bill would establish a program that would allow states to help homeowners finance energy-efficient home retrofits; the more energy a retrofit saves, the more money the homeowner would get from the government to subsidize the work.

 

Finally, Section 204 would require the Environmental Protection Agency to develop a model program that states could voluntarily adopt to label new buildings for their energy performance. This ""license,"" as the chain e-mail calls it, is only applicable to new construction and would be completely voluntary.

 

In fact, that's a point the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the panel that has jurisdiction over the cap-and-trade bill, makes over and over in its summary of the legislation: ""Nothing would require a homeowner to audit or retrofit their home to ensure that it meets building code requirements,"" the document says.

 

Lane Burt, a building efficiency expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, who has blogged about the issue, says the e-mail is false.

 

""The anti-efficiency crowd have alleged that the [cap-and-trade] bill is going to require Americans trying to sell their homes to undergo some sort of energy inspection or meet some sort of green requirements -- 'or else,' "" he wrote of the supposed requirement in the bill. ""Of course, when I have heard and read this claim there isn't a provision cited, and for good reason -- it doesn't exist!""

 

William Fay, executive director of the Building Energy Efficient Codes Network -- a coalition including The Alliance to Save Energy, Duke Energy Corp. and the National Association of State Energy Officials among other organizations -- called the e-mail an ""urban myth.""

 

""The bill certainly does not require a retrofit, or an energy label for an existing home,"" Fay said. ""It does not make them a condition of sale.""

 

This fact-check is clear-cut. There's nothing in the bill that would require homeowners to retrofit their homes to meet new efficiency standards or get a government ""license"" before putting their home on the market. Homeowners who do want to retrofit their homes can do so voluntarily and with the help of government funding",False Pants on Fire,"November 23, 2009"
"Obama has admitted a cap and trade plan would cause electricity bills to ""skyrocket.""","In her new book,  Going Rogue  , Sarah Palin said President Barack Obama's support for a cap and trade plan was ""misguided."" ""The president has already admitted that the policy he seeks will cause our electricity bills to 'skyrocket.' Sadly, those hit hardest will be those who are already struggling to make ends meet,"" she wrote. Here, we're looking at Obama's comments on electricity bills. First, though, here's a quick summary of cap and trade for those who aren't famliar with it: To slow climate change, the government would set a cap on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. To comply, companies such as electric utilities must either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits — also known as allowances — to continue polluting. Companies can buy and sell the credits as necessary to conduct their business. We were familiar with Obama's original quote from his campaign for president. It came from a videotaped interview he did with the  San Francisco Chronicle  editorial board very early in the campaign in January 2008.

""Under my plan of a cap-and-trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket,"" Obama told the  Chronicle  . ""Coal-powered plants, you know, natural gas, you name it, whatever the plants were, whatever the industry was, they would have to retrofit their operations. That will cost money. They will pass that money on to consumers.""

Obama also said the biggest challenge would be making sure voters understand why such a plan is necessary. ""The problem is, can you get the American people to say this is really important,"" Obama said. Obama was talking in general about cap and trade, but there is now a specific bill making its way through Congress, written by Reps. Henry Waxman and Edward Markey, Democrats from California and Massachusetts, respectively. Their goal is to lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Under their plan, most pollution permits initially would be given out for free. But eventually, companies would have to buy those permits from the government.  The latest version of the bill includes a number of measures to offset higher utility bills for consumers. Revenue from the permits would be passed to consumers through rebates or expanded efficiency programs, and an additional 15 percent of the revenue would go directly to low-income consumers. Legislators have opted to give 85 percent of the polluting permits away for free instead of putting them up for sale, as Obama pledged to do on the campaign trail. In theory, this approach should reduce costs to consumers. So how much would rates go up for consumers? It's hard to say. There has been much debate about the costs, and it's been difficult to come up with a reliable number because the bills have been changing as they move through the House and the Senate",False Pants on Fire,"November 16, 2009"
"""For the last decade the climate has been cooling.""","Skeptics of climate change often say the world has been cooling in the past decade.

Conservative pundit Mary Matalin made that claim on CNN's  Situation Room  on Oct. 22, 2009. Matalin warned that the Obama administration is pushing too many big legislative initiatives such as a cap-and-trade plan to slow global warming when the administration should be focusing on the deficit.

""If they care about reducing the deficit, which should be their No. 1 priority ... they're not going to be able to do this — all this other nonsense, cap and trade and all the rest of it. Too much, too fast,"" Matalin said. ""Climate change is a fake issue anyway. ... There is not consensus science on what is causing global climate change. There is climate change, but for the last decade the climate has been cooling. There is the science. There is the data on that. They want to do this because they like to have all these programs being controlled by the government.""

So, Matalin acknowledges that the Earth's temperature is changing, but she's not so sure that those changes are man-made. We'll save the debate over whether climate change is caused by human activity for another day. For now, we're going to check Matalin's claim that the Earth has been cooling in recent years.

Last spring, we checked  a similar claim  made by the Cato Institute, a free-market think tank. The group claimed that there has been no net global warming for over a decade; we found that False because the climate scientists we spoke with said that, while temperatures have remained relatively static over the last decade, very little can be learned about climate change in a 10-year window.

Matalin's office sent us a few articles pertaining to the issue,  two   about  a new book by Christopher Booker, a British author and climate change skeptic, who wrote in the Oct. 25 issue of the British newspaper the  Telegraph  that, ""as the world has already been through two of its coldest winters for decades, with all the signs that we may now be entering a third, the scientific case for (carbon dioxide) threatening the world with warming has been crumbling away on an astonishing scale.""

Another study  , published by Bob Carter, a professor of geology at Australia's James Cook University, in the Jan. 20 issue of the  Australian  newspaper argued that ""global atmospheric temperature reached a peak in 1998, has not warmed since 1995 and, has been cooling since 2002.""

Carter is correct that global temperatures hit a high point in 1998. Several entities — including NASA, the Climate Research Unit in the United Kingdom and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States — track temperature changes. Generally speaking, their records show that 1998, a year when a warming pattern called El Nino ruled the weather, is the hottest we've had since scientists started collecting temperature information in the mid 1800s. NASA, on the other hand, pins 2005 as the hottest year on record.

But no matter how you slice the data, temperatures have indisputably fluctuated in the last decade, contrary to Matalin's suggestion that they have cooled.  This graph  from NASA shows that the temperature increased slightly between 2000 and 2001, dropped in 2002, and rose once again the following year. In this case, the annual mean temperature goes up and down, and the five-year mean is on a steady rise.  This graph  from NOAA shows a similar trend, with temperatures dipping slightly at the beginning of the decade and peaking once again in 2005.

We asked Richard Heim, a meteorologist at the NOAA National Climatic Data Center Climate Monitoring Branch, what to make of all these ups and downs.

At the most, it shows a plateau, he said. But certainly not a cooling trend.

""With climate change, not every year is going to be warmer,"" Heim said. ""It's two steps up, two steps down — that's not a indication we're on a massive cooling trend.""

NOAA climate monitoring chief Deke Arndt recently  told the Associated Press  the same thing:

""The last 10 years are the warmest 10-year period of the modern record,"" he said. ""Even if you analyze the trend during that 10 years, the trend is actually positive, which means warming.""

If 1998 is the starting point, a year many climate skeptics tend to cite, everything looks cooler in comparison, said Raymond Bradley, a climate scientist at the University of Massachusetts. He also pointed out that, when evaluating the impact of climate change on temperature, it's misleading to look at only the last 10 years.

A decade is such a small period of time that ""it's like saying, 'It was cold here last week. What happened to climate change?'"" Bradley said.

It's a point we heard repeatedly from the climate experts we interviewed. They all agreed that, while climate temperatures may dip from year to year, it's shortsighted to say changes within a decade mean that climate change is going away.

""If you just take a one-year comparison — say that it's cooler in 2008 than it was in 2007 — that's an improper use of statistics"" to make judgments about climate change, said John Reilly, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""It still remains much warmer than it was in the 1960s. To the extent that there has been some slight cooling, we still remain half-a-degree above what it was then.""

Indeed,  climate   records  show that temperatures have been on the rise since the middle of the century, and that fluctuations between recent years are relatively small compared to overall increase. NASA estimates that global temperatures have risen a total of 2.3 degrees since 1895, and that 13 of the warmest years since 1850 have occurred in the last 14 years.

Jim Hurrell, a senior scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., says these natural temperature variations are expected.

""In the same way that El Nino made 1998 warm, in 2007 and 2008, La Nina made global temperatures a bit cooler than they have been running, but still much warmer than the long-term average,"" Hurrell said referring to El Nino's cooler counterpart.

Citing just the last 10 years ""is a classic case of taking the data and letting it tell a very misleading story,"" he said.

Matalin said, ""for the last decade the climate has been cooling."" That suggests there has been a distinct reversal of the steady warming that scientists have documented for many years. But a review of the data shows that's not the case. The numbers show that in the past 10 years, global temperatures have not continued their sharp increase. But they have not cooled either. In fact, some years in the last decade have been hotter than the previous years. At most, they could be described as hitting a plateau. But they haven't cooled as Matalin said",False,"October 27, 2009"
"About 750,000 people die in China each year from auto emissions.","
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has long considered herself a human rights activist and an environmental advocate. So during a recent trip to China, Pelosi discussed how the issues overlap during a meeting with the country's president, Hu Jintao.


She recounted the meeting for television host Charlie Rose on the Oct. 5, 2009, edition of his show. ""I took a little bit of a different approach this time in terms of talking about environmental justice because . . . 750,000 people, approximately, die in China each year from auto emissions. The Gobi Desert is encroaching on the rest of China. There are sandstorms in Beijing. They know that . . . there's something that has to be done about climate change and environmental protection and that — and so my pitch to them is there has to be environmental justice. As you develop and as you compete, you can't leave people behind.""


We wondered if the death toll from auto emissions could possibly be as high as Pelosi claims.


But first, some background. Most scientists believe that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, such as nitrous oxide, are due in part to the number of cars on the road that do not burn fuel efficiently. Our cars release greenhouse gases that trap heat from the sun and have caused the Earth to warm. There's also evidence that the heat-trapping qualities of greenhouse gases lead to an increase of particulate matter and carcinogens in the atmosphere — bad news for those with asthma and other respiratory illnesses.


We called Pelosi's office and they pointed us to 2007 news reports about a World Bank analysis that focused on the cost of pollution in China.


According to the

Financial Times,

the Chinese government asked the World Bank to exclude information about how many people die each year as the result of air and water pollution. (For its part, the World Bank says the numbers were left out due to ""some uncertainties about calculation methods and its application."")

story said. ""A further 300,000 people die prematurely each year from exposure to poor air indoors, according to advisers, but little discussion of this issue survived in the report because it was outside the ambit of the Chinese ministries which sponsored the research.""


On top of that, 60,000 premature deaths were related to poor-quality water that resulted in diarrhea, and stomach, liver and bladder cancers, according to the story.


So, Pelosi is relying on a news story's summary of World Bank data that was not officially published but that was obtained by the

Financial Times.

According to the news story, on the high end, there are 760,000 deaths annually from water and air pollution, not just auto emissions, as Pelosi said on the

Charlie Rose Show.



We took a look at the report, and found that it provided a lot of compelling evidence that Chinese citizens suffer a great deal from air and water pollution and that smog and dirty water in that country lead to many premature deaths. But it offered no overall numbers, nor did it focus specifically on auto emissions.


""Energy consumption, especially coal consumption, is the main source of air pollutants,"" the report said, noting that medical evidence suggests ""outdoor air pollution is a contributing cause of morbidity and mortality.""


To get another perspective, we called Mark Jacobson, a civil and environmental engineering professor at Stanford University, who has studied death rates due to carbon dioxide pollution. In 2008, he found that for each increase of 1 degree Celsius caused by carbon dioxide, the resulting air pollution would lead annually to about 1,000 additional deaths in the United States, and 20,000 worldwide.


That's on top of the approximately 2 million air pollution-related deaths worldwide, he explained, citing numbers from the World Health Organization.


""Home heating and cooking are really the biggest source of deaths,"" Jacobson said, explaining that, particularly in China, India and other developing countries, cooking is often done with animal dung, wood or coal. ""There's a lot of smoke, no ventilation.""


Indeed, most pollution-related deaths — about 1.6 million of the 2 million overall, according to the WHO — are the result of poor indoor air quality.


According to WHO's numbers, that leaves only about 400,000 deaths annually that stem from outdoor pollution — worldwide. Furthermore, outdoor air pollution isn't limited to auto emissions. Much of it comes from agricultural operations, electricity generation and industries that rely heavily on fossil fuels, Jacobson said.


So to summarize: Pelosi said that about 750,000 people in China die annually from auto emissions. But she was basing her claim on news reports that relied on data that was never actually published.  (When we inquired, the World Bank declined to directly address the statistics.) So even if the World Bank data is correct, Pelosi misinterpreted it by saying that all those deaths are related to auto emissions.
 
On top of that, the World Health Organization estimates that most pollution-related deaths are the result of indoor pollutants (those coal and wood fires we mentioned above), not outdoor ones. So while Pelosi is correct that air pollution is harmful and may be responsible for many deaths in China, she's wrong to say that auto emissions are specifically responsible for 750,000 of them annually",True,"October 8, 2009"
"""Not only is there no scientific evidence that CO2 is a pollutant, higher CO2 concentrations actually help ecosystems support more plant and animal life.""","With Congress deep in a debate over legislation to slow climate change, the  Washington Post  has become a  popular place  for climate change claims, including this one from an organization called PlantsNeedCO2.org:
 
""Not only is there no scientific evidence that CO 2 is a pollutant, higher CO 2 concentrations actually help ecosystems support more plant and animal life,"" according to an ad the group published Oct. 5, 2009, in the  Post  .
 
To check this claim, we'll first need to travel back in time to high school biology, when we learned about a little life-sustaining process called photosynthesis. Plants pull carbon dioxide through tiny openings in their leaves where it combines with water and sunlight to create sugar and oxygen. Aside from maintaining normal oxygen levels in the atmosphere, life depends on photosynthesis as a source of energy.
 
Carbon dioxide also plays an important role in climate change. This is naturally occuring — we release it into the atmosphere every time we exhale — but is also emitted when we burn fossil fuels. Along with other greenhouse gases, such as methane and sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide traps energy from the sun in the atmosphere, which causes the Earth's surface temperatures to rise. Most scientists agree that greenhouse gases are primarily responsible for climate change.
 
PlantsNeedCO2.org  is skeptical. The organization, which is still awaiting its nonprofit status, is the brainchild of Leighton Steward, a self-described geologist, environmentalist, author and retired energy industry executive. He authored a diet book called  Sugar Busters!  and is the chairman of the board of the Institute for the Study of Earth and Man at Southern Methodist University. We sent an e-mail to the organization but our inquiry was not returned.
 
PlantsNeedCO2.org has one mission: ""to educate the public on the positive effects of additional atmospheric CO 2 and help prevent the inadvertent negative impact to human, plant and animal life if we reduce CO 2 .""
 
The Web site is chock-full of links to papers, videos and other evidence that more carbon dioxide is actually good for the environment.
 
""Far from being a pollutant, rising atmospheric CO 2 concentrations will never directly harm human health, but will indirectly benefit humans in a number of ways,"" according to the site. ""In addition to increasing the quantity of food available for human consumption, the rising atmospheric CO 2 concentration is also increasing the quality of the foods we eat.""
 
We're going to take the group's claims — that there is no scientific evidence that CO 2 is a pollutant and that higher CO 2 concentrations actually help ecosystems support more plant and animal life — one at a time.
 
First, PlantsNeedCO2.org claims that there is no scientific evidence that carbon dioxide is a pollutant.
 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency disagrees.
 
On April 17, 2009, the agency said that thorough scientific review proved that carbon dioxide, along with several other greenhouse gases, are pollutants that threaten human health; it is taking steps to regulate the gases under the Clean Air Act, a law typically reserved for monitoring traditional pollutants including ozone and sulfur dioxide.
 
""This finding confirms that greenhouse gas pollution is a serious problem now and for future generations,"" said EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson in a press release. ""In both magnitude and probability, climate change is an enormous problem. The greenhouse gases that are responsible for it endanger public health and welfare within the meaning of the Clean Air Act.'""
 
The EPA's findings were ""based on rigorous, peer-reviewed scientific analysis of six gases — carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride — that have been the subject of intensive analysis by scientists around the world. The science clearly shows that concentrations of these gases are at unprecedented levels as a result of human emissions, and these high levels are very likely the cause of the increase in average temperatures and other changes in our climate,"" according to the press release.
 
PlantsNeedCO2.org's second claim — that higher carbon dioxide concentrations boost plant and animal life — is not so clear-cut. To be sure, carbon dioxide is essential to life as we know it, and climate change skeptics have used the argument to reject efforts to reduce greenhouse gases.
 
""Plant physiologists have known for a long time that most vegetation loves more carbon dioxide,"" wrote Roy Spencer, a scientist at the University of Alabama at Huntsville in a 2008  National Review  article. ""It grows faster, is more drought-tolerant, and is more efficient in its water use. While the pre-industrial CO 2 concentration of the atmosphere was only about 280 parts per million (ppm) by volume, and now it is around 380 ppm, some greenhouses pump it all the way up to around 1,000 ppm. How can environmentalists claim that helping vegetation to grow is a bad thing?""
 
So, there's an argument to be made that carbon dioxide concentrations increase plant growth and abundance.
 
But the claim leaves out some important facts, said Rob Jackson, a professor of global environmental change and biology at Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment.
 
""Is carbon dioxide good for plants? The narrow answer is yes,"" said Jackson. ""But I think it's misleading to say that, if CO 2 is good for plants, it's good for the environment. ... It's kind of like saying that steroids are good for people — they build bone and muscle — but they also have other effects.""
 
For example, Jackson's research shows that with higher carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere we would see more wood growth, but that there may also be more pests due to higher temperatures, and longer droughts due to more evaporation.
 
Beyond the  reams  of  scientific research  to demonstrate how dramatically the Earth could change with increased carbon dioxide levels, some studies indicate that more is not necessarily better for plants. For instance, a two-decade study of the Panama and Malaysia rainforests demonstrated that temperature increases of more than 1 degree could lead to 50 percent reduction in tree growth.
 
A study launched in 1997 in California studied the effects of climate change on grasslands. Scientists doubled atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, raised the temperature by 2 degrees, increased precipitation by 50 percent, and raised levels of nitrogen, which is also a product of fossil fuel consumption, to simulate how the Earth might look decades from now. When carbon dioxide levels alone were raised, plants grew quite a bit.
 
""But when we factored in realistic treatments — warming, changes in nitrogen deposition, changes in precipitation — growth was actually suppressed,"" Christopher B. Field, a professor at Stanford, told ScienceDaily in 2002.
 
But back to PlantsNeedCO2.org's claim. They are wrong that carbon dioxide is not considered a pollutant. According to the EPA, it is. And the claim that ""higher CO 2 concentrations actually help ecosystems support more plant and animal life"" leaves out some important details. While carbon dioxide is good for plants, increased amounts of it in our atmosphere will have auxiliary effects that are decidedly bad for ecosystems. For PlantsNeedCO2",False,"October 7, 2009"
"The cap-and-trade bill will mean ""2 million jobs lost.""","EnergyCitizens.org  has a new complaint about the cap-and-trade bill: It's a job killer.
 
In an Oct. 4, 2009, ad in the  Washington Post  , the group said that ""2 million jobs lost"" is ""another unfortunate truth about Congress's climate bill.""

The organization, which includes business associations, antitax groups, transportation companies and the American Petroleum Institute, has ramped up criticism of the sweeping cap-and-trade bill since the Senate took up its own version of the legislation in late September. The House has already passed its version of the bill; it aims to lower carbon pollution 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050 by capping carbon emissions and requiring firms to buy credits, either from the government or from other companies, to continue polluting.
 
Opponents of cap-and-trade argue that forcing industry to buy pollution credits will ultimately harm consumers and business. They argue that phasing out fossil fuels will require big job cuts and many employment opportunities will be sent overseas.
 
EnergyCitizens.org is among the critics.
 
The group's ad cites a May 27 study of the House bill written for the National Black Chamber of Commerce, which opposes the bill, by private consulting firm CRA International. The study predicts that net job losses could be as high as 2.5 million by 2030 and 3 million in 2050.
 
CRA International does not dispute the fact that cap-and-trade would create new jobs. But, ""despite the promise of green jobs, ACESA would, if enacted, inevitably depress total employment from baseline levels. The bill would divert resources now used to produce additional goods and services into the work of obtaining energy from sources that are more costly than fossil fuels.""  That outlook doesn't square with what we've been hearing from lawmakers who support a cap-and-trade plan. The backers of the House version say the legislation would create ""millions of new clean-energy jobs.""

The authors of the Senate version say, ""This bill includes targeted protection for our manufacturing sector to ensure that American companies remain competitive and jobs remain here at home. New programs will train workers to succeed in the new energy economy. Agriculture and rural America will see a boom in investments in biofuels and alternative energy sources.""
 
Both bills include funding for worker training and expanded unemployment benefits; for example, the House bill would provide 156 weeks of benefits, helping to pay for health insurance, job training and employment search assistance  to those who lose their jobs  as the result of cap-and-trade.
 
But neither House nor Senate lawmakers working on the legislation have pinned down exactly how many jobs their bills would eliminate and create, so we decided to look at other estimates.
 
The Center for American Progress, another liberal group, says the bill could create a net increase of about 1.7 million jobs so long as $150 billion is dedicated to the clean-energy industry every year.
 
""These job gains would be enough — on their own — to reduce the unemployment rate in today’s economy by about one full percentage point, to 8.4 percent from current 9.4 percent levels — even after taking into full account the inevitable job losses in conventional fossil fuel sectors of the U.S. economy as they contract,"" according to the June 2009 report.
 
And a second analysis done by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a group that is supporting the bill, estimates that the cap-and-trade bill could create anywhere between 600,000 and 1 million new jobs by 2030.
 
Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office issued a report in September 2009 that the cap-and-trade plan would have a minor effect on employment in the long-run.
 
""The small effect on overall employment would mask a significant shift in the composition of employment over time,"" according to the report. ""A cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide emissions would reduce the number of jobs in industries that produce carbon-based energy, use energy intensively in their production processes, or produce products whose use involves energy consumption, because those industries would experience the greatest increases in costs and declines in sales."" But ""the shifts in demand caused by the policy would also create new employment opportunities in some industries.""

Stephen Seidel, vice president for policy analysis and general counsel at the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said, ""Estimating jobs is a very difficult task for the limited modeling tools that we have."" Jobs will almost certainly be lost and created under a cap-and-trade program, it's just a matter to what degree, he said. The CRA International report used in the EnergyCitizens.org ad ""falls on the high end.""

So, back to EnergyCitizens.org's claim that 2 million jobs will be lost under cap-and-trade. As we've shown, the job predictions are all over the map. Supporters of cap-and-trade predict an increase. CRA, which was hired by an opponent of the proposal, says jobs will be lost. The independent CBO characterizes it as a wash.

Of all these groups, we're inclined to believe the CBO, since it is independent. But we can't rule out the possibility that there could be gains or losses on either end, as the predictions aligned with supporters and opponents suggest",True,"October 5, 2009"
"""There's no evidence anywhere that offshore drilling has hurt tourism in any area where it has been allowed.""","
A leading advocate for oil drilling off the west coast of Florida is making his case by saying drilling has never been bad for tourism.
 
Ever.
 
""There's no evidence anywhere that offshore drilling has hurt tourism in any area where it has been allowed,"" said Barney Bishop, president of Associated Industries of Florida, a statewide business lobbying group. ""High energy costs and high unemployment kill tourism more than anything. Without affordable gas, we can't get tourists to Florida.""
 
Can oil and tourism mix?
 
Bishop's statement is focused on offshore drilling and not spills in general. It's an important distinction. Large-scale oil spills are more likely to be caused by tanker and barge crashes, not offshore drilling, according to the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences.
 
So while Florida beaches and tourism were affected by a three-barge collision that sent 330,000 gallons of oil and jet fuel into Tampa Bay area waters in 1993, it wasn't as a direct result of offshore drilling.
 
To get to the root of Bishop's claim, then, offshore oil drilling itself has to be the culprit.
 
The record there is thin, but not bare.
 
An oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico 600 miles south of the Texas coastline malfunctioned in June 1979, sending oil pouring into gulf waters. According to estimates, the well, called Ixtoc 1, spewed 3.3 million barrels of oil before being capped in March 1980. The oil traveled north to soil 200 miles of Texas beach.
 
Did that spill, one of the worst in history, hurt Texas tourism?
 
""Sure it did,"" said Tony Amos, a research associate at the University of Texas at Austin Marine Science Institute. ""Because vast amounts of tar came up on our beaches.""
 
Private groups and people connected with the tourist trade filed more than $300 million in lawsuits after the Ixtoc spill, saying the damage cost them that much in business, according to a 1980 Associated Press article.
 
On South Padre Island, the mayor at the time, Glenn McGehee, said the spill cost his area $15 million. After the spill was cleaned up, the island's tourism bureau spent $200,000 on a new ad campaign: ""Come on down, the coast is clear.""
 
Tourism in other parts of south Texas was reported down anywhere from 30 to 60 percent, according to newspaper accounts, and several communities said they lost millions of dollars as a result from the spill.
 
And a 1982 study conducted for the U.S. Interior Department found that Texas beaches in the South Padre Island area lost tourism revenues between $3.98 million and $4.44 million.
 
""The Ixtoc well spill pretty much shut down tourism,"" said F. Charles Lamphear, a retired University of Nebraska at Lincoln professor who co-authored the 1982 study. Lamphear did point out that some of the losses were offset by cleanup-related funding.
 
Another oft-discussed incident, a 1969 oil drilling accident off the coast of Santa Barbara, Calif., also affected tourism in that community, according to Santa Barbara County officials. The U.S. Coast Guard estimated that 100,000 barrels of crude oil spilled during the accident.
 
""The tourist industry suffered in 1969; however, tourism recovered in subsequent years,"" county officials in Santa Barbara write on their government Web site. ""A class-action lawsuit awarded nearly $6.5 million to owners of beachfront homes, apartments, hotels and motels.""
 
A public relations firm representing Bishop provided a six-page brief to PolitiFact to support his comments. The brief acknowledges direct impacts on tourism, but calls them somewhat rare and short-lived.
 
One synopsis of a study of the Santa Barbara spill notes that the region lost ""only"" $3.15 million in recreational activity dollars. In 2008 dollars, that translates to almost $18.5 million.
 
Another study said that while losses by beachfront businesses in Santa Barbara may have suffered, other businesses farther inland benefited.
 
Using superlatives and absolutes might make for the best sound bite, but it also makes it more difficult to be right. Bishop said, ""There's no evidence anywhere that offshore drilling has hurt tourism in any area where it has been allowed,” and the record shows otherwise. Though infrequent, incidents of offshore drilling directly and adversely affecting an area's tourist economy do exist",False,"October 5, 2009"
"""The truth is any oil that would be drilled could be sent to any other country in the world, reducing our use of foreign oil not by one single drop.""","The whole fervor behind ""Drill, baby drill!"" was to reduce America’s dependence on foreign oil, right? We thought so, too. So listen to this: U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, the Florida Democrat opposing drilling closer to Florida's shoreline, says increased drilling in the Gulf of Mexico might not help America at all. ""Supporters of opening up the eastern gulf say that we need to do it to help get America off foreign oil,"" Nelson  said  on the Senate floor in June. ""Tell me then why isn't there a clause in the drilling amendment that was passed specifying that all oil and natural gas that would be produced in the eastern gulf … stay in the United States for domestic consumption? ""But no, that's not there. Because the truth is any oil that would be drilled could be sent to any other country in the world, reducing our use of foreign oil not by one single drop."" Naturally, we wondered if Nelson's claim about oil drilling in the gulf is true. His comments refer to the massive energy bill sitting in the U.S. Senate. The bill, officially called the American Clean Energy Leadership Act of 2009, would allow oil drilling within 45 miles of the Florida coastline and closer in areas near the Panhandle. We examined the 532-page bill to see what would become of that newfound oil and found no restrictions on where it ends up. We confirmed that with David Marks, press assistant at the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. ""There are no restrictions in the bill,"" he said. While the bill contains no limits on where the oil can flow, there have been limits placed on American oil previously. During the 1973 Arab oil embargo, Congress authorized the construction of a Trans-Alaska Pipeline System to funnel oil from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez, Alaska. But the approval came with a restriction: Alaska oil could not be exported. The ban remained in place until 1996, according to the Energy Information Administration, an arm of the U.S. Department of Energy. So without a ban, the crude oil collected in the eastern Gulf of Mexico could indeed be shipped anywhere. Would it though? The answer is most likely not. Currently, almost all of the crude oil pumped in the western Gulf of Mexico is transported via a 10,000-mile pipeline network to U.S. shores. That crude oil is then mixed with imported crude oil and refined at onshore facilities into gasoline, jet fuel and kerosene. Some of the oil even becomes asphalt. Paul Hess, an analyst at the Energy Information Administration, said ""very little"" gulf crude oil is exported, if any. ""It's a very small amount,"" Hess said. ""We don't track that level of detail."" Offshore oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico produced about 1.17 million barrels of crude oil a day in 2008. In 2006, for instance, the EIA recorded crude oil exports in its gulf coast region — which is made up of more than just the Gulf of Mexico — at 1,000 barrels of crude oil a day. In 2008, there were no recorded exports. Mickey Driver, a spokesman with Chevron, said that all of his company's 200,000 barrels a day of gulf oil is shipped via pipeline to the United States, where it is consumed. ""It would make no economic sense and it would absolutely make no process sense to do anything else,"" Driver said. In other words, why pay to ship gulf crude around the world when an oil-hungry U.S. market is right there waiting to pay for it? The United States already has to import about two-thirds of the crude oil it uses. It should be noted that a Brazilian company, Petrobras, is in the process of building a type of offshore refinery that would process crude oil offshore rather than build a pipeline to the Louisiana coast. That refined oil then would be moved by tanker ship. Petrobras America spokesman Ciro Ribeiro said the offshore processing facility will be up and running in 2010. ""The destination should be the domestic market,"" Ribeiro said. ""Any port in the Gulf of Mexico."" Nelson is right when he says that ""oil that would be drilled could be sent to any other country in the world,"" because the federal legislation doesn’t now include any limits. But he doesn't offer the broader context. History shows that most domestic crude oil is used domestically",Half True,"October 5, 2009"
Gas will reach $4 a gallon under a cap-and-trade plan.,"In a full-page ad in the Sept. 30, 2009, edition of the  Washington Post  , was this eye-catching claim about gas prices:
 
""$4 GAS - Another unfortunate truth about the House's climate bill,"" said the ad from  EnergyCitizens.org  . ""As Congress considers new climate legislation, Americans aren't getting the whole truth. A recent study found the House-passed bill could lead to $4 per-gallon gasoline. America is in the middle of a harsh recession. Think about the impact of $4 gas.""
 
We've heard a lot about the cap-and-trade plan — that it  will increase   the cost   of energy  and that it will  eliminate jobs  — but it's been a while since we put  claims about the price of gas  to the Truth-O-Meter.
 
The concept of cap-and-trade is relatively easy to understand. A cap is put on greenhouse gas emissions, and firms are required to buy credits, either from the government or from other companies, to continue polluting. Iterations of a cap-and-trade plan have been introduced in Congress previously, but the most recent legislation, written by Democrats Henry Waxman of California and Ed Markey of Massachusetts, has been passed by the House of Representatives. Their bill aims to lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Under their plan, most pollution permits initially would be given out free. But eventually, companies would have to buy those permits from the government.
 
Opponents of cap-and-trade argue that forcing industry to buy pollution credits will ultimately harm consumers and business. Firms will have no choice but to pass on the cost of buying those permits. And that's where the argument from EnergyCitizens.org comes into play. The group, a coalition of business organizations, antitax groups, transportation companies, and Washington heavy hitters such as the American Petroleum Institute and the American Farm Bureau Federation, says those higher prices will hit consumers in the form of higher gas prices.
 
The ad cites a Heritage Foundation study of the bill published on June 16. The conservative think tank, which has been critical of the Waxman-Markey bill, contends higher energy prices ""will spread throughout the economy as producers everywhere try to cover their higher production costs by raising their product prices. ... Even after adjusting for inflation, gasoline prices will rise 58 percent over the 2035 baseline price.""
 
We checked with the Heritage Foundation to find out if EnergyCitizens.org was correctly interpreting Heritage's study, and were told that the group was. Heritage also pointed us to another study the think tank did that looked at gas prices per state. Heritage assumes that under Waxman-Markey, gas will be at a minimum $3 a gallon in 2035, depending on where you live. A 58 percent price increase as a result of cap-and-trade would put the cost of a gallon of gasoline at more that $4.
 
So, based on Heritage's data and assumptions, EnergyCitizens.org is in the ballpark. However, the group leaves out an important detail in its ad: These predictions are for 2035, 26 years from now when, presumably, our economic landscape will be very different. EnergyCitizens.org plays on people's anxiety about the recession by portraying these prices as something that would take effect immediately.
 
To get more perspective, we looked at other estimates. For comparison, keep in mind that the current national average is $2.60 for unleaded regular.
 
The Energy Information Administration, a branch of the Energy Department, published an analysis of the bill on Aug. 4, 2009, which predicts gas price increases will be relatively small compared to increases in the electricity sector, in part because emissions reductions from the fossil-fuel sector will only account for 12 to 20 percent of overall reductions. If the bill is enacted, gas prices will only be about 20 cents more per gallon in 2020 and 35 cents more in 2030, the report predicts.
 
Another analysis by the Environmental Protection Agency predicts impacts on future gas prices would be minimal under the Waxman-Markey bill. Specifically, prices would go up $0.13 in 2015, $0.25 in 2030, and $0.69 in 2050, according to the June 23 report.
 
Clearly, there's a difference of opinion on how much the price of gas will change as the result of cap-and-trade. For the most part, those differences have to do with what kind of assumptions are made about nonfossil fuels, such as nuclear and wind power. The EPA, for example, assumes that cleaner technologies and renewable energy will replace fossil fuel more quickly, which would translate to lower costs to consumers. Heritage takes an austere approach, assuming that traditional energy sources would be scaled back to meet new emissions standards, but would not be immediately replaced by new technology or renewable fuels. As a result, fossil fuel prices will go up and continue to rise.
 
Another point to put this all in perspective: Gas prices fluctuate dramatically. In January 2009, a gallon of gas cost about a $1.80 a gallon. This week, gas costs $2.60 — about a $1.20 less than it was a year ago. So predicting how much gas will cost next week — let alone in 2035 — is an imperfect science.

Based on the estimates, it's probably a safe bet that the price of gasoline will ultimately increase as a result of cap-and-trade. And the estimates vary based on reasonable disagreements about methodology. But Energycitizens.org is guilty of a significant exaggeration because the ad strongly implies the price hike would happen very soon. It fails to mention that $4-a-gallon gasoline wouldn't be the norm until 2035 — if it ever is. The group also leaves out other important studies that predict smaller increases",True,"September 30, 2009"
"The Obama administration's cap-and-trade plan would create ""a $1,761 yearly energy tax.""","It's hard to keep track of all those estimates about how much a cap-and-trade bill would cost American families. So, the latest prediction, coming from Sen. Lamar Alexander and other Republicans, is just adding to the confusion.
 
In a Sept. 16, 2009, press release, the Tennessean said, ""American families can’t afford a new $1,761 yearly energy tax.""
 
Similar numbers were widely posted on conservative blogs. A story on the  Weekly Standard  was headlined, ""Obama Admin Concedes: Cap and Trade Will Raise Your Taxes by 15%.""

Those were new numbers to us, so we decided to look into the claim.
 
But first, a little recap. At its heart, cap-and-trade is a simple concept: To slow climate change, the government would set a cap on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. To comply, companies such as electric utilities must either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits — also known as allowances — to continue polluting.
 
The cap-and-trade bill currently making its way through Congress was written by Reps. Henry Waxman and Edward Markey, Democrats from California and Massachusetts, respectively. Their goal is to lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Under their plan, most pollution permits initially would be given out for free. But eventually, companies would have to buy those permits from the government. It's an issue we've explored  several   times   over  .
 
Opponents of cap-and-trade argue that forcing industry to buy pollution credits is nothing more than a tax on consumers and business. Firms will have no choice but to pass the cost of buying those permits on to consumers. There has been much debate about how much those costs could be, and it's been difficult to come up with a reliable number because the bills have been changing as they move through the House and the Senate. Republicans have cited numbers as high as $3,000 per year, a claim that when it was combined with a falsehood on health care, earned our Pants on Fire rating. Republicans often refer to it as a tax, although we have found that is incorrect. Only utilities that exceed their limits would have to pay for the allowances, which does not sound to us like a tax on families. Recent estimates by the Congressional Budget Office and the Environmental Protection Agency are much lower — between $80 and $340 a year, depending on income.
 
The new numbers spring from some Treasury Department documents recently acquired by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, through a Freedom of Information Act request. Some of the documents are from 2008, shortly after the election, according to the group, and others are undated, though they appear to be from early 2009.
 
Nowhere in the documents does the Treasury Department cite the $1,761 figure. It seems Alexander got that number from a Sept. 15, 2009, story by Declan McCullagh, a blogger who writes the ""Taking Liberties"" column for CBS News. (Our calls to Alexander's office were not returned.) So it's worth noting that Alexander is relying not on a study by an economist, but on an estimate from a blogger.
 
""The Obama administration has privately concluded that a cap and trade law would cost American taxpayers up to $200 billion a year, the equivalent of hiking personal income taxes by about 15 percent,"" McCullagh wrote. ""A previously unreleased analysis prepared by the U.S. Department of Treasury says the total in new taxes would be between $100 billion to $200 billion a year. At the upper end of the administration's estimate, the cost per American household would be an extra $1,761 a year.""
 
We contacted McCullagh via e-mail, and he told us that he came up with $1,761 per household annually by simply dividing the number $200 billion by the number of households in the United States. According to the census, there are about 113.5 million households in the country this year.
 
We reviewed the estimate with people involved in the climate change debate who told us there are significant flaws in McCullagh's methodology. Stephen Seidel, vice president for policy analysis and general counsel for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said the math is too simple and doesn't reflect the true impact of the House bill, which specifies that any revenue from the plan be rebated to consumers to offset higher electrical bills they might have to pay. ""What [Treasury] was looking at was a situation where 100 percent of the permits were auctioned, and ignored what would be done with revenue,"" he said. The Waxman-Markey bill ""uses revenue to offset cost to consumers.""
 
There also have been changes to the bill since that Treasury document was created. Obama originally envisioned that every polluting permit would be sold, starting when the bill was enacted. But in the spirit of compromise, Waxman and Markey scaled back that plan by giving about 85 percent of the permits for free in the early years of the bill's implementation.

Also, under the latest version of the Waxman-Markey bill, which passed the House in June, 30 to 40 percent of the revenue would go back to electric utilities to be passed on to consumers to offset higher rates they would have to pay. The money would be passed to consumers through rebates or expanded efficiency programs, and an additional 15 percent of the revenue would go directly to low-income consumers.

""The bottom line is that it goes back to the consumers,"" Seidel said.
 
Seidel said there's another problem with the blogger's report, as quoted by the senator: the Treasury documents report that $100 billion to $200 billion in revenue raised each year by selling those pollution permits we mentioned earlier. Alexander and McCullagh incorrectly portray them as taxes. There are legitimate questions that can be raised about how much the cost might ultimately be passed on to consumers, but it is not correct to refer to the revenue as a tax.

And higher energy costs are not a sure thing. Regional cap-and-trade programs in Europe and in the northeast United States show that auctioning most or all credits have actually decreased the cost of energy, said Barry Rabe, a public policy professor at the University of Michigan.
 
""What we've seen is that there's a lot of volatility,"" he said. ""It's hard to make those projections and say how these things are going to work as a result. That just underscores the difficulty of attaching numbers to these things that people can live with.""

Alan Krueger, the Obama administration's assistant treasury secretary for economic policy, sent us this statement via e-mail:
 
""The reporting on the Treasury memo is flat-out wrong,"" he wrote. ""Treasury's summary is consistent with public analyses by the EIA [Energy Information Administration], EPA, and CBO, and the reporting and blogging on this issue ignore the fact that the revenue raised from emission permits would be returned to consumers under both administration and legislative proposals.""
 
We spoke with Christopher Horner with the Competitive Enterprise Institute about the documents. He conceded that they don't reflect legislation currently under consideration, but he pointed out that the Senate is planning to start from scratch on the climate issue.
 
""Congress writes legislation for one reason,"" Horner said. ""This [document] sets forth the administration's desire and expectations.""
 
In the meantime, McCullagh has been  fielding criticism  about his column. On Sept. 16 he defended his analysis and wrote that revenue returned to consumers in the form of tax cuts and rebates is uncertain.
 
""The tax revenue might end up being directed at income tax cuts (or rescuing kittens and feeding orphans, for that matter), or it could end up being wasted on boondoggles,"" he wrote. ""If it is returned to American citizens, it's unlikely to be a wash: some people will end up paying much more in taxes, some will pay a little more, and some will see a net benefit.""
 
But back to Alexander's original claim. His statement that households will pay $1,761 in new taxes every year is based on a blogger's incorrect assumptions and overly simple math. The estimate does not account for revenue that will be returned to consumers in the form of rebates and other efficiency measures. Furthermore, the number is based on old numbers; the Treasury estimate was written on the premise that all permits would be sold, which, ultimately, is not the form that the Waxman-Markey legislation has taken. Finally, both Alexander and McCullagh portray money raised by selling these permits as a tax",False,"September 18, 2009"
"Van Jones ""is an avowed, self-avowed radical revolutionary communist.""","Radio and TV political commentator Glenn Beck has spent weeks detailing what he says is a web of Obama administration officials with socialist or communist ties. And Exhibit A in the Beck argument has been Van Jones, Obama's so-called green jobs czar (his actual title was special adviser for green jobs at the Council on Environmental Quality). Conservative commentators and bloggers criticized Jones because of his past remarks and his involvement with controversial groups. His resignation was announced shortly after midnight on Sept. 6, 2009. Beck has repeatedly claimed Jones is a communist. For purposes of a fact-check statement, we selected a Sept. 1, 2009, remark Beck made on his radio program that Jones ""is an avowed, self-avowed radical revolutionary communist."" There's little question that Jones  was  an avowed communist. In a Nov. 2, 2005, profile of Jones in the  East Bay Express  , an alternative weekly in Berkeley, Calif., Jones said his life hit a turning point in the spring of 1992 when he was swept up in mass arrests while protesting the acquittal of police officers accused of beating Rodney King. Although the charges against Jones were dropped, Jones said that while in jail, ""I met all these young radical people of color — I mean really radical, communists and anarchists. And it was, like, 'This is what I need to be a part of.' I spent the next 10 years of my life working with a lot of those people I met in jail, trying to be a revolutionary."" ""In the months that followed,"" the  Express  article said, ""he let go of any lingering thoughts that he might fit in with the status quo. 'I was a rowdy nationalist on April 28th, and then the verdicts came down on April 29th,' he said. 'By August, I was a communist.'"" In 1994, the story states, Jones formed a socialist collective called Standing Together to Organize a Revolutionary Movement, or STORM. According to a history of STORM written in the spring of 2004, the group held ""structured political education"" training at every meeting ""to help members develop an understanding of the basics of Marxist politics."" They ""trained members on capitalism and wage exploitation, the state and revolution, imperialism and the revolutionary party."" So Jones was a self-avowed communist. But is he still? The answer lies in the very same article. Even before the group disbanded in 2002, the  Express  article says, ""Jones began transforming his politics and work..."" According to the article, ""He took an objective look at the movement's effectiveness and decided that the changes he was seeking were actually getting farther away. Not only did the left need to be more unified, he decided, it might also benefit from a fundamental shift in tactics. 'I realized that there are a lot of people who are capitalists — shudder, shudder — who are really committed to fairly significant change in the economy, and were having bigger impacts than me and a lot of my friends with our protest signs,' he said."" In recent years, Jones established himself as a leading, charismatic cheerleader for transitioning the American economy to green jobs. We weren't able to find any recent interviews where Jones directly addresses the question of where he stands on communism. When he resigned this week, Jones said he was the victim of a ""vicious smear campaign"" by conservatives and decided to resign so as not to be a distraction. ""I cannot in good conscience ask my colleagues to expend precious time and energy defending or explaining my past,"" he said in a released statement. But check out these two statements and see if this sounds like a communist. This, from his book,  The Green Collar Economy  , released in October 2008: ""There will surely be an important role for nonprofit voluntary, cooperative, and community-based solutions,"" Jones writes on page 86. ""But the reality is that we are entering an era during which our very survival will demand invention and innovation on a scale never before seen in the history of human civilization. Only the business community has the requisite skills, experience, and capital to meet that need. On that score, neither the government nor the nonprofit and voluntary sectors can compete, not even remotely. ""So in the end, our success and survival as a species are largely and directly tied to the new eco-entrepreneurs — and the success and survival of their enterprises. Since almost all of the needed eco-technologies are likely to come from the private sector, civic leaders and voters should do all that can be done to help green business leaders succeed. That means, in large part, electing leaders who will pass bills to aid them. We cannot realistically proceed without a strong alliance between the best of the business world — and everyone else."" Or how about this, from an address before the Center for American Progress on Nov. 19, 2008 (well before Jones was brought into the Obama administration): ""Everything that is good for the environment, everything that's needed to beat global warming, is a job,"" Jones said. ""Solar panels don't manufacture themselves. Wind turbines don't manufacture themselves. Homes don't weatherize themselves. Every single thing that we need to beat global warming will also beat the recession. And the challenge is, how do we get the government to be a smart, and limited, catalyst in getting the private sector to take on this challenge?"" That doesn't sound Marxist to us. Beck would have been on solid ground if he said Jones  used to be  a communist. Jones has been up front about that. But Beck has repeatedly said Jones  is  a communist. Present tense. Although we could not find a comment in which Jones explicitly said why he is no longer one, we found ample evidence that he now believes capitalism is the best force for the social change he is seeking. So there's truth to Beck's claim in that Jones  was  a communist, but it's apparent he isn't any longer, as Beck suggests",True,"September 8, 2009"
"""Cap-and-trade is wildly unpopular with Americans.""","The editorial board of  Investor's Business Daily  says the supporters of a cap-and-trade bill face an uphill battle. 
 
In a Sept. 2, 2009, op-ed about the European stake in a climate change bill passed by the House of Representatives, the editors wrote, ""Cap-and-trade is wildly unpopular with Americans. No matter how many suave European continentals you send here, it won't change voters' minds.""
 
To support their claim, the board included a June 28-29 Rasmussen poll that shows that 56 percent of Americans said they wouldn't pay more taxes to cut greenhouse gases. The question — and the op-ed — leave out the important fact that the bill doesn't impose new taxes (though it's likely people would see higher utility bills as the result of cap-and-trade, which would raise the cost of energy at least slightly).
 
But the claim piqued our interest nevertheless, so we decided to check other polls to see how the plan is playing among voters.
 
The background: Cap-and-trade is a way to slow climate change by reducing carbon emissions. The idea is to cap emissions and require firms to either buy polluting permits or upgrade to cleaner technologies. House lawmakers included such a plan in a bill passed on June 26 that will lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050.
 
So let's look at how much support it has. A  Washington Post  /ABC News survey published on June 25, a day before the bill was passed, showed that 75 percent of Americans think the government should regulate greenhouse gas emissions to reduce global warming. About 52 percent support a cap-and-trade program to accomplish that. Opposition has grown to 42 percent, up from 34 percent in the summer of 2008.
 
The same pollsters did a follow-up survey Aug. 13-17 and found that support for cap-and-trade was unchanged. This time, however, the poll provided more detail. About 58 percent said they would support the idea if it raised monthly electric bills by 10 dollars. But when that cost went up to 25 dollars, support dropped to 39 percent.
 
(We've already explored different opinions on how much the legislation might cost, and you can read about them  here  .)
 
Meanwhile, a Zogby poll published on Aug. 11 found that 71 percent of Americans support the legislation that was passed in the House.
 
It's worth noting that all those numbers are up from polls that were taken earlier in the year, before the bill was debated and passed in the House. For example, in April, a Zogby poll found that 30 percent of respondents supported cap-and-trade. And a CNN poll done one month later found that 44 percent favor a cap-and-trade plan. 
 
So, given the most recent polling, it would be fair to say that a slight majority of Americans support cap-and-trade but that those numbers may decrease depending on how much it would cost in higher utility bills. Even so, at its lowest, nearly 40 percent of Americans would still support cap-and-trade even if it meant heftier energy bills",False,"September 3, 2009"
"""Scientists project that the Arctic will be ice-free in the summer of 2013.""","Sen. John Kerry says climate change is happening faster than we think.
 
In an Aug. 31, 2009, op-ed in the Huffington Post, the Massachusetts Democrat wrote that the threat of climate change ""is not an abstract concern for the future.""
 
""It is already upon us and its effects are being felt worldwide, right now,"" he wrote. ""Scientists project that the Arctic will be ice-free in the summer of 2013. Not in 2050, but four years from now. Make no mistake: catastrophic climate change represents a threat to human security, global stability, and — yes — even to American national security.""
 
We don't debate that the effects of climate change are already being felt. However, Kerry's claim that the Arctic will be ice-free in as little as five years is ominous and worth putting to the Truth-O-Meter.

Arctic ice has long been considered a canary in a coal mine for climate scientists; they watch it closely because significant melts indicate an acceleration of climate change effects. In fact, temperatures actually rise faster in icy regions because of something known as ice albedo feedback loop. Ice is more reflective than land or water. When ice melts, the reflectivity of the Earth's surface decreases as well, and more solar radiation is absorbed by the land and the oceans. So, as ice melts, more and more heat from the sun is absorbed, accelerating the warming process.

Melting has recently become a more serious problem, and 2007 was a particularly bad year for the Arctic. Then, about 552 billion tons of ice melted from Greenland's ice sheet during the summer — about 15 percent more than the summer average.

The summer of 2009 didn't look much better. According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, the average rate of melt in July of this year is nearly identical to that of July 2007, in part due to unusual weather patterns and an underlying trend toward higher temperatures.

But does this mean ice will be completely gone in the next few years? We talked to Julienne Stroeve, a researcher for the NSIDC, for some perspective.

Climate scientists ""agree that we'll lose summer ice cover,"" she said. ""As to the exact date, it varies between groups."" The summer ice cover is what's left of the sea ice after the annual seasonal melting. It refreezes when temperatures drop. Indeed, predictions are all over the map. Kerry got his data from Wieslaw Maslowski, a researcher from the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif., who as early as 2007 predicted the Arctic would be ice-free by the summer of 2013. Similar projections have been trumpeted by a handful of other scientists, including Warwick Vincent, director of the Center for Northern Studies at Laval University in Quebec and NASA climate scientist Jay Zwally. (A Kerry spokeswoman directed us to this 2007  article  about Maslowski's work.)

Meanwhile, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations group relying on the consensus of hundreds of climate scientists, estimated in 2007 that summer ice would largely be gone in the latter part of the 21st century; and Stroeve said NSIDC supports a prediction of 2030.

NASA climate researcher Gavin Schmidt wrote in an e-mail to us that Maslowski's prediction isn't necessarily a communitywide opinion.

""A fair statement would be that some scientists have predicted summer ice free Arctic Ocean as soon as 2013, but others expect it to happen a little slower — say 2040-2060,"" Schmidt wrote.

Differences occur when research focuses on the area of the Arctic — based on aerial satellite photographs — or on thickness and volume of the ice as well as area, according to Maslowski. In both cases, scientists have seen melting, Maslowski said. However, when estimates are based on the latter method, as Maslowski and his team of researchers have done, melting seems to be happening much faster.

""There is no crystal ball, there is no final prediction, just estimates,"" Maslowski said. ""All we are trying to show is that we better start thinking [ice-free summers] could start earlier than 2100 or 2030. We should be prepared for the worst-case scenario.""

Kerry's claim also leaves out an important nuance; as Stroeve said, most climate scientists agree that  summer  ice is likely to disappear at some point, but that the oceans will still freeze in the winter for a very long time. However, Kerry's op-ed could make it sound as if the Arctic will devoid of ice all year long.

As always with the climate change debate, we've found that there's a wide range of informed opinion on the issue of Arctic melting. In a general sense, Kerry is correct that Arctic ice is melting at a quickening rate. However, he has based his prediction on the earliest and most extreme estimate, when a much wider range of estimates are available and most project the turning point will occur decades from now. And he makes it seem as if the Arctic will be totally ice-free within a few short years when in fact that would only be true for the summer",True,"September 2, 2009"
"If you log into the government's Cash for Clunkers Web site (cars.gov) from your home computer, the government can ""seize all of your personal and private"" information, and track your computer activity.","On Glenn Beck's Fox News program on July 31, 2009, Fox anchor Kimberly Guilfoyle suggested that clicking on the government's Cash for Clunkers Web page (cars.gov) would give the government complete access to your home computer. The accusation came in a back-and-forth exchange among Beck, Guilfoyle and Jonah Goldberg, author of  Liberal Fascism.  After warning viewers not to try this at home, Beck typed in cars.gov., the U.S. Department of Transportation Web site for the program better known as Cash for Clunkers. ""Here is Cars.gov,"" Beck said. ""Let's say you go in. If I understand this right, I go in and I say, 'I want to turn in my clunker.' The dealer goes to Cars.gov, and then they hit 'submit transaction.' Here it says 'privacy act and security statement,' and it's like, oh, it's the Privacy Act of 1974. Whatever. I agree.""

But when you pull it up, he noted, here's how the warning statement read: ""This application provides access to the DOT CARS system. When logged on to the CARS system, your computer is considered a federal computer system and it is property of the United States Government. Any or all uses of this system and all files on this system may be intercepted, monitored, recorded, copied, audited, inspected, and disclosed to authorized CARS, DOT, and law enforcement personnel, as well as authorized officials of other agencies, both domestic and foreign.""

""Good God Almighty!"" Beck said.

Said Guilfoyle: ""Could it be any more broad and frightening? Here you are trying to be a good citizen and make a charitable contribution, do something that's good — and guess what? They are jumping right inside you, seizing all of your personal and private (information) ... And it's absolutely legal, Glenn. They can do it.""

""They can continue to track you basically forever,"" Guilfoyle warned. ""Once they tap into your system, the government, of course, has like malware systems and tracking cookies and they can tap in anytime they want.""

""Can you believe that?"" she asked. ""I mean, seriously, they can get all your information.""

Later, Goldberg said it was ""all very troubling. And, look, let me give you a hard example of this. Say you use Skype or some other Internet phone system, right? If you're on the phone while logged in on this thing, according to this, according to a lawyer I talked to before ... the government can legally listen to your phone call. They can check out what Web sites you've been searching.""

""Because it says ... your computer is a government's property,"" Goldberg said.

""That's correct, if you log on to this at your home, everything in your home is now theirs?"" Beck asked.

""Basically,"" Guilfoyle said, ""and there's nothing you can do."" To dissect this one, we have to begin by noting the small amount of truth in their comments. The statement Beck read was on a government Web site for auto dealers, but Guilfoyle twists that into some incorrect claims about the government getting access to individuals. Here's the true part: The Department of Transportation confirmed the language was on the cars.gov Web site, but on Aug. 3 it was removed. The DOT released this statement to PolitiFact: ""A security warning on the CARS.gov dealer support page that stated computers logged into the system were considered property of the Federal Government has been removed.  We are working to revise the language.  The language was posted on the portion of the website accessible by car dealers and not the general public."" ""It would be factually inaccurate to say that any computer that went to cars.gov would become the property of the U.S. government,"" said Sasha Johnson, a DOT spokeswoman said. Although Beck began his segment by noting that the warning was on a part of the site for dealers, Guilfoyle then distorted the truth by suggesting it applied to members of the general public coming to the site for information about Cash for Clunkers. The allegations escalated as she and Goldberg issued warnings about anyone even typing in that address at home. And that's just wrong. Beck seemed to concede that point when raising the issue again on Aug. 3. ""Now, these blogs have come out this weekend and said, 'Oh, there goes Glenn Beck trying to stir up trouble again. It doesn't affect the average person. It's just the car dealerships.' I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just the car dealerships. Oh, so then I shouldn't care? It's not the average people? It's just the average people who are in small business running the car dealerships,"" Beck said. DOT's Johnson said the government has no plans to take over the computer of auto dealers either. And, again, the language was removed on Aug. 3. But the language was there when Beck and Guilfoyle first raised their concerns. And clearly the language was overly broad, and bad enough to give ammunition to conspiracy theorists. That much is implied by the fact the government felt the need to remove the language. So in that sense, we think the DOT bears some blame for the confusion. Had she said from the start that this just applied to dealers completing transactions, we might be more generous in our ruling. But we think anyone who saw the July 31 program — in which she claimed ""seriously, they can get all your information"" — would be left with the clear impression that anyone who logged into the cars.gov site was opening their computer to Big Brother",False,"August 3, 2009"
"""Job losses are so certain under this new cap-and-tax plan that it includes a provision accommodating newly unemployed workers from the resulting dried-up energy sector, to the tune of $4.2 billion over eight years. So much for creating jobs.""","Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has been making waves in the blogosphere with a recent op-ed on cap-and-trade.
 
Her critics say Palin's July 14, 2009, piece in the  Washington Post  gets it all wrong. It ""displays an ignorance for the subject so profound it's almost gutsy,"" Conor Clarke wrote in the  Atlantic  .  Keith Olberman said on  Countdown  that she uses ""the sky-is-falling tactics.""
 
We've explored other aspects of the cap-and-trade bill before, including  how much it would cost  lower-income consumers (Palin says it would hit them hardest, but the independent Congressional Budget Office predicts it would actually put money in the pockets of the poorest), as well as  how much of an impact  the bill would really have on climate.
 
Today, we're tackling this claim from Palin's op-ed: ""Job losses are so certain under this new cap-and-tax plan that it includes a provision accommodating newly unemployed workers from the resulting dried-up energy sector, to the tune of $4.2 billion over eight years. So much for creating jobs.""
 
Before we dig into Palin's statement, here's a quick summary of how the cap-and-trade bill, authored by Reps. Henry Waxman of California and Edward Markey of Massachusetts, would work. The bill aims to slow climate change by lowering carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. To do that, the bill would cap yearly carbon emissions, and to comply, companies will have to either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits to continue polluting. Initially, the government's permits for polluters would be given out for free. But eventually, companies would have to buy those permits from the government.

Palin and other Republicans say they are concerned that the transition will be costly to industry — particularly companies in the energy sector — and that workers will lose their jobs as a result.
 
The authors of the bill are also concerned — so much so that they included the program Palin refers to. Should workers lose their jobs, they would get 156 weeks of benefits, including 70 percent of their average weekly wage, help paying for health insurance, job training and employment search assistance.
 
So, Palin is correct that the bill has a program for displaced workers.

Funding for the program would come from selling those pollution allowances we mentioned earlier.

Supporters of cap-and-trade argue that Palin's statement is misleading because she makes it seem like, overall, the bill is killing jobs. They say she neglects to point out that it will add thousands of jobs in industries that will grow because of the dramatic policy change. Bracken Hendricks, a senior fellow with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, recently predicted the bill would create 1.7 million new jobs. The program Palin's talking about will also help train those workers to participate in the emerging industry.
 
""In an economic shift from pollution to clean energy, some sectors will see impacts,"" he said. ""But this policy isn't about job loss, it's about anticipated growth. ... The expectation is that there will be a net job creation.""
 
So, back to Palin's claim. She's correct that there is a program in the bill that would help displaced workers, but she paints a narrow view of how the bill will affect employment. Yes, some workers will be displaced and need to be retrained, but some experts are projecting growth and new jobs in industries that benefit from the new policy",Mostly True,"July 16, 2009"
"On the day the House voted on the climate change bill, ""there was not even a copy of the bill in the well of the House, which is standard. It wasn't even written.""","In Washington, it's not unusual for lawmakers to get as heated about the arcane rules of Congress as they do about the substance of a bill.
 
Such was the case with a plan to slow climate change passed by the House of Representatives on June 26, 2009. Republican lawmakers not only opposed cap-and-trade because they fear it will be too expensive, but they were angry that they'd had only a few hours to vet 300 pages of last-minute changes to the already massive legislation. With such a quick turnaround, ""pages of text were being passed around the speaker's desk by clerks,"" wrote Florida Rep. Ginny Brown-Waite on her party's blog. ""Who knows what we voted on? Members of Congress sure didn't.""
 
Then came this lament from Rush Limbaugh: On the day the House voted on the climate change bill, ""there was not even a copy of the bill in the well of the House, which is standard. It wasn't even written,"" he said during his June 29 radio show.
 
Limbaugh is right on at least one point: It is standard for the reading clerk — you've probably seen them on C-SPAN reciting the text of a bill — to have a copy of the legislation at their desk. So, we found it hard to believe that there was not one complete copy of the cap-and-trade plan in the chamber the day the House passed the bill.
 
But before we can solve the Case of the Missing Bill, we'll need a brief lesson in congressional procedure.
 
Before the House debates a bill, it goes to the chamber's Rules Committee, a group controlled by the majority party that has the important role of deciding which amendments can come up for a vote and how long debate will last. Frequently, the Rules Committee will also adopt last-minute changes to the bill, which can range from minor technical tweaks to big compromises. All those decisions are compiled in one long document — which is called, simply, a rule — and brought to the House floor where it becomes the chamber's first order of business before lawmakers can get to the meat of the legislation. If the rule is adopted, lawmakers have officially agreed to make all those changes to the original version of the bill. The House then takes up the bill itself.
 
The cap-and-trade bill followed this process. After the bill was passed by the Energy and Commerce Committee on May 21, its two lead authors, Reps. Henry Waxman and Edward Markey, set out to find enough votes in the full House. In the process, it appears the duo had to cut some deals; for example, one change made farms exempt from the emissions cap. And, not coincidentally, some farm-state lawmakers ultimately backed the bill.

In the early morning of June 26, more than 300 pages of changes were adopted by the Rules Committee. And later in the day, the House voted 217-205 to accept those changes.
 
After that, the chamber got down to debating the newly updated bill, and that's when the controversy over the missing copies began.
 
""Is there somewhere physically in the House of Representatives a copy of what we are voting on?"" asked Joe Barton, who is the top Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee.
 
""My inquiry is how do I get a copy of the other 300 pages that people here on the floor haven’t had a chance to read or see? Where do we get that before we slam this and cram this down on the American people?"" echoed Louie Gohmert of Texas.
 
Markey came to the floor to reassure Barton and Gohmert that they could find the latest changes on the Rules Committee Web site. And besides, they had just voted on the new language and it could be found at the reader's desk, Markey said.
 
But Gohmert wasn't satisfied. Here's an excerpt from the  Congressional Record  of his conversation with the the speaker pro tempore, the House member who then had the rotating duty of running the House:

GOHMERT. My parliamentary inquiry, I was just at the dais and the clerks, as always, were immensely helpful. But apparently the official copy of the 1,090 pages are there, and then the additional 300 pages are sitting beside it, and the clerk is having to go through and is in the process as we speak of going through and figuring out where the extra 300 pages that has been added goes in the official copy. So even as I speak, Madam Speaker, the official copy is not truly an official copy because it doesn’t have all of the amendments in it. And since the rule says there is an official copy at the desk, my inquiry is whether it is truly an official copy if it, as yet, does not have all of the pages in the official copy.
 
SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: The clerk is currently executing the order of the House in House Resolution 587.

GOHMERT. Right, to put the extra pages into the official copy. But is it required that it actually be a full official copy put together before you satisfy the requirement of having an official copy at the desk?

SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: The two components of the official copy are there together, so it is, in effect, the official copy.

GOHMERT: So the two together in two different piles that are being worked out together is the official copy.

In theory, House leadership could have called a recess to meld the 1,090 pages of the original bill with the more than 300 pages of changes as Gohmert and Barton wanted. But the leadership did not.

So to determine if Limbaugh is correct, we have to decide if two stacks of paper at the reading desk instead of one mean the bill was not on the House floor.

We went to House Parliamentarian John Sullivan, the guru of all things having to do with chamber procedure. He's been advising members on their rules since 2004.

""It's not true,"" he said of Limbaugh's claim. ""Obviously 'the' copy of the bill was at the reading clerk's desk the entire time. ... All the ingredients that made the final bill were at the desk,"" he said.

In fact, it's not at all unusual for pages of legislation to be in flux during debate, Sullivan said. For example, as amendments are adopted on the House floor, someone literally sits at the front of the chamber, adding or subtracting language in a bill. And it's a time-tested tactic for the minority to complain that the majority has rushed a bill through and not given members enough time to read it.
 
Limbaugh claimed that ""there was not even a copy of the bill in the well of the House. . . . It wasn't even written."" And indeed, it's clear from the  Congressional Record  that many lawmakers were frustrated that the copy at the desk consisted of two parts: the original bill and a second part that included changes that were compiled by the Rules Committee and adopted by the entire chamber. So in that sense, there is some truth to Limbaugh's claim that the bill ""wasn't even written.""

But the  Congressional Record  and our interview with the parliamentarian show that Limbaugh is wrong to say that there was no copy of the bill in the chamber during the vote. As Sullivan said, every component of the final version was in the chamber from the start, available for members to read. The final House bill, the one that was sent to the Senate on July 6, included all those changes; two documents effectively became one",True,"July 9, 2009"
"""Californians consume 40 percent less energy per person than the national average""","
President Barack Obama says California is a role model for energy conservation. 


In a June 29, 2009, speech to promote new light bulb efficiency standards, Obama said energy conservation will produce big results in the future, and cited California as an example.

 

""In the late 1970s, the state of California enacted tougher energy-efficiency policies. Over the next three decades, those policies helped create almost 1.5 million jobs. And today, Californians consume 40 percent less energy per person than the national average — which, over time, has prevented the need to build at least 24 new power plants.""

 

That paragraph is chock-full of claims to check, but for now, we're going to focus on the key point of Obama's statement: that because of long-standing energy efficiency standards, ""Californians consume 40 percent less energy per person than the national average.""

 

The White House provided us with a 2008 report written by David Roland-Holst at the University of California-Berkeley to back up Obama's claim. It said that Californians' electricity consumption is 40 percent below the national average. Had Obama specified electricity, he would have been correct. California's low electricity consumption is widely known. More than three decades ago, the state adopted building and appliance efficiency standards, and it required that electricity profits be separate from the amount of energy sold. This prompted utilities to offer incentives to consumers who save energy. 

 

Indeed, since the mid 70s, the amount of electricity used per person has grown by almost 50 percent in the rest of the country while California’s numbers remained relatively flat. For example, in 2006, electricity use in the entire country hovered around 12,000 kilowatt hours per person, while California's was approximately 7,000 kilowatt hours, according to a 2007 report by the the California Energy Commission, a branch of the state government. That's about 40 percent less than the national average.

 

But Obama

said

""energy,"" which includes other sources in addition to electricity, so that is what we are checking.


Our first stop was the Energy Information Agency, where we found that overall energy consumption per person in California is quite low. In 2006, individuals there used about 232 million Btu of energy, which includes natural gas, petroleum and coal.  The state's level was about 30 percent less than the national average of 333 Btu, which ranked the state 47th in the nation.


Statemaster.com, a database that compares states by demographics and economics, shows a similar pattern based on statistics from 2001; then, California ranked 46th in per capita energy consumption.

 

So Obama is correct with his underlying point that California's energy efficiency measures have reduced consumption dramatically, but he is off target with his statistic. It's actually 30 percent lower, not 40 percent as he said",Mostly True,"July 7, 2009"
"""If the United States moves ahead by itself (on cap-and-trade)... after 30 or 40 years, we're going to reduce CO2 by less than 1 percent.""","Shortly after the House of Representatives passed a cap-and-trade bill, some Republicans made this claim about the plan: Lowering carbon emissions in the United States will do little to slow climate change unless other countries do the same.

The GOP's position is that putting a cap on carbon dioxide emissions will be too costly for businesses and for consumers, and if the United States is going it alone those costs outweigh the environmental benefit.

Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, who has been one of the more vocal skeptics, made this argument on June 28, 2009, on  This Week with George Stephanopoulos. 

""If the United States moves ahead by itself (on cap-and-trade) ... after 30 or 40 years, we're going to reduce CO2 by less than 1 percent,"" he said.

He reiterated his opinion during a conference call with reporters on July 1, 2009, saying, ""If the United States would go ahead — because we're supposed to so-called set an example for the rest of the world — and if the rest of the world doesn't go along, then we're turning out to be suckers because we're — we're going to just reduce total CO2 by a spit in the ocean by ourselves.""

We wondered whether our cap-and-trade plan could be as limited as Grassley maintains — or at least whether Grassley's 1 percent prediction is even close.

Before digging into his claim, here's a little background on this complicated issue, one we've  already   explored  in terms of how much it  might cost  consumers. The bill, authored by Democratic Reps. Henry Waxman of California and Edward Markey of Massachusetts, was approved by the House of Representatives on June 26, and would essentially limit the amount of carbon dioxide companies can emit each year. The cap will become tighter and tighter over time, and ultimately, lawmakers say their plan will reduce carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020, and 83 percent by 2050.

Of course, those big reductions apply only to carbon emissions produced in the United States. Cap-and-trade opponents say it's foolhardy for the United States to move forward without some indication that other countries will adopt similar restrictions. But the European Union already has agreed to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020. And in July, members of the Group of Eight are expected to hammer out a deal on global emissions reductions.

Of greatest concern remains China, a country that has recently become the world's biggest producer of greenhouse gases. According to the Energy Information Administration, a government-run database of energy statistics, the United States contributed about 5,907 million metric tons in 2006 — or about 20 percent of the world's total. In the same year, China surpassed that amount by about 100 million metric tons, becoming the leading contributor to global warming.

New York Times  columnist Paul Krugman pointed out exactly this problem in a May 14 op-ed about China's economic development.

""China cannot continue along its current path because the planet can’t handle the strain,"" he wrote. ""The scientific consensus on prospects for global warming has become much more pessimistic over the last few years. Indeed, the latest projections from reputable climate scientists border on the apocalyptic. Why? Because the rate at which greenhouse gas emissions are rising is matching or exceeding the worst-case scenarios. And the growth of emissions from China — already the world’s largest producer of carbon dioxide — is one main reason for this new pessimism.""

The Pew Center on Global Climate Change, an organization that produces analysis on climate issues, had this to say: ""Climate change is a global problem and will require nations of the world to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It is true that the United States has recently been overtaken by China as the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, but the United States still contributes 20 percent of global emissions, so what we do is critically important. It is also true that if the United States acts alone, we cannot solve climate change.""

And Harvard economics professor Martin Feldstein offered some numbers to back up a similar opinion:

""Since the U.S. share of global CO2 production is now less than 25 percent (and is projected to decline as China and other developing nations grow), a 15 percent fall in U.S. CO2 output would lower global CO2 output by less than 4 percent,"" he wrote in a June 1  Washington Post  op-ed. ""Its impact on global warming would be virtually unnoticeable. The U.S. should wait until there is a global agreement on CO2 that includes China and India before committing to costly reductions in the United States.""

Less than 4 percent is close to what Grassley said, but we wanted to see some real data. So, we turned to a memo produced by two professors at Duke University's Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions who concluded that, ""the success of (Waxman-Markey) depends on whether other nations also pursue equivalent reductions.""

To illustrate their point, professors Tim Profeta and Prasad Kasibhatla plotted three possible scenarios using this handy  modeling system  (yes, you can  play along  , too). In the first, most developed countries — including the United States and some European nations — adopt something similar to Waxman-Markey, but developing countries do not; in the second, developing nations reduce emissions as well; and in the third, developing nations delay a reduction in their emissions, but eventually participate.

Their work shows that, under the first scenario, there would actually be a steady increase in carbon emissions, while under the other two scenarios — where developed countries pitch in — carbon emissions would decline over time.

So, Grassley's prediction is right — sort of, said Profeta.

""It's true that if the U.S. acts solo, we will see little impact,"" he said, adding that he's not sure where Grassley got his ""1 percent"" prediction. ""But that's a very unlikely assumption.""

We're more likely to see something along the lines of scenario three, he said, where China will adopt cap-and-trade at a later date, when its per capita carbon emissions equal those from developed countries.

We posed a similar question to Mark Radka with the United Nations Environment Program via e-mail.

""With no one else doing anything other than growing — a lot — and the U.S. singlehandedly reducing emissions along a not so aggressive path you might come up with a number like 1 percent,"" he wrote.  ""This would be one of those absurd baseline scenarios that really doesn’t represent a baseline in any other than a theoretical sense.""

And Alden Meyer with the Union of Concerned Scientists said it's a myth that China's doing nothing, pointing out that the country has embraced renewable technologies and set fuel economy standards that are arguably more stringent than those  announced  by the Obama administration earlier this year. ""You could say it's a drop in the bucket, but that could be said for any country,"" Meyer added. ""The risk of not adopting Waxman-Markey is that we give China the excuse to say, 'Why should we do it if the wealthiest country isn't doing it?'"" So where does that leave us? The experts we spoke with all agree that our impact on climate change will be relatively small without the involvement of other countries, particularly China. On this point, Grassley is correct. But, those same experts say it's highly unlikely that we would be the only nation limiting our carbon emissions in the coming decades. In fact, Grassley's statement is misleading in this regard because Europe already has adopted stricter goals than the targets we're considering, and China is taking other steps to reduce carbon production. As for Grassley's prediction that our cap-and-trade bill alone would only reduce climate change emissions by 1 percent, things are still murky. His office did not return calls or e-mails to back up that claim, our experts had never heard the statistic before, nor could we find any studies or documents to support it. The only number we've got comes from an opinion article written by a Harvard economist, who says 4 percent, which is in the Grassley ballpark",Half True,"July 2, 2009"
"Says the Congressional Budget Office estimates a cap-and-trade program would cost the average family the equivalent of ""a postage stamp a day.""","
Responding to Republicans who have said a cap-and-trade bill could cost thousands of dollars a year for the average family, the Democratic sponsors of the bill are citing a new study from the Congressional Budget Office that they say shows their plan will be affordable.

 

""For the cost of about a postage stamp a day, all American families will see a return on their investment as our nation breaks our dependence on foreign oil, cuts dangerous carbon pollution and creates millions of new clean-energy jobs that can't be shipped overseas,"" Rep. Edward Markey said in a June 22, 2009, news release jointly issued with the co-sponsor, Rep. Henry Waxman.


Waxman and Markey, from California and Massachusetts respectively, are the authors of a bill that would set up a market for power companies and other polluters to buy and trade carbon credits. The goal is to force them to cut their harmful emissions and lower carbon pollution 83 percent by 2050. But critics say polluters will inevitably pass the cost of buying credits or cleaner technologies on to the consumer. 


Putting a price tag on such a complex plan is tricky and controversial, as we note in our article

Your Guide to the Cap-and-Trade Estimates

. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, says that cap-and-trade could raise the average family's annual energy bill by $1,241. House Republicans have said that cap-and-trade could cost consumers up to $3,100, a figure they say came from a Massachusetts Institute of Technology report. But the writers of that report admonished the GOP for incorrectly interpreting their work; intially, the authors predicted it would cost consumers about $340 annually, and have since updated that estimate to $800.


Waxman and Markey are relying on a June 19 Congressional Budget Office analysis of their bill. The CBO is a well-respected, independent arm of Congress, but we have found its findings are occasionally mischaracterized by members of Congress. So we wanted to check whether Waxman is correctly summarizing the CBO's findings.


Indeed, the report cited by Markey and Waxman predicts the bill would have a net annual economywide cost of $22 billion — or about $175 per household — in 2020. Divide that number by 365 days, and you get about 48 cents. A first-class stamp costs 44 cents, so Waxman is close.


The CBO's estimate includes several assumptions about important decisions that still must be made by Congress, such as how much energy companies will pay to buy and trade polluting credits. But it's worth reading the fine print on this one, because CBO notes that the actual cost per family will vary depending on income. For example, low-income consumers could expect to save $40 a year, while wealthy people will see a net increase for energy costs of $235 to $340 every year. And the analysis does not include the costs or benefits of other parts of the bill, such as government efforts to quickly develop new technology, wrote CBO director Douglas Elmendorf in a June 20 blog post.


It's also important to note that the costs will vary year to year. As the bill stands, polluting allowances will initially be given away for free. But by 2035, about 70 percent of those allocations will be sold by the government. Supporters of the bill say federal revenue from the program would be used to pay for tax credits and rebates for the middle class. 


CBO chose 2020 as a milestone for its analysis because it's a point at which the program would have been in effect for eight years, giving the economy and polluters time to adjust. But had CBO chosen a later date, the cost per family may have been higher because the government would gradually be charging polluters more.


Waxman and Markey are clear about these variables and omissions in their press statement. They note that the poorest people will gain from the bill, and point out that the study does not include every element that could contribute to cap-and-trade's cost.


But critics are more skeptical of the report. By not including all variables, the CBO report ""grossly underestimates costs of cap-and-trade,"" said a memo from the Heritage Foundation, which has published many articles opposing the proposal. Among other things, Heritage says the study is flawed because it doesn't address economic changes resulting from restricted energy use and potential job losses.


For this Truth-O-Meter item, we are not addressing which study is best, but focusing on whether Markey correctly described the CBO's findings. He was close — off by just 4 cents — and he indicated it was an approximation because he said ""about a postage stamp a day",True,"June 25, 2009"
"Oil money from federal leases ""can only be used to clean up the mess and damages from drilling.""","
Floridians who support offshore drilling to rescue the crippled state budget will be disappointed, U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., warned this week.
 
The federal government limits what the offshore drilling revenues can be used for, Nelson said, and it doesn't include things like paying for public schools.
 
""I’ve had a few questions lately about this idea of Florida getting oil-drilling revenues to help with its sagging budget — and, things like schools,"" Nelson said in a statement on June 15, 2009. ""If you’re swayed by this argument and big oil’s latest push to put rigs off the tourism state, then you need to know something: oil money from federal leases cannot be used for that kind of stuff.  It can only be used to clean up the mess and damages from drilling.  Here’s how the law allows royalty money to be used: mitigation of effects from drilling activities through onshore infrastructure projects; associated planning and administrative costs; coastal protection; and, mitigation of damage to animals or natural resources. There you have it. No budget windfall. Fact is — oil money won’t build schools, or roads or pay teachers.  It’ll just 'mitigate' — slow down — the oil industry’s ruination of the fourth largest state’s economy and environment.""
 
Some background: In the Gulf of Mexico, which is the focus of the debate over more oil production, offshore drilling is banned within 230 miles of Tampa Bay and 100 miles of the Florida Panhandle through 2022. But in early June, the U.S. Senate energy committee approved a measure to allow oil and gas drilling just 45 miles off Florida's west coast.
 
Nelson strongly opposes drilling off Florida's coast, and has threatened to filibuster if the amendment is attached to a broader energy bill.
 
Nelson includes a key caveat in his warning about how Florida might be able to spend royalties from drilling. He notes that he's talking about

federal

leases. That's important because the federal government generally controls waters more than 10 miles offshore, while Florida and some other states control the waters inside 10 miles. So if Florida allowed drilling within those 10, it could use proceeds from oil leases however it sees fit, including for teacher salaries. (There's also a provision where the state could get some money for leases between 10 and 13 miles.)
 
Currently, four states receive money from federal royalties — Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. Under federal law, that money can only be used for protecting and restoring the coast through projects such as conservation, coastal restoration, hurricane protection, and mitigation of damage to fish, wildlife, or natural resources.
 
Nelson is generally correct about the requirements as they relate to those four states, said Eileen Angelico, a spokeswoman for the federal government's Gulf of Mexico Minerals Management Service. But you can't assume the same provisions will apply to Florida, she said.
 
""There's no guarantee that if Florida is added that it'll have to go along with the same rules,"" she said. ""(Congress) can write it however they want to.""
 
We think there's also a danger that people will misinterpret Nelson's comments, to assume that he means Florida schools could not profit from

any

offshore drilling. The fact is, Florida schools might benefit quite a bit if the state decided to allow drilling within 10 miles of its coast. States like Texas and Louisiana have reaped billions of dollars for their schools from offshore drilling leases.
 
Texas, for example, has reaped more than $3.5 billion in revenues from offshore drilling. Most of that comes from drilling within 10 miles the coast. The money goes into an education investment fund. Every year, the state taps that fund for $800 million for public schools, said Jim Suydam, a spokesman for the Texas General Land Office. It translates to about $400 per student, and is sometimes referred to as the school's textbook fund. Texas also will get more than $35 million this year from the federal government for its share of royalties on drilling more than 10 miles offshore, he said. That money is limited to mitigation.
 
So in fact, some gulf states have gotten quite a bit of money for their schools for allowing oil drilling off their coast. But that's mostly from drilling very close to the coast, within 10 miles.
 
Nelson correctly specifies that the restrictions apply to federal leases. And the legislation being considered by the Senate is for drilling at least 45 miles off the western coast of Florida (in other words, entirely federal waters).
 
We think many people might miss that distinction, however. Nelson's strongly worded statement will probably leave them with the impression that Florida couldn't get

any

education money from any drilling, when it could opt to do what Texas has done and use revenue from drilling within 10 miles for education.
 
He also is extrapolating the rules from other states to apply to Florida when in fact Congress still must address how the state would be affected. And it's conceivable that Congress could change the rules for Florida or the other states, and allow that money to be spent for broader uses",Mostly True,"June 15, 2009"
"""There has been no net global warming for over a decade now.""","A recent full-page newspaper ad from the libertarian Cato Institute takes issue with President Barack Obama's convictions about global warming. The ad cites then-President-elect Obama's Nov. 19 statement: ""Few challenges facing America and the world are more urgent than combating climate change. The science is beyond dispute and the facts are clear."" ""With all due respect, Mr. President, that is not true,"" the ad states in bold letters. Below that is a statement they say was signed off on by more than 100 named scientists. ""We, the undersigned scientists, maintain that the case for alarm regarding climate change is grossly overstated. Surface temperature changes over the past century have been episodic and modest and there has been no net global warming for over a decade now. After controlling for population growth and property values, there has been no increase in damages from severe weather-related events. The computer models forecasting rapid temperature change abjectly fail to explain recent climate behavior. Mr. President, your characterization of the scientific facts regarding climate change and the degree of certainty informing the scientific debate is simply incorrect."" Global warming is a complicated subject, and we're not going to flesh it all out here. But we did want to address the underpinning of this ad, the claim that ""there has been no net global warming for over a decade now."" First off, we should note that while there are some who disagree about the existence of global warming, the overwhelming consensus among scientists who study the climate is that it does, and that humans are worsening it. The definitive statement on global warming comes from a 2007 study by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of scientists from more than 130 nations. They concluded that the ""warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice and rising global average sea level."" The group also concluded that there is ""very high confidence that the global average net effect of human activities since 1750 has been one of warming."" The problem with the assertion in the Cato statement is that it is impossible to make meaningful conclusions about climate trends based on looking at a 10-year window, said Richard Heim, a meteorologist at the NOAA National Climatic Data Center Climate Monitoring Branch. People tend to think of global warming as a steady trend upward, Heim said, but that's not how it works. if you were to look at long-term trends, like a century, it looks more like steps. Temperatures wil rise for a few years, then level off or even go down a little bit, then go back up. That's why you've got to look at temperatures over many decades, he said. And if you look at the trends over the last 100 years, Heim said, ""the overall linear trend shows clear, unequivocal, unmistakable warming over that period."" Take a look for yourself at the  NOAA graph  of 100 years of global temperatures. Now, over the last dozen years, he said, global temperatures have largely plateaued. That's consistent with the trends. Typically, he said, climates will go up, then plateau until they reach a tipping point, and then rise again. ""What you are seeing in the last eight or 10 years is kind of like one of those steps,"" Heim said. ""The fact that it's not getting warmer doesn't mean we are not experiencing global warming. You can't talk about global warming over a 10 year period. The time scale is too short."" When you grab short time frames, say 10 years, it's easy to cherry-pick starting points that are particularly high or low to make your argument one way or the other. But even if you did select a 10-year frame — as cited by Cato — it would show a slight warming over time, Heim said. If you looked at just the last eight years, it would look flat. In fact, if you looked at the last four years, it would seem to be cooling. ""But this is crazy,"" Heim said. ""You have to look at the big picture."" Gavin Schmidt, a NASA climate scientist who was a reviewer on the IPCC study, called the Cato argument that there has been no global warming over the last 10 years ""fatuous and false.""

""What if I said that there had been no global warming for an hour? You would rightly tell me that this was too short a period for it to be meaningful,"" Schmidt said. ""The same is true for a 'decade'. But even so, it is false."" Schmidt directed us to a graph showing the 10-year climate trends using the four main temperature indices. The line bounces up and down like a lie detector graph, but the overall lines  all trend upward  . ""To be clear, the globe has warmed for the last decade,"" Schmidt said. ""You can get different results if you pick out your start dates carefully, a practice known as cherry-picking since it is trying to use the data
to say something other than what it generally shows, but you are much better off looking at the longest time scales you have (such as  these from NASA  )."" Cato cited a study on the internal variability of the climate system to support its claim. But the paper, from Kyle Swanson and Anastasios Tsonis, doesn't dispute the long-term trend of climate change, Schmidt said. He cited this conclusion from the paper: ""If the role of internal variability in the climate system is as large as this analysis would seem to suggest, warming over the 21st century may well be larger than that predicted by the current generation of models, given the propensity of those models to underestimate climate internal variability.""

Said Schmidt: ""Quoting this paper to support a claim that global warming has stopped is like quoting Ronald McDonald in support of vegetarianism."" In conclusion, most scientists who study climate say that cherry-picking a 10-year window is inappropriate. But in this case, cherry picking exactly 10 years (Cato said a decade) still doesn't support their claim",False,"April 1, 2009"
"If we got solar energy from ""an area of the Southwestern desert 100 miles on a side, that would be enough, in and of itself, to provide 100 percent of all the electricity needs for the United States of America in a full year.""","
Al Gore startled a Senate committee with an optimistic scheme for harnessing the sun's energy.
 
The former vice president sketched out the idea at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on climate change where he was the star witness.
 
""A technology called 'concentrating solar thermal' is now becoming very competitive,"" Gore said at the Jan. 28, 2009, hearing. ""

Scientific American

pointed out that if we took an area of the Southwestern desert 100 miles on a side, that would be enough, in and of itself, to provide 100 percent of all the electricity needs for the United States of America in a full year.""
 
In January 2008,

Scientific American

published an influential article titled

""A Solar Grand Plan.""

 
A conservative writer immediately attacked Gore's claim. The

Scientific American

article ""did not say we needed an area 100 miles on each side, which is 10,000 square miles,"" William Tucker of the

American Spectator


wrote

a day after Gore's testimony. ""The article stated, 'To meet the 2050 projection [of electrical demand], 46,000 square miles of land would be needed...""
 
Gore's spokeswoman, Kallee Kreider, said Gore had cited the wrong source — he intended to cite

this report

from Environment America, an advocacy group that promotes clean energy.
 
That report in turn cites the U.S. Energy Department, which does indeed say on

this Web page

, ""The solar energy resource in a 100-mile-square area of Nevada [otherwise known as 100-miles-squared, or 10,000 square miles] could supply the United States with all its electricity using modestly efficient (10%) commercial photovoltaic modules.""
 
That's a compelling source, but the apparent contradiction cited by Tucker made us wonder. So we called two of the authors of the

Scientific American

piece, James Mason and Ken Zweibel. They said that Gore was probably correct, and in fact their article — far from contradicting his claim — contains data that support it.
 
Mason and Zweibel said that when they wrote that 46,000 square miles would be needed to meet the electricity demand in 2050, they were assuming electricity would provide a much greater portion of the country's energy than it does now — including, for example, 344 million plug-in hybrid vehicles.
 
A 10,000-square-mile solar plant could well provide

today's

electricity needs, they said.
 
Here's how (dense math ahead; proceed with caution):
 
As graphics accompanying the print version of the 

Scientific American

piece indicate, the sun in parts of the Southwestern United States provides an average of about 6.5 kilowatt hours per square meter per day of solar radiation.
 
Take that 6.5 kilowatt hours per square meter per day and multiply that by the 365 days in a year and you get 2,372 kilowatt hours per square meter per year. We'll round it to 2,400.
 
Solar-electric systems could — optimistically — convert about 15 percent of that to electricity. That comes to 360 kilowatt hours per square meter per year.
 
You can't cram solar panels close together, because they would cast shadows on each other. For every square meter of solar panel in the southwestern U.S., you need 2.5 square meters of space. Once you account for that (by dividing 360 by 2.5), you find each square meter of a solar installation could produce 144 kilowatt hours per year.
 
There are 25.9 billion square meters in 10,000 square miles. Multiply that 25.9 billion by the 144 kilowatt hours that a square meter can produce in a year, and you get 3,729 billion kilowatt hours per year.
 
The U.S. consumes about 3,900 billion kilowatt hours of electricity per year, according to the

federal Energy Information Administration

.
 
So Gore's estimate was close enough considering the many uncertainties involved.
 
""I don't think you've found a serious blunder,"" said Zweibel, director of the Institute for Analysis of Solar Energy at George Washington University.
 
""Anywhere from 100 to 150 miles per side will easily produce all the electricity in the United States with any solar technology,"" said Mason, director of the American Solar Action Plan and the Renewable Energy Research Institute in Farmingdale, N.Y.
 
That said, there are all sorts of reasons why building a 10,000-square-mile solar installation would be even more difficult than it sounds.
 
For one, we would need a place to store the electricity so that it could be doled out in the dark night hours and on cloudy days. Mason and Zweibel suggest using the solar energy to compress air underground in caverns, old mines, aquifers and depleted natural gas wells. Then it could be released on demand to turn turbines that would generate electricity.
 
Also, we would need a vast new system of transmission lines. To pay for that and other necessary improvements, Mason and Zweibel call for $420 billion of government subsidies.

"""I have disagreed strongly with the Bush administration on this issue"" of global warming.","
During the second presidential debate, Sen. John McCain drew a distinction with President Bush on the issue of global warming.
 
""We have an issue that we may hand our children and our grandchildren a damaged planet,"" McCain said when environmental issues arose during the Oct. 7, 2008, debate. ""I have disagreed strongly with the Bush administration on this issue.""
 
He went on to say he traveled all over the world looking at the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, and introduced legislation on the subject of global warming.
 
But let's check the record – as we have

in the past

when McCain made similar claims on the campaign trail – and see if he was in fact at odds with Bush on global warming.
 
McCain spoke up about global warming in January 2003. And as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, he held hearings on the issue several years before that.
 
On Jan. 9, 2003, McCain and Sen. Joe Liberman introduced the Lieberman-McCain Climate Stewardship Act, which sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by capping them and allowing companies and utilities to sell or trade their emission rights.
 
When he introduced the bill, McCain called it ""the first comprehensive piece of legislation"" in capping emissions.
 
""The U.S. is responsible for 25 percent of the worldwide greenhouse gas emissions,"" he said. ""It is time for the U.S. government to do its part to address this global problem, and legislation on mandatory reductions is the form of leadership that is required to address this global problem.""
 
By contrast, the Bush administration has opposed cap-and-trade programs and preferred voluntary efforts on climate change.
 
Manik Roy, director of congressional affairs for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said McCain had actually been working on the climate change bill in 2001, but it got delayed after the 9/11 attacks. The Lieberman-McCain bill ultimately failed in October 2003 by a 43-55 vote, but Roy said it was a key step in ""educating the Senate"" about how government could respond to global warming.
 
""It is absolutely correct that McCain stood up on this issue, forced the Senate to focus on this issue when nobody else thought it made sense and did it with strong opposition from the White House,"" Roy said.
 
He called McCain ""a huge leader on this issue in the Senate",True,"October 7, 2008"
"""Palin (proposed) a $150 bounty for the severed foreleg of each killed wolf.""","
In a jarring television advertisement, the Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund attempts to show a less friendly side of vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin by noting how the Alaska governor championed an intensive predator management program.
 
""The more voters learn about Sarah Palin, the less there is to like. As Alaska governor, Sarah Palin actively promotes the brutal and unethical aerial hunting of wolves and other wildlife,"" the narrator says.
 
""Using a low-flying plane, they kill in winter, when there is no way to escape. Riddled with gunshots, biting at their backs in agony, they die a brutal death. And Palin even encouraged the cruelty by proposing a $150 bounty for the severed foreleg of each killed wolf. And then introduced a bill to make the killing easier,"" the narrator says. ""Do we really want a vice president who champions such savagery?""
 
For this item, we'll focus on this part of the ad: “And Palin even encouraged the cruelty by proposing a $150 bounty for the severed foreleg of each killed wolf.”
 
“The cruelty” in question was a state-sanctioned hunt intended to thin out the wolf population. Indeed, Palin’s administration announced the $150 bounty for the “left forelegs of wolves” as part of a larger effort to reduce wolf populations in five areas of the state, according to a press release from the Alaska Department of Fish & Game dated March 21, 2007. The payments are made to volunteer pilots and shooters who are permitted to track and kill predators in the winter months. State biologists planned to use the forelegs as specimens to study the wolf population.
 
Department spokesman Tim Barry said the idea came from state biologists and Palin’s office played a key role in developing the cash incentive program. Proposals of this nature ultimately are approved by the state’s Board of Game, which is appointed by the governor’s office.
 
The release contends the payment isn’t a “bounty,” but that’s a matter of semantics. An Alaskan judge who later declared the payments illegal called it a “bounty, pure and simple” in his ruling. In fact, the Defenders of Wildlife Action, which made this ad, was among the conservation groups that took Alaska to court over the incentive program.
 
What’s missing from the campaign ad is the context about wildlife management in Alaska, and the history of the program.
 
Unlike other areas where wolves are protected, Alaska officials estimate the state’s vast wilderness holds 7,000 to 11,000 wolves. These elusive predators hunt moose and caribou, which are favorite targets for hunters seeking food and sport in Alaska. In 2003, then-Gov. Frank Murkowski initiated the program to manage the wolf population.
 
In 2007, the state wanted to kill between 382 and 664 wolves, but the nearly 200 permitted hunters had shot only about 100 wolves as the hunting season neared its April 30 end. High fuel prices and limited snowfall made it hard to track the animals, so Palin’s administration offered the $150 per wolf as an extra incentive “to motivate permittees to redouble their efforts and to help offset the high cost of aviation fuel,” the release states.
 
The organization behind the ad, along with other environmental groups, filed a lawsuit to stop the payments because wildlife bounties were outlawed in 1984. About 40 wolves were killed after the bounty was offered, but the payments were never made to hunters. The judge struck down the incentive program 10 days after it was announced, Barry said. The advertisement is intended to shock viewers by presenting Palin without the context of political life in frontier Alaska, where wildlife management is a high-profile government function. But the facts are right and the missing context has more to do with sensibilities than factual accuracy",True,"October 1, 2008"
"Palin supports ""aerial hunting of wolves and other wildlife.""","
Produced by the political arm of the Defenders of Wildlife Action, a new television ad takes aim at Sarah Palin’s position on wildlife issues. The minute-long video starts by juxtaposing Palin’s darkened picture with majestic images of a bear and a wolf, while an announcer talks about her support for an aerial predator-control program.
 
""The more voters learn about Sarah Palin, the less there is to like. As Alaska governor, Sarah Palin actively promotes the brutal and unethical aerial hunting of wolves and other wildlife,"" the narrator says.
 
""Using a low-flying plane, they kill in winter, when there is no way to escape. Riddled with gunshots, biting at their backs in agony, they die a brutal death. And Palin even encouraged the cruelty by proposing a $150 bounty for the severed foreleg of each killed wolf. And then introduced a bill to make the killing easier,"" the narrator says. ""Do we really want a vice president who champions such savagery?""
 
The ad shows grisly video footage: low-flying aircraft with gunners leaning out the door shooting wolves and bears from the air. The plane later lands and the shooter finalizes the kill. In one picture, a wolf’s carcass hangs from one of the plane’s wing braces.
 
For this item, we'll focus on the claim that Palin promotes ""aerial hunting of wolves and other wildlife.""
 
Palin’s record on the issue is actually quite clear. As a candidate, and as governor, the Republican has endorsed wildlife management practices that include the controversial use of airplanes to thin out predator populations.
 
But in Alaska, frontier politics look different than they do in the Lower 48. Alaska has vast populations of wolves, bears, caribou and moose, and sportsmen who hunt and sometimes live off those species.
 
“If I am elected, I don’t want you to be surprised that I am a proponent of predator control in order to build those populations of moose and caribou,” Palin said, according to news reports from a gubernatorial debate in 2006.
 
Alaska state officials take issue with the use of the phrase “aerial hunting,” preferring “aerial shooting.”
 
“The predator-control program that we do — that isn’t hunting and we never claimed it is,” said Tim Barry, spokesman for the Alaska Department of Fish & Game. “It deliberately gives hunters an unfair advantage. That’s what we want.”
 
It’s tougher to assess the ad’s subjective assessment that such practices are “brutal and unethical,” though many wildlife groups would agree. Defenders of Wildlife has filed lawsuits challenging Alaska’s wildlife management practices. President Rodger Schlickeisen said his group takes the view that any killing of animals, outside of a biological emergency, is unwarranted. In September 2007, more than 120 scientists signed a letter to Palin that questioned the biological basis for the state’s intensive predator management.
 
Aerial hunting has been banned since 1972 in every state but Alaska, which gets around the federal law by claiming that predator population control is more important.
 
The ad is missing an important note of context. Unlike other areas around the United States where wolf populations are smaller, Alaska officials count between 7,000 and 11,000 in the state. Wolf populations are managed in five parts of the state as part of a program that began in 2003 under former Gov. Frank Murkowski.
 
In 2007, Palin’s administration proposed enhancements to encourage hunters to kill more wolves when it became clear that not enough wolves were being taken out of the population to meet the state’s goal for the year. Palin’s office announced a plan to pay hunters $150 for each wolf killed with the money to be paid when hunters turned in the left foreleg of dead wolves to state biologists. The program was axed by a judge who ruled it an improper bounty on wildlife.
 
“I have said many times that my administration is committed to management of game for abundance, and to a proactive, science-based predator management program where appropriate,” the governor said in a news release at the time.
 
We find her actions are adequate to support the statement that she promotes aerial shooting. But the environmental group’s categorization of the program is debatable and not putting it within the context of a state predator management program is a bit misleading",True,"October 1, 2008"
"""Gov. Palin ... is somebody who actually doesn't believe that climate change is man-made.""","Now that Sen. John McCain has chosen a running mate, Democrats have a target.
 
Within days of her ascension to the GOP ticket, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin came under attack by Massachusetts Democratic Sen. John Kerry for her environmental views. In an Aug. 31 interview on

This Week with George Stephanopoulous,

Kerry said this: ""With the choice of Gov. Palin, it's now the third term of Bush-Cheney, because what he's done is he's chosen somebody who actually doesn't believe that climate change is man-made.""
 
Kerry's claim is supported by an answer Palin gave in an interview with Newsmax, a conservative news Web site. She was asked for her ""take on global warming and how it is affecting our country,"" in an Aug. 29 interview published on Newsmax.com. She said, ""A changing environment will affect Alaska more than any other state, because of our location. I'm not one though who would attribute it to being man-made.""
 
But McCain is. As we explained in this item,

McCain was an early proponent of capping emissions

to combat the impact of global warming, a position he has touted in a campaign commercial.
 
Some other past statements by Palin suggest she has been undecided about whether humans are heating up the planet. An

Anchorage Daily News

candidate survey during Alaska's 2006 gubernatorial campaign that asked ""what role does state government have, if any, in addressing global warming and climate change,"" prompted Palin to answer, ""We need to analyze the potential economic costs, needs and opportunities associated with climate change. Let's be cautious in how we react – to make sure we don't overreact.""
 
On Nov. 4, 2006, just before her election, the

Anchorage Daily News

quoted a Palin spokesman, Curtis Smith, as saying Palin was undecided about the cause of global warming. ""She's not totally convinced one way or the other,"" Smith said.
 
In a

New York Times

op-ed published in January, Palin also signaled that she doesn't think scientists have made the case for human culpability. Palin said proponents of listing polar bears as an endangered species – which she opposes – were trying to ""force the government to either stop or severely limit any public or private action that produces, or even allows, the production of greenhouse gases. But the Endangered Species Act is not the correct tool to address climate change — the act itself actually prohibits any consideration of broader issues. Such limits should be adopted through an open process in which environmental issues are weighed against economic and social needs, and where scientists debate and present information that policymakers need to make the best decisions.""
 
In her home state, which has seen significant changes in its glacial landscapes, Palin is addressing the climate change issue. In September 2007, she created a ""climate change subcabinet"" to prepare a state strategy to respond to global warming. In a report to Alaskans in July, Palin wrote that the subcabinet ""will also be making recommendations to me on how Alaskans can save energy and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. ""
 
Palin's nod to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the context of global warming would suggest she's not entirely closed off to the idea that the two are related. Still, Palin's Aug. 29 statement was pretty clear: she doesn't attribute global warming to man-made causes, despite a broad, global scientific consensus that human activity is responsible for climate change",Mostly True,"September 3, 2008"
"In the wake of hurricanes Katrina and Rita, offshore drilling ""did not cause any real difficulties.""","At a town hall meeting in Albuquerque, N.M., John McCain promoted the idea of expanding offshore drilling, and downplayed the potential for environmental problems.
 
""Sen. Obama opposes offshore drilling,"" McCain said on July 15, 2008. ""I think if the states want to drill off their coasts, we should do it and do it immediately. And by the way, the governor of Florida has said he thinks it's a good idea. In California, Gov. Schwarzenegger thinks it's not a good idea. I would remind you that off the coast of Louisiana and Texas, they both had hurricanes that did not cause any real difficulties. So the environmental side of it I think is pretty well okay. But we need to do that. ""
 
McCain is referring here to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which hit the coasts of Louisiana and Texas within weeks of each other in 2005.
 
Consider the worst-case scenario of years ago: a drilling rig becomes unplugged and spews an unending supply of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. Back in June 1979, the Mexican drilling rig IXTOC I malfunctioned off the coast of Mexico and spilled about 140-million gallons into the Gulf before technicians were able to cap it 10 months later. To prevent that sort of disaster, rigs now have safety valves under the ocean floor that prevent spills even if the rig is damaged. Those valves worked as they were supposed to during Katrina and Rita.
 
But it's a stretch to say the storms caused ""no real difficulties.""
 
Without question, oil spills did occur offshore in the wake of Katrina and Rita. Studies commissioned by the Minerals Management Service, a division of the U.S. Interior Department, concluded that a total of just over 741,000 gallons of oil spilled due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the outercontinental shelf, the technical term for the area offshore.
 
""We have not said that there were no spills,"" said David Smith, deputy chief of public affairs for MMS. ""We've said that there are no reports of oil from federal waters reaching shore or causing environmental damage.""
 
Another MMS study looked at offshore oil platforms. It noted that the hurricanes crossed the path of about 3,000 offshore platforms, destroying 117 platforms that either became unmoored or fell into the sea.
 
""They were either completely toppled to the seafloor with no structure visible above the waterline, or were so severely damaged that it was obvious the structure was destroyed by the hurricanes and could no longer carry out its purpose and had to be removed,"" according to an MMS report. (You can view prestorm photos of the destroyed platforms via

this report

.)
 
Nevertheless, according to the MMS report authored by Energo Engineering of Houston, ""There was no life loss and no significant pollution, which is a tribute to the Minerals Management Service oversight of offshore operations and American Petroleum Institute design codes … for the structural design of fixed offshore platforms.""
 
Some of the oil spilled likely came from the pipelines that bring oil from the platforms to shore. When rigs are blown over in the storms, the collapse can damage the pipes, and that's likely what caused most of the offshore spills.
 
A McCain spokesman said McCain was referring to problems associated with offshore platforms, and that the amount of oil spilled from them was minimal. ""Senator McCain is exactly right, offshore oil facilities in the Gulf of Mexico stood up astoundingly well to the hurricanes,"" said spokesman Taylor Griffin.
 
Keep in mind, however, that Louisiana's oil business isn't strictly offshore. Oil is piped from rigs in the Gulf to the mainland of Louisiana, where it is stored and processed throughout the area.
 
""Offshore, there were relatively few spills,"" said Roland Guidry, head of the Louisiana Oil Spill Coordinator's Office. ""Inland, we have a lot of exposed pipelines and tank batteries along the shore. Those are the things that gave us trouble.""
 
Mostly onshore sources created oil spills that came to 8.2-million gallons, and possibly reached as high as 9- to 10-million gallons, Guidry said. That includes spills from platforms, pipelines, tankers, oil refineries and storage facilities.
 
The upper end of that estimate would place the gallons spilled near the same scale as the 1989

Exxon Valdez

spill, one of the worst environmental disasters in U.S. history. The important difference here is that the Valdez spill — at close to 11-million gallons — was highly concentrated, while the Katrina and Rita spills were from numerous sources and spread widely.
 
One of worst spills occurred at a refinery in Meraux, La., operated by Murphy Oil USA Inc., which before the storm handled about 630,000 gallons of oil a day. As Hurricane Katrina roared ashore, it breached an above-ground oil storage tank that disgorged more than a million gallons of oil into a residential area, tainting about 3,500 homes and businesses. As the result of a federal lawsuit, Murphy Oil agreed to a settlement that totaled $330-million.
 
A 2006 report from the U.S. Coast Guard detailed six major oil spills, including the Murphy Oil spill, five medium spills, and approximately 5,000 minor spills that occurred in the wake of the storms.
 
Environmental groups agree that the worst damage occurred away from the offshore drilling platforms, but say it's silly to think that the two things are unrelated.
 
""You can't have offshore development without the onshore facilities to support it,"" said Athan Manuel, a spokesman with the Sierra Club.
 
McCain's statement about drilling not ""causing any real difficulties"" is cautiously phrased in comparison to remarks from some other political figures.
 
Trent Lott, the former senator from Mississippi and a McCain supporter, said on MSNBC on July 15, 2008: ""We didn't have one drop of oil spilt when we had the biggest hurricane in recent history, Hurricane Katrina."" That statement is demonstrably false.
 
""The government data itself shows that there were spills,"" said Manuel. ""We're disappointed that that argument has taken root.""
 
The divide here seems stark: Oil drilling proponents view the damage as minimal, an acceptable part of doing business. They say safety precautions the oil industry put in place worked. Opponents of drilling, on the other hand, see the amount of oil spilled onshore and near shore as cause for concern, and are angered by attempts to minimize the real damage that did happen.
 
If McCain's point is that no individual well spewed large amounts of oil into the Gulf as a result of Katrina and Rita, he's correct.
 
But his comments at the town hall meeting were more vague. Talking about oil drilling and saying the storms ""did not cause any real difficulties"" seems like putting a happy face on a situation where damage did occur as a result of the oil and gas industry that permeates south Louisiana.
 
If McCain had been more specific about rigs versus oil development as a whole, we might be inclined to give him a better rating",Half True,"July 25, 2008"
"""John McCain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming ... five years ago.""","A new TV ad from the McCain campaign portrays the Arizona senator as a leader in the fight against global warming.
 
The ad begins with fast-paced music and horns honking. It shows black-and-white scenes of crowded freeways, smokestacks belching and a glacier collapsing.
 
""John McCain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming . . . five years ago,"" the narrator says.
 
The stark black-and-white scenes are replaced by more pleasant color footage of a wind turbine against a bright blue sky and water flowing through a dam.
 
""Today, he has a realistic plan that will curb greenhouse gas emissions. A plan that will help grow our economy and protect our environment.""
 
With images such as a newspaper headline that says ""McCain climate views clash with GOP,"" the ad portrays McCain as an independent voice on climate change.
 
Indeed, the

Congressional Record

shows that McCain spoke up about global warming in January 2003. And as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, he held hearings on the issue several years before that.
 
On Jan. 9, 2003, McCain and Sen. Joe Liberman introduced the Lieberman-McCain Climate Stewardship Act, which sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by capping them and allowing companies and utilities to sell or trade their emission rights.
 
When he introduced the bill, McCain called it ""the first comprehensive piece of legislation"" in capping emissions.
 
""The U.S. is responsible for 25 percent of the worldwide greenhouse gas emissions,"" he said. ""It is time for the U.S. government to do its part to address this global problem, and legislation on mandatory reductions is the form of leadership that is required to address this global problem.""
 
By contrast, the Bush administration has opposed cap-and-trade programs and preferred voluntary efforts on climate change.
 
Manik Roy, director of congressional affairs for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said McCain had actually been working on the climate change bill in 2001, but it got delayed after the 9/11 attacks. The Lieberman-McCain bill ultimately failed in October 2003 by a 43-55 vote, but Roy said it was a key step in ""educating the Senate"" about how government could respond to global warming.
 
""It is absolutely correct that McCain stood up on this issue, forced the Senate to focus on this issue when nobody else thought it made sense and did it with strong opposition from the White House,"" Roy said.
 
He called McCain ""a huge leader on this issue in the Senate",True,"June 17, 2008"
"""They (Clinton and Obama) have never to my knowledge been involved in legislation nor hearings nor engagement on this issue (climate change).""","On a so-called ""Green Tour"" of the Northwest touting his environmental record, Sen. John McCain was asked during a press conference in North Bend, Wash., on May 13, 2008, why voters concerned about climate change should back him over his Democratic rivals, Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
 
""I've been involved in this issue for many, many years,"" McCain said. ""They have never, to my knowledge, been involved in legislation nor hearings nor engagement on this issue. I have a long history. I've traveled around the world and seen the impacts of climate change.'""
 
Perhaps McCain should check the co-sponsors of emissions-reducing legislation he introduced with Sen. Joseph Lieberman last year. Both Clinton and Obama were among those who signed on to the Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act. McCain's cap-and-trade initiative includes a market-driven plan in which companies that significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions can sell emission allowances to other companies struggling to meet required standards. The plan aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60 percent from 2000 levels by 2050.
 
Last year, Clinton and Obama co-sponsored an even more ambitious plan called the Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act. If passed, it would require an 80 percent reduction to 2000 levels over the same time frame.
 
Clinton, who sits on the Senate Committee on Environmental and Public Works, has consistently supported legislation to combat global warming since joining the Senate in 2000.
 
In April 2008, Clinton was one of four U.S. senators who wrote a letter to the chair and ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies requesting $70-million for the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) and $270.3-million for state and local air quality grants.
 
Obama also has been active in climate change issues, and the Obama campaign quickly seized on McCain's statement. The campaign noted that Obama was the chief sponsor in 2007 of a bill to establish a Climate Change Education Program; that in 2007 he sponsored the Health Care for Hybrids Act, which offered government-subsidized health care to automakers in exchange for investing in alternative energy/efficiency technology; that in 2005, he sponsored an amendment to fund research to improve high-mileage plug-in hybrid cars; and that in 2007, he sponsored the Fuel Economy Reform Act, which would require an average fuel economy standard of 27.5 miles per gallon for all automobiles manufactured by 2013, and increasingly better gas mileage in subsequent years.
 
It's also curious that McCain mentioned his travels to see the impacts of climate change firsthand. In August 2004, Clinton was on the same trip as McCain to the fjords of Svalbard, a remote Norwegian island in the Arctic Ocean, where they took a mini-cruise to view the retreat of melted glaciers. (An article on the official Norway Web site in the United States features a photo of the heavily bundled McCain and Clinton standing next to each other).
 
The following year, in August 2005, Clinton was again in the legislative contingent when McCain traveled to Alaska to view melting permafrost and shrinking glaciers.
 
McCain's campaign did not respond to PolitiFact, but McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds told the

Washington Post

that opponents were splitting hairs over McCain's comments.
 
""Of the candidates who are running for president, there is no one who has demonstrated more leadership on the issue of global climate change than John McCain,"" Bounds said. ""I believe he was making that point.""
 
There's no question McCain has been a leader on addressing global warming, particularly among his Republican counterparts. But in trying to make that point, McCain grossly misrepresented his opponents' record",False,"May 14, 2008"
"""He positions himself as pro environment, but he scored a zero — yes, zero — from the League of Conservation Voters last year.""","The left-leaning organization MoveOn.org targeted Sen. John McCain in an e-mail to supporters, listing ""10 things you should know about John McCain (but probably don't).""
 
The list attacks McCain on a host of issues that include his policies, personal wealth and personality.
 
The final item attacks McCain for his record on the environment.
 
""He positions himself as proenvironment, but he scored a zero — yes, zero — from the League of Conservation Voters last year,"" the e-mail states.
 
McCain says he supports the environment. His campaign Web site brags: ""Along with his commitment to clean air and water, and to conserving open space, he has been a leader on the issue of global warming with the courage to call the nation to action on an issue we can no longer afford to ignore.""
 
It's also true that the League of Conservation Voters gave McCain a score of zero on its 2007 Congressional scorecard, placing him among eight senators who got doughnuts.
 
But there is a mitigating reason McCain got a zero. Of the 15 votes the league graded, McCain was absent for every vote — yes, every vote.
 
The other bottom-ranking senators actively voted against the league's agenda. Five voted against the league's preferred position on all 15 votes, and two voted against the league's position on 14 votes.
 
To find out if McCain really is the bottom of the barrel on the environment, we called David Jenkins of Republicans for Environmental Protection, who served on the league's scorecard advisory committee. Jenkins said McCain's record on the environment is significantly better than the league's scorecard shows, and his organization endorsed McCain for president in October 2007, during the Republican primary.
 
""If someone wanted to make the case that, as a senator, you should be there for votes, well, you could make that case,"" Jenkins said. ""But to say that it says something about his environmental positions is disingenuous.""
 
(We looked at another, similar controversy over

using missed votes to rate McCain's environmental record; read that story here

.)
 
The Republicans for Environmental Protection does its own scorecard, but McCain didn't do so great on that one, getting only 36 points on a 100 point scale. (The group's rankings are a little more complicated because they also award bonus points for ""leadership positions""; it's even possible to receive a score higher than 100.)
 
Despite McCain's low ratings, Jenkins considers him one of the three most reliable Republican senators on environmental issues. (The other two Jenkins named are Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe, both of Maine.)
 
MoveOn's words about McCain's environmental record are literally true — because he's missed so many votes. As we noted in our previous item, his average score with the group between 2001 and 2006 was 44.3, but the e-mail gives the impression that McCain is rock-bottom on environmental issues. We rate this charge by Moveon",Half True,"April 8, 2008"
"John McCain has ""a consistent pattern of ducking important environmental votes.""","In his bid for the Republican presidential nomination, Arizona Sen. John McCain hasn't shied away from citing his differences with Republican orthodoxy on the environment. On the campaign trail, for example, he's touted a Senate bill he is sponsoring to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to combat global warming.
 
It's a bill that has won McCain lots of friends in the environmental movement. So it was something of a surprise earlier this month when Sierra Club executive director Carl Pope sent out a tough missive condemning McCain as an ally of corporate polluters.
 
Urging Sierra Club supporters to write to their local newspapers to spread the word about McCain's poor environmental record in the Senate, Pope said McCain had ""a history of siding with the polluters and special interests, and a consistent pattern of ducking important environmental votes.""
 
For this item, we'll focus on the allegation of ducked votes.
 
As evidence, Pope cited a new study by the League of Conservation Voters examining crucial environmental votes taken in the Senate last year. Of the 15 votes the League studied, McCain was not present for any of them.
 
Under the League's strict methodology – dating to the vote study's origins in the early 1970s – a missed vote counts as one against the environment. As a result, McCain's environmental support score for 2007 was zero percent, a point Pope stressed in his letter. ""According to the scorecard, McCain was the only member of Congress to skip all 15 crucial environmental votes,"" he wrote.
 
Pope didn't mention that the strict methodology also turned Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, the Democratic front-runner in the presidential race, from an environmental champion into one of the least environmentally friendly Democrats in the Senate. His score dropped from a 96 in 2005-2006 to 67 last year. The drop was almost entirely attributable to missed votes. New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton also suffered for missing votes. Her score dropped from 89 in 2005-2006 to 73 in 2007.
 
The methodology is inherently unfair, says David Jenkins, a lobbyist for Republicans for Environmental Protection, a group that has endorsed McCain. He notes that McCain had a good excuse for missing votes: He was running for president against Republican challengers who had no similar commitments to keep them from the campaign trail, nor could McCain easily coordinate his absences with the Senate Majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, who schedules votes and was more accommodating to his Democratic colleagues, Clinton and Obama, according to Jenkins.
 
For his part, McCain has never scored very high on the League's vote study. Still, his average grade of 44.3 from 2001-2006, before his current presidential campaign and after his previous one, is actually the third-highest score among Senate Republicans.
 
And the League itself apparently doesn't think so poorly of McCain. In endorsing him for re-election in 2004, the group called him ""a leader on global warming"" and a ""strong voice of reason"" against a controversial plan to drill for oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. McCain, the League said, had also been a strong opponent of the Bush administration's energy policies, which have been widely condemned by environmentalists.
 
Even Rob Smith, director of the Sierra Club's Arizona affiliate, says McCain — while he hasn't supported the group in all of its local campaigns — has been ""a champion"" when it comes to preserving forest land in Arizona and reducing noise pollution around the Grand Canyon.
 
The case against the charge that McCain has ""a consistent pattern of ducking important environmental votes,"" is clear cut. Indeed, McCain did miss 15 important environmental votes in 2007, while running for president. He also missed five environmental votes scored by the League in 1999, during his prior bid for the White House. But those years excepted, McCain has missed only three of 212 votes scored by the League since McCain's first year in the Senate, 1987. That's not a consistent pattern",False,"March 4, 2008"
